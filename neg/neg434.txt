2020 lets start with the narrative i guess vanilla main storyline is quite awful while there are brief glimpses of wasted potential here and there in general it is going to be downright offensive to an old time fallout fan to illustrate that one only need to mention daily quests that involve players looking for lost plastic toys or picking up paper targets for a shooting range that nobody ever uses even the game itself tells you as much wastelanders expansion story content is admittedly better but still a dull affair as a whole here you ve got the token settlers vs raiders conflict going on even though they are as a matter of fact both just normal settlers really the difference between the two one group is a bunch of uninteresting surviviors who want to start a new life and the other is a bunch of surviviors who want to start a new life in a slightly more aggressive fashion and just happen to enjoy living in junk heap there are good things to be pointed out here as well though vanilla storyline offers players a great deal of freedom e g one can just skip all the way to the nukes section from the start provided said person s got the know how or bumps into some important clues during free form exploration meanwhile wastelanders story does have some neat albeit basic choice and consequence elements these features are nice to have in an online game however if you are an old time rpg connoisseur they aren t going to set your trousers on fire same can be said about the perk system which does appear quite promising at first players can have a lot of perks but can only equip a limited amount of them at any given moment planning said perk loadouts is in itself a fun and engaging procedure there are only two major types of perks overall utility and offensive prowess utility perks include crafting boosts lockpicking hacking carry weight reduction while the other half of the perk pool helps you out with increased damage for the weapon typeof your choice sneaking resistances hp vats accuracy and so on the challenge of buildcrafting lies in creating a perfect blend of both offensive and utility perks sounds juicy but inevitably there are problems you see when fighting a band of super mutants in the wild one might want to put everything into raw dps and sneak while during crafting and character management utility perks naturally become way more important as a result you will have to wrestle with this game s rather crappy controls and frustratingly bad user interface to keep switching those perks around rather frequently which is tedious and it could become rather annoying after a while adding a wee bit of turdy glazing on top of that issue is the fact that every single weapon type requires a total of 9 perk points put into a specific stat to max out its damage and that only really contributes to the power creep if anything and has a knock on effect of encouraging players to build characters to use only one weapon type combined with a 15 perk point limit to every stat and a lackluster legendary loot perk lineup it becomes quite hard to actually build anything remotely interesting in fallout 76 as an example say i want a silenced pistol build with sneak i can t have it since both sneak related perks and pistol perks are bound to agility and pistol damage perks alone are worth 9 points out of 15 maximum agility points no matter what you are going for what you will become in the end is the god of crafting with one specific weapon type focus thats all there is to it the rest of the game goes as follows uninspired public events time gated grind loops that offer very little in the way of gameplay improvement uninspired legendary equipment rather awful gear balancing pvp being an absolute cheesecake etc contrary to above mentioned the overall world design quality is pretty high you ll visit mutated jungle toxic mire a la far harbor point lookout a tall fully automated city dense forests a desert of ash power plants various installations that players can repair and exploit all of it lovingly crafted in true bethesda fashion hell some ski resort buildings had chained doors i could only open from one side key cards and intricate interior layouts kind of made me feel like i m playing duke nukem 3d for a second there the game has other minor plus points like real time vats turning out to be rather fun if a bit janky at first new power armor types character mutations seemingly improved hit location system increased amount of weapon modifications and some others minor things truth is however all of it doesn t even matter in the end the reason for that fallout 76 being a failure on a fundamental level because it simply does not work as an online game persistent online worlds and single player games are very different in the way they deliver the player experience e g wow classic is a proper online world where players have their respective roles they all affect one another in various ways be it trade crafting pvp clearing dungeons raiding or just plain old trashtalking players in a proper online world are often very limited in what they can accomplish alone to make them work together as often as possible to a reasonable degree of course it is important to have some solo play in an online game as well this is why say the grind in a game like wow classic doesn t feel as tedious player codependency gives it proper context and thats just but one example of course i m not saying that vanilla wow is the only way a studio can make an online game or a live service obviously weapon and perk balancing enemy difficulty grind length all of these things are irrelevant so long as there is no overarching grand design which in an online game has to involve people interacting with one another in some way after all is said and done fallout 76 is just a singleplayer experience with other players in that world just being a mere background and nothing more you don t have to team up with anyone you don t need anyone they might not even exist and i guarantee you wouldn t notice sure you can experience it with friends and maybe have a good time which is pretty important but its not likely going to last its worth mentioning that developers did promise an addition of an lfg system in near future but all things considered it alone won t really change much a roleplay can t happen if any one character can play all of the roles at once a good ol rough long grind is fine and all but if there is no purpose to it that sense of progress enchantment you re under is going to break sooner or later and the game would just feel empty then thats the real tragedy with fallout 76 wastelanders the way i see it not that nobody wanted it or it being a cash grab per se but rather this game being meaningless as an online experience thats what is so pathetic about it if all you want is a subpar singleplayer game with lots of time gated rewards grind and a paid subscription with an mtx store on top of that and no mod support fallout 76 might just be a game for you please do keep in mind however that you can always spend that money on a therapy session or maybe some powerful medication to help with that ocd just kidding go and play a good online game or a proper fallout like new vegas p s an online fallout game with a battle royale mode what a time to be alive
