early access review i loved this game i started playing on ps4 back in 2015 for years i wished i could get the new updates on pc and when i got a pc i couldn t wait for alpha 21 with all of it s new features but now this game has become unplayable for me i used to love building bases in the middle of nowhere and preparing myself for long trips to different cities with roaming hoards as a threat now you have to build near a city and force yourself to loot building after building just to progress through the game it doesn t even make sense why would i force myself to roam empty cities that clearly have zombies hiding in buildings the sunlight doesn t even hurt them the leveling progression is just sick just why if you wanted to force us through these buildings the magazine system wasn t the way you could ve put important crafting materials in the pois and we would have torn this apart it just sucks to see something i loved turn into something i don t even want to bother with i can t even get faster by running anymore and the stamina perks associated got removed i miss run forest run cries
