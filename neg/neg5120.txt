2017 so it took me a long time to write this review as a long time fan of the total war series i have easily put 500 hours into each of the previous games all the way back to rome total war 1 and i wanted this game to be good i tried so hard to find it fun which is why i am deeply saddened that this game wont be played for more than 100 hours by me for several reasons i will also note that i am a huge fan of the warhammer fantasy lore or setting so some of my thoughts are based on that knowledge this also has nothing to do with creative assembly s dlc policy which is appalling but not the point of this review but shame on you ca for charging nearly 20 bucks to unlock armies that are in the basic game just disgusting money grubbing first the good the battles are gorgeous the unit models are masterful and most of the armies are balanced for multiplayer single fights but honestly that s about it for the good the bad the entire campaign seriously the grand campaign is so broken unbalanced and unenjoyable i can t believe they put a game out i this state and haven t fixed it creative assembly loves to cut corners and saves costs wherever they can not that i blame them for that and in this game they used the guts of total war rome 2 and total war attila but instead of improving on the things that worked in those versions and making it better they seemed to take all the worst parts of those games along with some things that didn t work from even older versions and mashed it all together instead of a greatest hits album of total war games it is a worst mistakes album they put their time into making a game look pretty and completely ignored the ai and the warhammer setting i would honestly doubt if anyone on the creative assembly team knows anything at all about the warhammer fantasy setting the only solution the game has to counter a player who is doing well is to trigger a chaos invasion much sooner and stronger than normal i have gotten fairly far with vampire counts the empire dwarves and greenskins and they only way the game can counter a winning player is early and unbeatable chaos armies for example in my dwarven game i had the entire southern mountains controlled and 9 full 20 unit armies with a few good leaders what does the game do to challenge me chaos invasion 15 turns earlier than any other game i have played turn 45 if you wondered i went from being the strongest nation to the 5th strongest behind all norse chaos and beastman and magically one norse tribe spawned in the south yes norse from the desert because that makes sense right right off my coast with 15 full 20 unit armies all with elite units with experience i couldn t have taken that many on if all of my forces were together and why would they be together that early add to that that every single chaos and norse army completely ignored every other nation on the map and went straight for me in the bottom corner i ended up having 48 full 20 unit armies that completely waved over me in 8 turns how on earth is 48 armies to 9 a fun or good challenge and this is what happens in every game the secret is don t do well and chaos will not spawn all powerful so you know don t win is what ca wants now i know chaos is supposed to be crazy powerful and a challenge but as it stands it is not it isn t a challenge it is suicide creative assembly s design team should be sat in a corner to think about how to design a game because this is not the way again shame on you ca the verdict i would not recommend this game even for the 12 dollar humble monthly price unless you have a friend to play multiplayer battles with the campaign is broken the races aren t fun to play and because the game and ai are just so terrible the game cheats blatantly and constantly but not in a challenging way in a not fun to play way so way to go creative assembly you have taken a game series i love and a setting i love and dashed the resulting game on the rocks this will probably be the last creative assembly game i ever purchase and i would encourage you to learn from my mistake and not give them any more money until they figure out how to make an almost year old game playable and fun edited for spelling and grammer changes
