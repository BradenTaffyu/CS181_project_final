2017 a tl dr who don t want to read a lot to know if they should buy the game why you should you buy this game please note a mod may be needed to fix any performance issues you may have you should buy this game because the story characters world and atmosphere in it are all phenomenal and are far from mediocre it does not push ideas or agendas into your face and can be enjoyed at face value and has enough depth to be enjoyed by the player who wishes to look deeper into the story for its thematic value the gameplay is also very satisfying and doesn t get overshadowed by the narrative so you ll be enjoying the usual platinum hack and slash gameplay while experiencing a good story that you don t have to fully be invested in why you shouldn t buy this game the game although it has a great narrative and equally great gameplay suffers from poor optimization on platinum s part it will run fine on higher end hardware but users have also stated that mileage may vary even if you meet the minimum or recommended specifications you will need a mod to fix this game if you suffer from performance issues that tweaking cannot fix it should also be noted that there has been no official fixes since it s release on the 17th of march and far has been the method for users to receive a proper experience i would recommend not buying it on pc for these vary issues even though i have no problem with modding it is therefore safer to get it on ps4 where you will receive a optimal experience from the minute you purchase with no worries if you will need to adjust anything after presenting these two sections i will state that it is ultimately up to you to decide if you want to purchase this game on pc or not if you do not have a ps4 and really wish to play this game then i say go for it and buy it when it is on sale and only then if you have a ps4 then do yourself a favour and buy it there it will be much better i assure you now here s the long version for those who want a more in depth opinion so why is the story amazing the story is very well paced and is ingrained in every piece of the world along with every sidquests the side quests are enjoyable and makes the world more believable and real to the player you grow along with the characters from beginning to end and allows you to experience the narrative at your pace the story has fun with itself and has a little bit of everything from depressing scenes to comic relief that all seem fitting for the story you never mentioned the music is that any good i could go on forever about the music of nier but i think i will let my favourite track from the game show you why the ost is gold gameplay the gameplay in nier automata can be described as the love child of bayonetta and metal gear rising all the weapons feel and sound like you d expect them to swords and other metal weapons give off a nice metal clang and shink sound effect as hit your enemies along with other weapons like the cyprus stick giving a nice hollow and wooden feedback for hitting things animations in automata are fluid and believable with all main characters being unique in their individual animations it s amazing to think that platinum not only created individual characters that look so different but also feel different in their playstyles and personalities as they fight this not only makes you feel more connected to your character but all the more makes the combat more fun and enjoyable it s platinum game s most refined gameplay and any fan of their games will feel right at home and constantly amazed by the depth of the combat and easy to use and accessible combat and movement i see there s dlc for the game should i get that with the game only if you are a fan of the original nier and have spare cash to burn otherwise don t it s very poor dlc and adds nothing to the story and it s a fluff sidequest that can be completed in a couple of hours with no feeling of reward except skins from nier replicant again only buy this if you are a fan have and have spare cash otherwise it s not worth it at all in conclusion this game was obviously made with love and care from the gameplay to the sound and story it is a joy to play when it works well i ve already stated all of my issues concerning the pc port and although i have gushed about how good a lot of the game is the optimization leaves much to be desired as long as you don t hate modding it will more than likely run fine if you do end up running into performances issues but i cannot promise that it will work for everyone if you really want to play this game and do not have a ps4 then by all means pick this game up on steam and try it out if it runs horribly then install far and try again if it still doesn t work then sadly you ll have to refund or bare with the poor performance on your system it will more than likely never be patched because of square enix and their bad reputations with games that aren t final fantasy and this is the state of the game on pc for good granted it still is a good game but it will take some work to get on pc i repeat from the beginning of the review the final decision is up to you and you should only use my opinions to decide for yourself if you wish to get it on the pc platform if you do i hope it runs well for you and i also hope you enjoy the wonderful world and game that yoko taro and platinum games have made
