2018 so it had been a few years since i looked at civ6 so over the holidays i decided to get the gathering storm dlc on sale and give it another go to see if any of the issues i originally despised had been corrected short ans i still don t like civ 6 if you want to enjoy a better version of this game get civ 5 on sale although the unreleased humankind game does look very good too they have made some minor adjustments and very minor improvements since release but the game is still slow the movement and general tasks of this game is atrocious when compared to what you can do civ 5 moreover the learning curve for how things actually work is still significantly higher than civ 5 and the in game civ o piedia is really worthless about the only good thing i can say is that they did get some better balancing mechanisms together in a few places then what was originally there anyway i ll leave my original review below as almost nothing that i wrote then is out of date with the current version now with the only exception being this there is a bit more balance on the tile production now versus then so the districts sucking up resources is still sort of an issue but only if you don t go online and find the data on how to place them correctly and space your cities correctly which can be a difficult thing to actually accomplish civ 5 is not perfect by any means but i still think it is better than this and there are plenty of active modders still working on it i ll stick with it from here on out 2k will not get another dime out of me for civ6 oh i almost forgot the game still has glitchy bugs its been around since 2016 and they still have menu placement bugs are you kidding me its more then just that some units are bugged too nothing completely game breaking but yea after 4 years and all the updates you should still expect to see bugs in the program if you buy it what crap original review below at this point in the development of the civ6 game i would recommend for those interested in this type of game to purchase civ5 instead the basic mechanics of this version need some serious work in essence it plays you you do not play it don t get me wrong there are several things that civ6 improves upon over civ5 but many of the great features of civ5 have been lost or thrown out for whatever reason these can truely make the game extremely tedious at best and utterly frustrating if you are already familar with the mechanics of civ5 already pros of civ6 over civ5 better political game play definitly a large improvement in working with ai players better information available on how to play trade with the ai leaders not perfect by any means but an improvement none the less slightly better graphics i really did not need better graphics or additional animations from civ5 but i can appreciate that civ6 did make some improvements in these areas cons of civ6 over civ5 failures of available information two simple examples 1 the trade route menu 2 the help menu in civ5 if you wanted to find out what was the best trade route to use next then you would click on the trade menu and a nice graphic matrix would pop up and allow you to sort it by all of the different information columns typically in 3 or 4 clicks i could sort it out in a minute and be on my way alternately in civ6 you have a single long list no sorting lots of repeats it really is an information cluster f to be fair it looks like there are buttons that should be available for some simple sorting but they don t work at least in my game and even if they did this still would not fufill even 1 2 of the possible options of play sometimes when i click on the trade route menu nothing shows up at all so maybe its a bug of some sort idk the help menu in civ5 if there is something in the game you can find it in the help menu may take a bit but for the most part it is there in civ6 there is a lot of information missing if you don t have access to the internet forget about it you may have to save the game and just try it but you should be prepared to go back 10 to 15 turns to undo that attempt at learning there is just a lot more information available in civ5 about what your cities and units are doing or costing you information that you can use to adjust your gameplay and make improvements which leads me to my last major con time to complete it takes forever to accomplish simple things this is partially just how the game is but it really seems to me that it is easier to speed things up in civ5 with the right resources and build options then it is in civ6 some other thoughts on civ6 deficiencies one of the new items in civ6 is the stackable units they sell this as the ability to create armies you know a whole army infantry machine gunners tanks artillary nope it s not that it is just a slightly more powerful unit of the same type of course you can t easily determine if this is actually an improvement or not what is the cost benefit can t tell there is no information available to determine the cost of a corps vs a unit but now you have only a shot from that corps instead of two shots from two units the districts the new concept of building districts around your city instead of buildings in your city is interesting but currently flawed the failure to provide additional workable tiles around the city still stuck at 3 tile radius really makes this difficult in many situations especially if you are working with a captured city from an ai player the ai cities do not play under the same rules which is fine until you capture one and have to work with what they left you at least in civ5 you could build a settler and then raze the ai city at a later time that is not an option now you can choose to raze a city only if you capture it by force and only at that exact moment also you cannot move districts pick the wrong spot and did not figure it out until later in the game tough cookies your stuck with it now want to trade a district from one city to another that the ai built to close nope can t do that silly why would you want to do that city state envoys great concept why do they have to all die when an ai player takes over the city state taking with them thousands of years of effort also not sure not happy about it either some other thoughts on the civ game in general why can i not buy and sell land this seems like a perfectly reasonable way to negoiate with neighbors and make sure that we can actually get along the land tiles are the most important aspect of the game why is the concept of trading land rights so foreign unincluded in these games also why do i need a city to hold on to captured land i need a city to work the land obviously but if i capture a city and raze it to the ground why do i have to give up the land rights i only need an army to hold on to land not a city anyway buy civ5 at a sale event wait a few years for civ6 to fix itself myself i am going to learn how to mod civ5 with the good parts of civ6 and then play civ5
