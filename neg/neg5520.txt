2019 it s a shame i have nearly every total war game and yet the fact that to get all the dlc at 66 off is still over 40 and most of the game isn t even worth playing unless you purchase everything you even have to pay 3 just for blood i understand some games do this payday 2 for instance but they make it to where what you want is not going to be a complete game changer and they don t charge 60 for a game almost a decade old and then charge nearly 130 just to play the game the way it s supposed to be played in the first place i m glad i got this game on sale i m glad i paid 2 for the greek cities i don t plan on purchasing anything else because i d rather burn my money than spend over 120 on dlc
