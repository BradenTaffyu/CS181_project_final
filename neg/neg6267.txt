2023 early access review edit i came back to this game because no other card game offers what marvel snap has with the short match times and cube betting system with that being said progression and monetization are still as bad as they previously were new and returning players will have a terrible time attempting to progress the game does not even make it easy to whale out and try to catch up because of the spotlight system with the money they have made the interface and menu bugs should be gone but it is a constant problem the collection screen constantly displays the wrong info or when attempting to claim rewards you get errors forcing you to restart the game the money must be going straight to ben brodes pocket and not the betterment of this game bring back the old system fix the bugs and bring down more cards to series 3 and this game will be great again with the recent release of the spotlight cache system there is so little motivation to play this game regular caches are near pointless as a player that is series 3 complete theres so few sources of gold now that theres no chance of spending goldon shop skins saving for big bundles is so time consuming for such minimal return its pointless the fact that the spotlight caches still have chance to give you tokens a pixel chibi skin or just a random s4 outside of the shown pool makes the system feel sobad for player agency every update just feels worse and worse as a new player you might get someenjoyment but for veterans it does not feel worth playing
