2016 at first you will love this game as much as i did if you are generally into these types of games once you get past the initial thrill and the illusion of endless complexity you will hit something called a very stale midgame with hardly any variety and an extremely poorly coded ai that will rip you out of your immersive bubble and show you the game for what it really is major mechanics like the ai managing sectors are currently utterly broken a lot of buttons are purely cosmetical and have no actual purpose at all do you want the sectors managed by the ai to focus on mineral production or energy production too bad all the ai does is build farms on your planets anyway regardless of which option you ultimately choose do you want to allow the ai to replace existing buildings on planets beautiful the ai actually razed one of the many unnecessary farms only to replace it with guess what yes another farm such variety such intelligence i am actually shocked how such a poorly coded ai made it past qa in the first place will dlc make this game better most definately but why should i pay for features that were promised to be in the base game to begin with this new business practice of hastily releasing broken and unfinished games only to be fixed with paid dlc i for one am sick of it
