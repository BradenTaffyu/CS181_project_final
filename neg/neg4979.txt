2019 i ve been a fan of total war games for a very long time there s a lot to love about this game initially however for the price point the continued milking of customers the waste of budget money to implement drm and relying heavily on modders to do what they don t feels like it wasn t money well spent they brought a couple new things to the table but at the end of the day it s just another total war game to me been there done that after a two week binge it s just sitting in my library collecting dust i m not even tempted to pay for the cut copy pasted content that should of been included for the base game i m going to stick around and keep my fingers crossed that one day ca steps out and tries something new
