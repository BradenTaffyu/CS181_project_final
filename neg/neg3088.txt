2023 overpriced by a lot but good coming from some other comparable games rimworld s not the deepest most polished or most mature so why s it the most expensive around 100 for the game and dlc but don t get me wrong it s a good game but you can get more for less no regrets in picking it up i just expected quite a bit more
