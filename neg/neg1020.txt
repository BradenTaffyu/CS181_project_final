2015 leaving this review makes me quite sad here s the bottom line unless you are a major fan of the franchise i can t recommend buying at this time i m hoping that bethesda will take responsibility and fix their product but you know what they say hope into one hand into the other and see which one fills up first if you re on the fence give it around 3 6 months and wait for a sale i mean it says something when the best fallout games we ve gotten in over the last ten years have been obsidian s fallout new vegas and wasteland 2 pros the game s graphical update is quite welcome especially with all the colors the settlement system is a cool idea animations on some enemies e g the way feral ghouls flail about mirelurks turtle up and charge etc is phenomenal running or sneaking around exploring places and looting things is reasonably enjoyable the additional weapon variety and the crafting to be able to reforge the weapon you ve been using into an entirely different role is great the fact that there are populated vaults with something that s capable of talking rather than shooting is nice your companions will converse with nearby npcs which is a welcome touch the game doesn t restrict you from being polyamorous if you choose to do so that s about all i can think of in terms of positives everything else where to start what s with the story i d accuse it of copying fo3 but at least in fo3 the father had interesting motivations and was working on harnessing fascinating technologies that would affect the entire wasteland here it s essentially a cutscene that says here s this person you love that s now dead here s this other person you love that s now kidnapped fond slap on the bum go get em tiger the usefulness of all items seems great on paper but it absolutely tanks the pacing as you inevitably end up spending hours ferrying around endless amounts of trash the game doesn t explain anything which i wouldn t be an issue except for how there s a bunch of things implemented in odd ways for example there are been functions i learned about only after being told about them by friends functions like getting out of your power armor without waiting for the battery to fully drain the traits menu is pretty but inefficient at communicating information i prefer the older text interface the pc port is straight up horrid why does leaving the framerate unlocked with the physics and game speed why do are certain functions perma bound to certain keys why does the melee attack and grenade have to share a button why are some functions using multiple buttons but are not usable interchanably why are the loading times absolutely abysmal why does the game feel like it hasn t been even remotely optimized the ai oh man npcs taking cover seems great except they always leave a large portion of their body exposed also companions are often worse than useless the number of times my super sneaky character was discovered because a companion would refuse to get out of the open or would pull everyone by charging into combat as i m trying to sneak away or would block my path of escape from a grenade at my feet agh one would think that converting a classically silent protagonist into a voiced one would have entailed doing a quality job apparently not whatever happened to the whole role playing aspect of fallout remember how in the older fallout games you could be sir benevolent the 3rd or lord mcbastard the 5th here we ll have none of that lip you re a good guy locked into the role of being a good guy fighting for whatever has been pre determined as being the good guys about the most evil thing you can possibly do is request more caps from the npcs as quest reward and even then there are absolutely no consequences so you have no reason to not do it the conversation system is atrocious not only do you have less agency in your decisions than you have in a telltale game the game steps on the same rake as heavy rain by having one word vague descriptions that are generally very misleading to what your character actually will say i suppose at least this thing saved bethesda a ton of cash by limiting the dialogue options after they made the incredibly misguided decision to voice act everything i understand that the karma system from before had its issues but the replacement is an utterly useless irritation the settlement interface was built for three handed mutants not only that good luck with getting things to line up nicely or not float in mid air also terrain detection seems to work sparingly at best e g i ve tried planting a melon on a surface where sometimes the same patch of ground will show that you can but sometimes can t plant it the bugs oh the bugs i know that the community is going to help out with most of this but i think it s an abhorrent practice to have a aaa publisher release a full price title and then outsource the qa to the community here are some of my favorite examples picking a lock hacking a terminal checking your pipboy or switching weapons has a chance to make it go invisible leaving you stuck taking back power armor that was stolen from you leaves it marked as stolen if you die during dialogue the subtitles will remain on screen and the clip that played during your character s death will continue to play at random intervals some walls are only solid and present to you the number of times i ve been shot by bandits through a solid brick wall ugh floodlights tend to regularly break nuking the framerate and leaving a massive white void
