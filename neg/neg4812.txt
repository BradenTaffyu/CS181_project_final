if you own warhammer 1 and the dlc s then i would recommend this game but if your like me and don t own the first game i would tell you to save your money and never buy a warhammer total war title throughout the rest of its existence everything beyond the first warhmmer is pay to play they lock large amounts of content behind a pay wall that requires you to buy the first warhmmer and its dlc s in order to unlock the second dlc s in warhmmer 2 and so on with warhammer 3 they are just ripping us off at this point with reskins the game is cool but not worth spending over 150 just to have a full experience i lost a lot of respect for total war after seeing this disgrace
