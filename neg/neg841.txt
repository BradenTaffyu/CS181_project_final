2016 a living proof of not only how little companies care for their franchises as long as they make money but also how they are trying to dumb down the actual generation of gamers with ubersimplistic games with a handful systems on it that requires barely any effort to develop simply put it gives you unlimited hours of repetitive content with no depth there s also no replayability and barely any rpg elements making it a chore that focuses on shooting rather than finding solutions to a problem using your character strenghts it sure doesn t deserve to be part of a franchise that was well known for it s role playing elements but also its focus on meaningful content if you think otherwise you clearly haven t played previous installments or have little care or respect for the franchise also we got paid mods as the last nail in the coffin if you continue to defend this you not only have no respect for the franchise but also for yourself as a consumer all is left to say is thank you todd f4 will be always remembered for its great accomplishments
