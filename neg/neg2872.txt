2016 unfortunately the game is weak already played through on hardest and managed to dominate the ai while making numerous errors and being essentially stuck and unable to colonize in the early mid game i was hoping for a euiv in space you have a force limit you have to have a cb to attack regions of space etc etc this game is like every other 4x game in fact it is a step back to something like the still unsurpassed distant worlds for the sake of this review i am going to compare it to such edit finally ran into all of the bugs i have had the ai send a 5k stack of ships one at a time instead of a fleet across my sector i have zoomed into a fight and then zoomed out to the map only to have a destroyed battleship replace the stars in the background as well as numerous graphical glitches the save load broke where when i loaded a game it would take me to empty space with nothing in it losing me hours of progress i have had a fleet stuck unable to decide between two starbase on which one to attack and just flying in circles not to mention that wormholes are broken with allies the world is lifeless distant worlds had a public and a private sector so you could see public sector ships flying through space grabbing resources and hauling them back to the colony none of that here you build a science or mineral outpost and thats it the ship building is also useless the modules are boring as all hell you just have laser i then 2 etc why even customize the ships in distant worlds you had complete freedom to add modules to the ship up to their limit you could make ships as small or as large as you like star drive also had an inovative system where you can places modules on a grid even gal civ 4 allowed you to customize the look of the ships colony management is still in the dark ages blockers adjecency bonuses these are all tired worn concepts dumping everything into sectors just to get rid of the tedium is not a solution sectors should be the primary means of control not systems diplomacy what diplomacy on hard and up it is extremely difficult to get alliances or form federations so that mechanic is all but wiped out federation 10 year time puff puff pass mechanic is silly anyway they built a game like ck2 where you could have a family a lineage gain and lose huge regions of land in one generation and here we are back with the staid governors etc what a waste protip built massive amounts of mineral resources don t focus on energy befriend another empire who also gets massive energy reserves that they do not use and keep trading minerals for energy and win pro er tip you cannot run into debt so in the end retool everything to minerals and win with your massive 200k doom stacks energy maintenance wtf is that i used the red shard tech as my only offensive tech and won battleship more like here comes 50 corvettes up your ass all evading your shots the game is broken as is but maybe in some magical future world paradox carves it into a gem i live in the present i don t live in the what if they distant worlds you could get creamed by pirates massive alliances late game invasions here you have terrible ai to deal with who never attack you as well as a few roaming monsters that do nothing until you attack them it gets worse if the ai were to become super agressive you would be all but wiped out because of the bonuses they receive i have a feeling this is why you are never engaged it would make the game unplayable on harder difficulties edit the ai is even worse than i thought which explains their passive nature my vassel was declared on by a large empire they took ages to finally move their superior fleet into my territory while i huddled my ships in a corner waiting for the end they proceeded to attack my home world destroy the station then they split their fleet with one half buggering off to some distant corner of my empire and the other being immediately ambushed by my fleet and destroyed a further note while most 4x titles have some kind of limitation on the range of your ships i e distant worlds has fuel this game allows you to just hop to ends of the universe effectively making wars highly one sided with no ability to recover as you never have to retreat your forces from enemy territory you destroy all their starbases and win distances are too long fleets take too long to rebuilt wars are unrecoverable micromanagement is from the dark ages here in distant worlds you can automate everything or nothing it is up to you yet here in 2016 in stellaris i cannot assign production orders edit i want to stress how insane this oversight is when you queue up two ships for instance resources are deducted for both even though only one is being built if you are attacked you can simply cancel and receive all of your resources back even if the ship is 98 built wtf paradox that s programming year one to stations or rally points i have no control over my fleets in battle so i sit and watch as they spread damage over the entire enemy force instead of focus firing worst of all i cannot automate the science and construction vessels i have to shift click every single debris research in a sector of my god are you kidding me overall the game is clearly unfinished this is a bare shell wich might hopefully be filled by future development but do not buy it yet wait until it is patched severely and content is added this is another in a long string of dissapointing 4x titles you can do better paradox this is a space 4x game and i have already beaten it on the hardest difficulty that is saying something edit the positives i did have a very cool moment where my race became so populace that when i declared war on the once mighty bird people i find that their leader is a member of my race having presumably stabbed his way to leaderhood i have to admit that that was a new one never saw that before in any 4x
