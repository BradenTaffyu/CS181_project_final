2017 let me start off by stating that i have always tried to stand by my decision to support bethesda s products i loved morrowind oblivion fallout 3 fallout new vegas and skyrim all to death however there comes a time when i just cannot agree with what is being done by them fallout 4 is a good game just not a very good fallout game instead of deepening the rpg experience bethesda has chosen to water the game down in favor of a broader audience and to make it easier for all overall they made several improvements i would happily have used in previous titles but they took major steps backwards as well the story depth player interaction choices and focus on settlements instead of doing something productive has taken this game from what could be a masterpiece to an overall shameful display alongside this there are blatantly game breaking bugs that bethesda could have fixed at any point along with some overall weak dlc content that didn t add a ton except nuka world nuka world was good mods help fallout 4 to be a very good experience but if i mention mods i have to mention the creation club and what is more or less paid mods microtransactions with a different terminology bethesda s games have been known for having very active modding communities for a long time now and they probably will for a long time to come but bethesda also needs to acknowledge that the community at large wants nothing to do with paid mods or microtransactions in a single player game especially when the mods they offer can be obtained for free on the pc platform unfortunately the creation club is the only solution for playstation 4 users to get anything outside of what bethesda hand made which is a real shame for them despite my sympathies to ps4 users shoving paid mods down my throat wasn t the solution we or they needed modders do what they do best because they are passionate for it not because there s a pay check at the end that s what game designers are for several big modding communities and projects have set up methods for donations to get to them as well if people wanted to offer money there is always a method for it to happen despite the laundry list of issues one could propose for fallout 4 the core of the game isn t a bad one a handful of mods to fix the gamebreaking issues a few mods to make your time in boston more interesting and this is a good game but my personal opinion on it will remain as not recommended so long as this creation club fiasco is breathing down our throats thanks for taking the time to read this i hope it helped someone
