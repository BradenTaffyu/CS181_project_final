2018 great game i enjoy it and primarily played as a japanese carrier all and all a great game i can agree with some other players that maybe carriers need to be nerfed or maybe rework bits and parts of the game out of gameplay balance instead of historical accuracy the community on the other hand sucks most players don t communicate and aren t toxic and are overall decent guys but they are out weighed by the vocal minority that think that each of these battles will change the outcome of ww2 i thought league of legends was pretty salty but the oceans and all of their salt will be found in a single match i plan on quitting the game because of the community and the constant grind to get to the next ship
