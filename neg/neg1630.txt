2020 early access review pretty disappointing very underwhelming too similar to m b1 but worse gameplay wise no real improvements polishment made except for character progression hud ui graphics presentation and sounds which are pretty good and i m even ignoring all the bugs and crashes the game currently suffers it took them 8 years for this the biggest disappointment for me is sadly the combat how can they ruin the bread and butter of mount blade it is very clunky dumbed down plagued by poor hit detection and it feels like every action has a huge delay behind it this seems by the reviews of others also present in the multiplayer which i didn t play yet i m not gonna praise this game and buying into the hype despite having 2000 combined hours in mount blade 1 in steam retail and being the biggest fanboy of the franchise i normally don t write reviews and really want this game to succeed but in this current state i can t recommend this game to anyone edit removed due to change of opinion edit2 to avoid getting bombarded by the m b bannerlords defense force this review is a reflection of the current state of the game if more features and fixes being patched into the game i m happy to change this review
