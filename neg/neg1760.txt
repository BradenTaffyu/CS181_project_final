2020 great game terrible company war thunder provides a lot of game modes for people who wish to have varying levels of realism it has tanks it has aircraft it has tanks and aircraft in one mode and boats but that s the red headed step child of the game modes aircraft simulation battles appease the die hard fans of that genre while the game has an arcade mode for people who just wand to pew pew with their planes but the grind oh god the grind you d think unlocking the upgrades and vehicles would be the limiting factor you d be wrong the free currency silver lions sl is needed for normal ammo much like it s counterpart the vehicles and upgrades require this currency to purchase them once unlocked with xp but it is also used for normal ammo costs yup anything beyond the basic ammo for your tanks planes and boats costs oh and if you have the unfortunate luck to get killed in a round i mean who does that right it costs sls to have your vehicles repaired granted this also appears in war thunders competitors but where those games give you ample in game rewards to cover your costs until near the end of the tech tree here in war thunder it is entirely possible outside of the starter vehicles to lose sls on a match in ammo repair costs not at the top tier not at mid tier literally the next vehicle after the newbie vehicle sure you can wait hours to days for those vehicles to be fixed for free but that s hours or days you re not spending playing the game if those are your only vehicles and if you like simulation level play you pay half the repair costs up front just to spawn into the match this is how they balance op vehicles gaijin will sprinkle xp boosters on you like candy sl boosters good luck in the months i played the number of times i got an sl booster i could count on one hand with fingers left over oh and the best feeling is when you fire up an sl booster and get one shot in a round before you re even close to the half way point well don t be dumb and wander where the enemy might be i understand but this is where war thunder s other whammy comes into play you d think that once you re placed in a match the teams would be even you d think that there would be a reasonable time frame for people to log into the match you d be dead wrong in just the past day alone i have been placed into matches where the enemy team has one more player than my team i don t mean that someone afked or didn t load in i mean we had say 15 names in our team list to the opposing team s 16 names i ve had matches where i loaded in only to have the enemy already capping their closest capture point slow machine on my part oh no no nooooo checking the team list half my team hadn t yet loaded and the half that did load was still sitting in spawn because they just got in when i did the match literally started before we had a chance to start this means that when you load into a match you have no idea how far you can go in the map unlike other games in the genre in those games you know when the match starts you have a certain amount of the map you can move in before enemy contact is likely not so with war thunder just pray you re on the team that got to load in before the match started or you re fighting an uphill battle speaking of uphill battles the maps are terrible as well there are some maps where there s a single capture point in an open field with no cover where one team spawns on hill overlooking the capture point while the other team spawns in a flat area with no cover mechanically the game is great kudos to the dev team for that when the matches are even when the teams actually start at the same time when the map doesn t flat out suck this game represents one of the better entrants in the genre esp since it literally packs 3 games from its main competitor into one but the grind the terrible match mechanics the terrible maps it saps all will to actually play the game out from you
