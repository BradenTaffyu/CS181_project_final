2021 i have sunk hundreds of hours into this game on ps4 and i recently made the decision to play through it again on pc now i am a huge fallout fan it s one of my favourite ips of all time and my love for it will never dwindle fallout new vegas still to this day sits as one of my favourite games of all time so as you d expect when fallout 4 got announced i was pretty hyped super hyped i pre ordered it and as soon as i got my hands on it it was literally all i played for weeks and weeks and weeks and for a time it was my favourite of the series until i played new vegas for the 10th time again now as a game fallout 4 is pretty great the combat is fun the revised vats system is great the dialogue while questionable sometimes can be pretty funny the game looks nice and the world is huge however it s a bad fallout game and a bad rpg it s not even an rpg it s a shooter which would be fine had the game marketed itself as that but instead bethesda had to lie about how expansive it is and how much freedom the player has sure we can run around a huge world and kill things but that s not freedom when it comes to an rpg you can do those exact same things in any rockstar title and those games aren t rpgs the beautiful thing about fallout and rpgs in general is that it s your story you can tackle pretty much any situation any way you want don t want to fight you can talk your way out of it for example is there an annoying npc that s giving you an annoying quest shoot the guy and it doesn t harm the story want to do your current quest in an alternate way to what the game suggests an rpg allows that but fallout 4 does not you are railroaded in a linear story which ends the same no matter what you do your choices carry no weight your character isn t you there is no mystery behind your character the beautiful thing about fallout new vegas is that the game tells you that you re a courier you got shot in the head and somehow survived lost your package the platinum chip find the dude retrieve the platinum chip the rest is up to youit was simple yet effective yet here we have basically fallout 3 the alternate universe instead of it being your dad it s your son you have to find which btw without getting into spoilers it makes absolutely no logical sense come the end and it s just so cheesy and sometimes cheesy is good but not here fallout is meant to be dark and bleak and yes while it s okay to have humour and lighthearted moments the core of it needs to be miserable fallout new vegas and all the other titles pretty much had that covered but here it feels like i m playing through a generic action movie look if you re looking for a good time and don t care about the lore or characters then you ll have an absolute blast but if you re a fallout fan like myself it s a one and done sort of thing and you go back to new vegas or any other fallout title hence my hours on this title over console pc with new vegas and 3 to an extent i ve sunk 500 hours in with this game i d guess 150 at best i don t hate it but i sure as hell don t love it either edit btw the next gen update is it wasn t needed it has contributed nothing and now added more issues the game already had typical bethesda
