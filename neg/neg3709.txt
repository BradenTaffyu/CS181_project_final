early access review this game went from a fun survival base builder to a lame endless cycle of fetch quests the only way to progress through the game now is to repeat trader quests in an infinite loop for books and advanced materials it s no longer worth scavenging for these in the open world due to the scarcity and necessity of said books and the absurd quantity of them that you ll need to upgrade skills or craft anything useful in the game the trader s quest rewards are the most efficient open for resource collection by far and the only way to get the recipes for better gathering tools beyond your primitive junk anyway so it s just not worth struggling out in the open world trying to manually gather anything anymore gone are the days of doing anything to get better at it and finding a bookstore to boost a few random skills here and there now the only way to learn recipes for anything in the game is through finding books and the only viable source for those books is by repeating the same 3 trader quests over and over again the rewards for increasing reputation with each trader are also more punishing than beneficial increased time to complete higher level objectives 2 3 longer to complete each quest with generally worse rewards the fun pimps philosophy of game development has really been to stop players from doing what they were having fun with and instead of making the game better after all of these years they ve been more focused on trying to counter the player s enjoyment to the point that the game has turned into just a really crappy version of a looter shooter with some survival mechanics added in for flavor the most effective zombie base now is literally a skybox with a ramp and a window to shoot out of there s no creativity left and it s a damned shame
