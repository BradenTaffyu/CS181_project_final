2015 good game but not a good fallout game the game needs a ton of work from modders to fix an incredible amount of issues everything from the horrible ui to the terrible inventory system to the sheer lack of weapons the new voiced protagonist alone ruins a huge part of fallout games this is the fallout game you get when you make it with consoles in mind and with hopes to capture mass market sales instead of catering to your long time fans bethesda simply went too far in dumbing fallout down new vegas was an exponentially more complex and rich game save your money and more importantly wait for the mod community to fix the game
