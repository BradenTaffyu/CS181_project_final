righty disclaimer if you are in any way offended by some harsh criticism possess an inability to think critically or outside the box feel free to scroll until you find your omg amazing fun game reviews cause this won t be one of those before you think but this guy has 200 hours in this game how dares he not recommend it there is always someone who would go lolol this guy has only 7 hours in the game how could he know what a masterpiece it is now this is out of the picture let me talk about the game itself i jumped on the hype train when this came out and thats an experience i will not discuss here this is not the same f76 it used to be through ages of developement multiple patches season passes whatnot this is not an entirely bad game just not a fallout game sure it had it s botox injections and dark rituals so now this thing does look like a fallout game but tis not in case you re familiar with the world and lore of fallout this could be described as everything wrong with modern fallout adaptations turned up to eleven a looter shooter with dated mechanics broken ass builds endless grinding just so that you can have an overpowered weapon sometime in the future in let s say if you re lucky in 2 300 hours of grind this game is everything wrong with a modern gaming b the fallout ip c bethesda it plays like you have turned on wild wasteland perk and you can t ever turn it off goofy whacky stupid on some very very rare occasion satiric what fallout should be about in the first place now i know a lot of ya think fallout should be is and always was like this it wasnt modern iterations of the game namely bethesda made it like this cause they do not have a vision for their games other than take consumers money care not about said consumer once you got it s money their beliefs not mine i care about my fellow gamers hence this review game is still plagued with bugs i mean over 200 hours i ve seen at least 200 different kind of bugs from graphical glitches to lightning shadow problems to broken main quests to broken inventory management to brokent c a m p settlement management broken animations broken enemies easy to exploit easy to cheese sometimes you dont even have to do that a boss will just stand around doing nix broken weapons now as it was with me it could be fun with some friends you can have a barrel of laughs but as soon as they exit the world and you re on your own it s just the same repetitive grindfest daily quests season pass grind item farming reputation farming so that you might have access to more shiny useless sh t if farming is your stuff let me stop you right there the game s in game currency is pretty much capped daily meaning if you play too much the vendors you can sell your things for caps money currency or scrip item crafting material currency will run out of their daily limit afterwards you can t really sell your stuff junk legendary items or whatever you ve acquired usually this point comes very quickly each day if you re doing activities would like to make this short but there s still more bear with me junk and inventory management is nightmarish you have a very limited stash in your camp where you can dump your items to i m not a pack rat type of player trying to keep my things to a minimum still my stash got full in my first week or so of playing everything after this point is a game of micromanagement where you have to constantly be on the lookout and dump the useless literal tons of items material in order to be able to play the game cause once you get over encumbered you ll know what real pain is like this leads us to the final part where these mechanics i ve just described are designed for one purpose only subscirbe to fallout 1st which is as you have guessed a monthily subscription based plan this allows you to have storage for your junk and ammo items practically freeing a lot of weight up from your camp limit also gives you various bonuses but it s just not something i would pay for especially not for this shell of a company if you d like to have a fallout experience i m recommending fallout 3 or fallout new vegas not f4 as it is useless in it s current state devs made sure of that remember vote with your wallets dare to be critical don t be black tar h roin users when it comes to gaming
