2019 for me having spent a lot of time with flight simulators and some racing sims i kind of expect a product termed simulator to bring with it a certain and reasonable level of sophistication and depth ats has some elements of a sim but it comes off too much like an amusement park arcade sort of experience it can be fun at times but only in short bursts and with the proper outlay of hardware which makes it difficult to recommend but not necessarily one to take a hard pass on if you re into these kinds of titles the good stuff the graphics compared to previous trucking games from the past 10 years they re the best we ve seen lighting effects can be very nice the trucks look well modeled and textured many of the objects in the game world can look pretty good fairly large modding community as time goes on the mod list grows there are plenty of map addons available additional tractors trailers and other things which serve to enhance the game in some way the best of these seem to be supported by modders who typically stay on top of their creations updating them as needed good scaling obviously having one to one distances would be absurd and virtually nobody would be capable of sitting down and driving a few hundred miles in one shot it would take all day i think the developers have managed to provide a good representation of the real distances between cities that works in the context of the game solid vr support as well as support for wheels and shifters with a variety of options for setting it all up to your liking this is where the game really seems to shine and without these options i would not play the not so good stuff the graphics while they re pretty good as far as truck sims go they re quite bad compared to just about any other game out there that asks for this kind of money it s not just the fact that the materials and textures often look old in terms of available tech but other issues as well draw distance seems to be a problem i often see distant mountains or buildings pop into view or just sort of slide into view as the clipping plane moves dead world yes there s the ai traffic the occasional construction zone incidents and pedestrians but it s honestly not enough and the ai traffic is really basic in its behavior this is probably one of my biggest issues with the game and perhaps i m just wanting too much i understand scs very likely doesn t have a budget like rockstar did for gta 5 but it would be nice to see a bit more life breathed into the game world at least in terms of traffic behavior and some pedestrian activity i d love to see other trucks moving about at a shipper guys jockeying trailers forklifts uncoupling pre tripping etc same thing with truck stops just some more ambience and more complicated ai would go a long way lack of variety there s way too much uniformity from city to city from buildings to road layouts it s almost like once you ve been to one town you ve kind of seen them all at least within a given state unealistic roads and loading areas too many stretches of highway with no shoulder hardly any median too few lanes odd exit lanes curves that are way too tight etc many of the warehouse locations are overly restrictive in terms of space i like a good parking challenge but some places are ridiculous generally shallow gameplay frankly there s just not much to it all you hop in pick a load the gps tells you where to go then you follow the red line and get paid there are no random breakdowns or blown tires no detailed maintenance system for your rig s no real management of hired drivers and their rigs may as well be all text based no potential for inspections at a scale house no log book system no sliding tandems to adjust weights no dedicated contracts no fuel contracts etc there s so much potential here to create a deep rich game to support the driving side of things but i don t see any indication that these things will ever become reality the game is just so simplistic yet not inexpensive making it very hard to recommend you can greatly enhance it with mods but only up to a point since that stuff is mostly just cosmetic and even then it shouldn t really be a requirement a game that s asking for 45 to 50 for admission right now needs to offer a lot more and if you don t already have a wheel pedals and a shifter you re going to really break the bank trying to get something out of this title you can play with a gamepad or even a keyboard and mouse but this isn t really how the game was designed to be played if you re set up with that stuff already and really itching to drive a virtual truck then maybe give it a shot but otherwise i don t think it s worthwhile i will continue to play it of course
