2021 extremely disappointed with the news that the game s support is already over this game had so much potential but as of right now it is completely unfinished and still has major issues knowing that these issues will never be fixed means i just can t recommend this game and i don t even know if i will ever want to play it again the worst thing is all of this happened for a bloody sequel that is years away and we do not even know if it will deserve being called a sequel this could become a new low for total war and i hate it
