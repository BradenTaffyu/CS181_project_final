2015 this game has practically zero steam integration you need to register a separate account for the game and launch it through your web browser beyond the rookie league which you need to get out of in order to enjoy the game all cars cost money and all tracks cost money and you need to buy at least 1 car and probably around 5 8 tracks racking up a cool 100 in addition to the subscription fees if you re ok with all of this though the online racing experience is the best you can get the graphics however are surpassed in most areas by other games though iracing has a lot of great trackside detail others lack and the physics are weird the game updates its physics quite often but not across all cars at the same time so some cars behave better than others during loss of grip the feedback in this game is quite poor so it s more difficult to counter than other games i had to use real world scale fov and headtracking in order to improve this if you really want a super hardcore online racing simulator i do recommend iracing but not through steam if you want better graphics just as good if not better physics and laser scanning but a bit worse online i highly recommend getting assetto corsa instead which will also save you a lot of money
