2017 if you like nature and hunting this is the game to get no game on the market nails down the atmosphere like this one does in my objective opinion it has the best looking nature environment i have ever seen in a game the playermodels do feel a bit more cartoonish caution if you are a run and gun type of player this has little to offer you also seeing the relative scarcity of animals you will be walking alot like alot i personally dont mind because i get immersed into the scenery and audio hiking simulator xd if you play it smart aka dont keep running everywhere and scare all the animals away you can stalk or lure animals pretty fast just keep in mind to make your first shot count this is no zombie shooter game try going for the lungs at the beginning then gradually learn to hit more smaller vital spots this is for the noobs who would stalk an animal for 30m then miss the shot because they went for a headshot then ragequit and refund at launch there were some problems with animal ai they kept getting stuck in trees and bushes and some ui problems these have been fixed and many other things however some smaller bugs remain to be honest i dont like the quests some are even ridiculously hard like making a valid photograph of 3 bears in a certain zone the business model however is deceitful unlike their previous titel thehunter that has microtransactions for every little piece of content thehunter call of the wild was advertised as an one time purchase ok no problem even though i knew they would add new reservations as dlc currently 2 ingame acceptabelnope they added some basic stuff that should have been in the core game as free dlc and started pushing some core game mechanics as paid dlc custom spawn fasttravel points tents and motorized transport atv conclusion transport and cutom spawn fasttravel points as dlc whats the next step in the game development world selling the ability to save a game as dlc yep lets chop the whole game into dlc the ability to run the ability to reload the ability to harvest an animal all dlci like this game really but i currently cant support the business model of the developers once they start selling actual extra content as dlc and setting the core mechanics they are currently selling to free i will give this a upvote
