2020 i have played civilization games for over 10 years but after two expansions and 329 hours on civilization vi i ve found that i can t recommend it to new or familiar players of civilization the primary reason for this has to do with the diplomacy functions they have become nonsensical and frustrating to deal with i don t play this game to be frustrated i play to be challenged and to express creativity but the absurd ai actions around diplomacy have come to make this very difficult examples of this include 1 surprise wars with no diplomatic repercussions either once or repeatedly by the same characters 2 nonsensical peace options such as taking a city from a player that has declared a surprise war on you and then becoming the target of an emergency how does this make sense 3 random denunciations with very little contact with the character this one really breaks reason 4 denunciations or demands from characters centuries after the last peace deal complaints that a former city of theirs is occupied when it was the transfer was agreed upon in a peace deal 5 very little relationship building character relationships often feel predestined from the start 6 overall character relationships feel childish and stagnant this is certainly not representative of any real diplomacy and while i understand this is a game is it not trying to replicate parts of reality i m sure there are others that i m currently not able to think of now none of this is to say that the history of war and diplomacy has been full of reason and rationality however one is typically able to see quite simply the connections between 1 one s desire for war and 2 the declaration of war itself in other words one s desire and the action to seize this desire this is not the case in civilization vi i recommend reading machiavelli s the prince and overhauling the ai accordingly until then i ll be sticking to europa universalis iv
