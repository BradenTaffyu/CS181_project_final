a really fun card game marred by disgusting monetization play for free if you plan on sticking with it long term playing daily or just skip it entirely there really isn t a good middle ground the game lacks any form of decent catch up mechanics and the value you get per dollar is abysmal i m cl 22 000 and i ve been playing daily since the games global launch i won t fault any game for charging for cosmetics but all too frequently awesome artists works are locked behind time limited one and done bundles that require you to buy 50 100 worth of currencies you might not want or worse behind spending 200 total in a month which now only counts purchases made through the webshop players who take a break will struggle to catch up with their collection as you re at the whim of which cards they decide to run in spotlight caches some haven t re appeared for more than a year and your only other option is to spend extremely rare tokens to get them the best way to acquire those tokens is to buy them for cash often in fomo bundles or 2 000 tokens 4 6k required per card are awarded for every 10 variants you buy which cost between 700 and 2400 gold or 10 to 30 usd each unless you get a better rate buying a bundle which aren t always available they ve repeatedly made promises about features that encourage people to spend their resources only to cancel them entirely like first edition badges which were to encourage people to buy new cards when they released only to go silent on them and move on to other systems like spotlight caches or the character mastery system which promised a character specific reward track for collecting cosmetics on your favourite cards despite showing pictures of the system describing how it would work and claiming it was coming soon for half a year it was cancelled in the footnotes of an update citing technical difficulties in a very tone deaf emoji filled send off their replacement has been character albums piggybacking off a system that already existed and rather than counting for any character only the ones they want to promote which so far seems like 2 additional characters per month wolverine and soon deadpool for july to coincide with the new movie as they release 4 or more new characters in the same time span albums were supposed to be rewarding for people who like collecting variants of a certain theme or artist and to encourage more people to collect but most new albums are not made up of variants already sold in the game they often release more than half an albums counted variants when they add the album to encourage new spending the latest deadpool s diner event is just another example of rampant monetization with many players who lost their first round being locked out of the mode on a timer with a message asking them for 700 gold to keep playing which costs as much as the monthly battle pass to buy outside of bundles for a handful of event limited tokens called bubs which are used to gamble on match outcomes you don t need to buy them to progress the event you actually start earning them by the thousands and eventually millions over the course of several matches depending on how often you win but they seem to think its fair to charge people who are unfamiliar with the mode almost 1 1 bubs per gold which is an insultingly low value you can earn that many in 3 games at the start but they will lock you out if you made the mistake of going all in the mode itself is basically a re skin of their only other mode outside of ranked play called conquest i ve defended their practices in the past as they ve been pretty good about making changes in accordance to feedback but this pattern of money above all else is really wearing me thin every company wants to turn a profit but when you manipulate your players at every turn to do so it just becomes inexcusable you cannot trust anything they sell is a good value you have to know the systems inside and out and that s a problem it has reached the point where i feel this game does not appropriately value your time or your money and for that reason i cannot recommend it to anyone despite the game play itself being really good
