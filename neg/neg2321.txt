2018 this is decent game if you buy it you may well enjoy it as i have there are areas of the game that could be improved but overall it is solid i definately recommend you have a steering wheel setup here is my complaint and the primary reason for the down vote the game is too expensive for what you get if you want to drive in 4 of the 48 continental states you would pay 44 not so bad game 20 dlc 24 a bit steep imo but maybe worth it here is my problem paying 12 for each state is way too much you will have paid about 572 to drive in all 48 with the current dlc system i don t doubt that they would combine some states i am certainly not paying 12 for rhode island no offense rhode island but your really small they don t seem to be combining them now thank goodness they didn t decide to do the dlc by city imagine what they might have charged then
