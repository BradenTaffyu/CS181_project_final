2014 i hate to play the same tune as so many others but unlike them i am taking my review and going a step further i m a lover of history from as ancient as mayan and aztec cultures to as modern as it can get when talking current news i love to know why things happened the reasons the causes the impacts upon how we see things today and what it can mean for those who care to enjoy their history so as i write this review keep the words historical accurate and fair in mind cause they ll be mentioned a lot historical planes tanks and ships all clashing upon one battlefield that allows players to simultaneous and fairly enjoy how these various war machines of history would have performed under the accurate scrutiny of gaijin s developers who no doubt have the best interest of this game at heart right but what game are we playing if not war thunder a game advertised as historically accurate and fair to all countries in how they are represented historically to players knowing they re targetting both a large audience who wants a fun combat flight simulator game which boasts accuracy and simultaneously knowing they re targetting the history buffs and adamant learners who want to gleefully roar through the skies as a p 47 thunderbolt over 1940 s germany surely they would want to represent the lives lost the battles won and the ingenuity of men and women of this war accurately right now take every mention of those words i told you to notice before and answer them with no this game was praised as the champion against other games like world of tanks where world of tanks and it s corporate model is to force all players into mediocrity and a 50 win loss range than to be fair look up greedy goblin s world of tanks article then you will agree even i came in when war thunder had almost one quarter the number of planes is has now and was boasted as being historically accurate those days are long gone i ve put in well over 300 hours of my life trying to enjoy this game the only times i authentically enjoyed this game is when i broke down and submitted to the mentality of my close friends who call this game by it s true name glorious soviet union comrade victory simulator by this i mean i started playing nothing but soviet russian planes i watched in initial glee as my scores skyrocketted i went from being the bottom 5 players to the top 5 then the horror hit me i was indoctrinated i had spent cash to turn around from the planes i wanted to desperately enjoy yet i can t due to the gsucvs and it s portrayal of russian warplanes as nigh unstoppable machines of complete devestation i spent cash to enjoy the best of the united states circa 1940 s era planes i always wanted to fly i spent cash and time to work up the german luftwaffe planes where i finally hit my peak into indoctrination that is when i spent cash to play soviet russian planes like everyone else just so my above average flight skills aren t being held back because a single russian plane can endure over 1000 rounds of 50 caliber anti air machinegun fire so my enjoyment and money spent on my dud planes with other factions was turned around and then i learned the glory of the gsucvs it s taken me some time it really has but i can finally say without the shadow of any doubt this game as made for russians by russians and most likely at gunpoint by joseph stalin himself or at least by the specter of stalin the only hope to redeem this game would be to overhaul it cut out the busywork of all the prototype and testbed planes that keep you from enjoying the plane you really want cut out the horribly overpowered and unbalaned and unfair russian cheat engine for russian planes and lasty to apologize to every player for their grievous wounds inflicted upon trying to represent accurate history until then i will not recommend this game unless you understand that it is not an accurate game that it is a game made to pander towards old soviet diehards who can t see mother russia as anything but completely indomitable and constantly producing instant win scenarios play it but do not spend your cash play it but do not bother commenting on their eu usa forums they will simply mock you with sock puppets while they ban your forum account
