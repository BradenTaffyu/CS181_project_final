2022 a good shooter but a terrible rpg if you re looking to buy this game because you loved the world that fallout 1 2 tactics and new vegas provided then its best to steer clear of this one and look for a fan project instead i think that you can find out all you need to about this game and its priorities when you realize that you only have a maximum of 4 dialouge choices for any given conversation which boil down mostly to question mean sarcastic or nice and a fully fleshed out weapon modification system complete with a weapons range accuracy and fire rate included right on a little flashy menu ive been told that after fallout 3 bethesda brought on some people from id software to help them with their shooting mechanics and it shows because in its own right that s the best part about fallout 4 overall is just the shooting the melee is also there but in comparison to the myrriad of guns you find it can get somewhat overshadowed the combat in fallout 4 along with all the chems and other acsessories to murder you can find or make really does make this game shine and the junk components system along with the settlements and workshop crafting you can do really can make this game an enjoyable and rewarding experience ive spent irl days carefully scavengeing and crafting to make my favorite settlements as homey and practical as possible and does give me a sense of pride and accomplishment however the games weakest point is just about everything outside of the barrel of your gun similar to fallout 3 you are forced to pick a faction to end the game and no matter which side you pick it all just boils down to weather you get to blow someplace up or not the whole world and even the dlc s are just barely half baked enought that they allmost seem sensical if you ve grown accustomed to not questioning or not careing about how or if any of the things in this world would actually work in real life and if any of it makes any sense beyond plot convience looking at it from its surface the quests and side quests seem good enought as is easy to digest wraps up nicely enought and dosent go down without a hassle but peeling back the skin and looking into the bones of it all this game is very much designed for a player instead of just existing on its own right and haveing the player be there to experiance it its allmost impossible to fail any quest you re always drip fed a good amount of loot and goodies to sell or obsess over morality for your actions are reduced to weather your companions agree with it or not and the junk system acts as a reliable way to make sure that all players becuase you cant complete the game without settlements even if you wanted to can always leave a location or encounter with enought satisfaction to make you want to start the skinner box all over again and thats my main problem with this game even after playing allmost 300 hours and going throught all the effort to 100 it legitimately there are a lot of welly polished aspects of this game that are very pleasureable to play and if youre looking for a looter shooter with a lot of customization this game is an excellent choice for that but everything outside clicking at the bad people to make them go die is just so lackluster that its hard to say there was ever a molment in this game where i felt immersed or that i was playing a role and when its hard to really feel like you re playing a charecter in a game advertised as a rpg its just dissapointing to say the least the last thing i will add as a positive for the game that i do prominently belive makes it worth at least some money not 60 worth is its very acsessible modding system youtubers like juicehead and mikeburnfire build a lot of their content on showing how you can use the mods that fans have made for this game to transform it into entirely diffrent genres and experiances and i belive that speaks a lot about how this game can have a lot of upsides i didnt call it a skinner box for nothing modding allows you to experiance so many things within the game weather it be fully voice acted questlines or new guns fine tuned to perfection but sadly at the end of the day no matter how many mods you install or creation club items you buy something i dont have time to touch up upon but i look at it with distain you ll still have to deal with the same sidequests the same story and the same half baked world its just this time you ve slapped a new coat of paint on top of it overall would i reccomend this game if the review hasent made it obvious no i really wouldnt i wouldnt reccomend it to you if you wanted a good story or welly thought out charecters i wouldnt reccomend it if you wanted an immersive world that feels alive in any way other than for your convinecne and entertainment i would reccomend it only if you were looking for a good shooting game or if you were looking for a game to install as many nsfw mods as possible until your cpu melts and honestly when a frightening amount of the games best content not talking about the nsfw mods are actually fan creations what is the game itself anymore if not just a slate to etch modlists on 4 10
