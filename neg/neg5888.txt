2020 i like this game i really do as far as gameplay is concerned the game is awesome i can not however recommend purchasing this game as it is riddled with microtransactions the monkey money system allows the player to unlock numerous items throughout the game like traps and heroes monkey money can be unlocked via challenge completing and you guessed it microtransactions it didn t bother me too much as you can still acquire monkey money relatively easily through the game the last time i loaded the game march 15th 2020 the skill system in the game based on knowledge points has now implemented a monkey money requirement that s about as much as i m willing to support knowledge points are collected through leveling up which left it as one of the few aspects in the game that couldn t be influenced by pay to win means with the change a knowledge point is required in addition to a payment of monkey money this dramatically reduces the progress a player can make in the skill tree in order to encourage players to give in to the mt scheme it s frankly just a greedy and ugly move on part of ninja kiwi especially considering they charge 10 for this game if this greedy practice gets pulled back by the developers i will change my rating as of now i can not in good conscience recommend btd6
