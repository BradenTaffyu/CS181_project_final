2015 this game in not the game fallout fans deserve now there is even less choice than in skyrim the world is filled with not interesting dull characters the dialogue system is a joke the perk system in a joke it just doesn t feel exciting at all after playing fallout 3 and fallout new vegas which is my favourite game by the way for the first 12 hours of gameplay i have never made a real choice after that it got a little better but just a little the main story is ok but but side quests are horrible i don t think it is the right direction for bethesda to develop their games i just feel they can do so uch more in my opinion we shouldn t tolerate this because if we do we will recieve something even worse next time i find weapon customisation nice but it doesn t complement the missing choice and quests and dialogues etc
