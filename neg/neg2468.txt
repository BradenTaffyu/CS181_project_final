the time monetary investment to get a functional deck is quite a bit but lets say you have the time or money are you excited to play with hundreds of different decks sorry you have like 8 10 reasonable options if you want a fun game mind you 1 4 of your deck is determined by what hand traps you need i have a lot of love for yugioh and card games in general but i feel like this game for a while now has been struggling with the ability to let players interact what i mean is i have fun when the game doesn t feel decided when it s a struggle but most of these cards say no you don t do anything that just isn t fun for the other 50 of the matches losing can be fun if you felt like you had a chance this game is really good at laying it out on the table how little chance you had how much can be decided by coin flip good card games obscure this reality or try to balance it so that there are comebacks this game doesn t care about gameplay it cares about solitaire like combos comments are open so the true fans or hardcores can tell me how i m wrong
