2016 it s a great game it s just not a great fallout game while the combat animation graphics as well as many other aspects of this game are spot on and are what we ve wanted from fallout for a while but on the other hand there is a serious lack of a fallout feel to this game almost literally everything you come across you are supposed to kill there are no npc settlements other than diamond city which is lacklustre at best this game feels like a completely seperate game to the fallout series fallout to me has always been about meeting people in the game and finding out what their deal is gone are those days with 4 see something shoot it simple as that there is nothing else to do the perk system is pretty pointless and almost all of them are useless i could go on but i won t i ll simply wrap it up with this instead of filling the game with characters that you feel connections with and decent miscellanious quests they hope that you re too busy building settlements and helping out preston with the never ending raiders to actually flesh the game out with content while i enjoyed the game i got bored before i even finished the main story as there is literally nothing else worth doing this is a pathetic excuse of a fallout it s literally worse than 3
