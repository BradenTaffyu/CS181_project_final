2018 early access review i absolutely loved this game once after a17e theres no way i could recommend this game anymore the new perk system is terrible you want to mine quicker barely quicker kill more zombies to level up and buy the perk you want to cook different food kill more zombies to level up and buy the perk you want to make some awesome tools that work faster kill more zombies and oh wait all the tools are pretty much the same damage now just go kill more zombies anyway level 20 unlocks the forge and level 100 unlocks the highest tier of each attribute perk so its basically a zombie grind to 20 and then 100 the fun of looting is totally gone as theres no better tools weapons schematics to find its all locked up behind perks i really don t understand why this perk system was added the old one wasn t perfect but it was so much better and could have been improved upon people say they still need to tweak the new one i fail to see how they can tweak it to be better you should be able to make everything from day one apart from maybe some stuff that require schematics just having the resources materials should be the blocker not a boring tedious perk system there is absolutely no depth whatsoever with this system you will eventually get every single perk quite easily if you focus on killing zombies the game was better when there was no perk system i usually play each update till i m bored of it then wait for the next this time i won t be playing again unless this system is removed or modded into something that has more depth feature wise jack of all master of none comes to mind
