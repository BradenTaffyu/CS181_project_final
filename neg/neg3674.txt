2015 early access review as someone who has put some hours to this game and was is running a high pop server i cannot recommend this game it has changed a lot since the video on steam there s a new graphic engine and the ui was changed a bit wich was a nice thing what kills this game is constant bugs lack of decent marketing bad br as many before me wrote you can t post a negative feedback on forums because you ll get swarmed with fanboys telling you re a whiner or insulting you the patches are developed very slowly the content in this game almost didnt change since over 6 months latest patch was supposed to bring something everyone were waiting for weather engine driveable minibike new animal and new random generation engine the weather engine is not like it was announced to be it s simple texture change it changed brightness darkness so much most people are unable to see anything the minibike that everyone were waiting for is broken and buggy if it does work it falls under the map yeah that s the kind of endgame item you get here i won t even mention adding 1 animal to the game the random gen 3 0 is the only thing nice about the newest patch rest is just game breaking saying that there s also the coop aspect high population servers over 10 are not supported because devs claim that is game is not designed for this even that there s a need for them there s only one developer that works his ass off about the needs and makes server optimizations in 2015 there s a game like this with endless world designed for 8 players really the only good aspect of the game that i see is that i ve met enormous amount of good people in here and my server community is great if it weren t for the people i would instantly uninstall this crap so much waiting and we get so little i do not recommend this at least in it s current state try it somehwere in 3 5 years because with this speed of developing its gonna take them so much to reach beta phase
