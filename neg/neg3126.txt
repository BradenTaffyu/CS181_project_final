2021 this is a really fun game and there are no real competitors to it in terms of real time pvp ww2 naval combat however the grind is ridiculous it takes dozens and dozens of hours to grind up to the highest tier for each specific line of ships and recently every update pushed out by the developers just makes the game worse ive never played a game where updates so consistently make the game less fun to play this game is going in the wrong direction and the devs dont really care as long as long as theyre still profiting off it
