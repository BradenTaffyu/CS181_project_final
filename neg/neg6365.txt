i m going to start off by giving dave the diver the praise it deserves this game is nothing if not charming there is so much character to almost every aspect of the world and it just radiates joy the visuals are a beautiful blend of pixel graphics and low poly 3d that on many occasions left me in awe the story is fun and lighthearted and it constantly encourages you to push on and explore more of the game world there is a pretty large variety of things to do and the game introduces new mechanics all the way up until the end which helps to keep things feel fresh to an extent which brings me to why i in good conscience just can t recommend dave the diver to anyone it s simply too long and paced in such a way that some aspects of the game start to feel like chores instead of relaxing fun in my opinion it overstays its welcome by something like 2 30 hours and while there is a lot of variety the core gameplay of actually fishing diving isn t strong enough to carry the rest of the game on its shoulders it sells itself as a game where you dive during the day and manage a restaurant during the night but that balance is so heavily skewed towards diving that only 5 minutes out of every hour is spent actually managing the sushi shack and by the time you get to the deeper parts of the sea you re going to spend a lot of time retreading the same maps over and over and over again which brings me to the second part that was a letdown for me the broken promise made at the start of the game the blue hole is a changing place that mutates and shifts every time you dive into it sure but the blue hole is a very shallow part of the over 600 meter deep map adding to the frustration you will almost always want to fish in the deepest waters possible which means that you re going to spend a big chunk of your time pacing through the same oppressive dark corridors of the depths desperately trying to find rare spawning fishes so that you can progress your cooksta rating disappointingly enough once you manage to get past the depths and reach the two last levels of the sea you ll quickly realize that they are the least interesting maps in the game both sporting a very limited variety of fishes and uninteresting geometry to navigate for what it s worth they re really pretty as i mentioned before furthermore holy mackerel this whole game feels like an extended underwater level and i mean yeah sure it s a game about diving but why does everything feel so sluggish there is a notable delay between clicking the right mouse button and pulling up your harpoon aim which makes it so that you often use a melee attack when you wanted to fire off a shot this doesn t sound like a big issue but since there is a big focus on fighting bosses that are very much faster than you and i m counting every shark as a mini boss to that list you end up in scenarios where you have a fraction of a second to attack before you need to start dodging their attacks again you could lessen this problem by using firearms with better range but the game very clearly tells you that you shouldn t use them since you get fewer rewards from dead fish this leads you to rely on random drops from randomly spawning weapon chests to get just the right harpoon tip that has either a slowing effect so you can actually fight the sharks or a sleep effect once you unlock the yellow submarine upgrade roughly 15 20 hours into the game and it s arguably pretty underwhelming until you get the 2x and 3x upgrades for it there s another point i could make about how your oxygen tank is both your health bar and sprint meter but this review is long enough as it is and i don t want to rant forever and go on another tangent this sluggishness extends to every other aspect of the play experience as well dave moves like a mollusk both on land and in the water which makes mundane things like talking to bancho at the end of the restaurant or emptying the fish farm needlessly time consuming tasks when you pour tea and other drinks at the restaurant there is a long pause between every action so you feel like you re wasting a lot time just waiting to regain control of your character so you can service the other patrons even just confirming a choice by holding a button takes a few beats longer than it has to i think even the devs are aware of this i ve gone back to watch the trailer i can see that almost every single gameplay clip in it is sped up a bit not a great look to be honest another small issue that made itself evident throughout the game is just how many quick time events there are on a conceptual level i take no issue with qte s but it feels a bit thematically dissonant to slowly paddle your way through almost all of the game only for it to be undercut by having to furiously mash the space bar as fast as possible for an extended amount of time and lastly the game holds your hand way too much there are fun little puzzles throughout the levels i think i would have really appreciated it if the game didn t go into a cut scene while explicitly telling me the solution to the problems before i even get a chance to explore what s going on it s a small nitpick but it s a cherry on top of an experience that at its core is pretty descent but undercuts itself by committing to a lot of annoying choices out of the two fishing related games i bought as a part of this bundle i can with confidence say that dredge is the stronger experience it doesn t offer nearly as much in terms of gameplay but when i walk away from that game i was hungry for more whereas with dave the diver i felt exhausted and just happy that it was over
