2022 performance on amd hardware is very inconsistent the game will be running 60 fps in one second and then the most minor in scene changes and it chugs down to 35 fps i kind of just took it on the chin for a while but decided to put my playthrough on hold until a patch resolving this issue was released the game devs say they have found the problem but that was a month ago and there hasn t been any communication as far as their progress god of war really is a special game and i m still happy i purchased it just really wishing they could figure out this problem
