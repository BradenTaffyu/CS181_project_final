2022 master duel has everything that would make it one of the best places to play ygo it s easy it s fast relatively it s visually good with a mostly cohesive ui building decks and finding games is incredibly simple and i enjoy being able to boot it up during downtime and hitting a quick match it s a shame that every single match is god forsaken awful i understand what their approach to the banlist has been more leniency with certain historically broken cards to allow those archetypes to have their spotlight on a wide online platform which means every game becomes a sort of pleasant mixed bag where you can never fully plan for what you ll find on the other side but because the format is a best of one where fundamentally broken cards like maxx c protos eva colossus scythe the list goes on and on decks end up going into one of two fundamental camps decks that can ftk you or decks that can stun you this ultimately means that no matter what decks are available the top cuts are always going to be a predictable mess of win turn 1 strategies the boss monsters and win conditions are almost all the same the only difference is how they reach that end board we re more or less permanently stuck in the exact same environment as the adamancipator eldlich era because konami refuses to remove decks that can abuse the best of 1 format to its maximum yes obviously there are ways to out floodgate boards and ways to break mass negate and handtraps to out ftk but it s borderline impossible to play a deck that can run all 3 and still have a game plan that won t lose to a numeron or accesscode talker otk on turn 2 this is exactly why the sideboard is invaluable and until master duel does something to acknowledge the fundamental issue this game will never be anything more than a go second concede tl dr it s a 5 10 best coinflip simulator on the market
