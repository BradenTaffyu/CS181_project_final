2023 awful ai so bad it ruins the game their idea of increased difficulty is a handicap e g throwing a ton of production culture science etc at the wall and not increasing the actual ai difficulty at all your options are to play the game at low difficulty the way it was meant to be played except it s too boring and easy or play at high difficulty and play an entirely different and worse experience that amounts to an extremely process oriented railroad down a defensive line for 10 hours until you manage to snowball using exploitative strategies this might be fun if you have asd genuinely but for me it s an absolute waste of time i could spend playing cheaper more intelligently designed games i ve tried so hard to make it fun but am disappointed every time i m uninstalling not looking back and will not be buying civ 7 if it doesn t update the ai that s straight out of the 90s it would be so easy to fix especially in this era of gaming but what do they do instead new civs new civs new civs money grab trash development all around keep reading you ll see all the negative reviews surround the ai if you re familiar with grand strategy 4k games do not buy this
