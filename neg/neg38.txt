2016 i have tried playing this game before when it first came out and i didn t understand it so i really disliked it now that 1 1 has come out i decided to give it another go about 50 hours later i have mixed feeling and really wish i didn t for a game made by a single person or a small group of people it is inspiring it is well made and shows that this is a project crafted in love that said it has this feeling of a void that cannot be filled something is missing from this game and i am not sure what that thing is is it the lack of end game progression or meaningful skills is it the constant grind or the push to be more efficient all the time i am not sure stardew valley lands in this place of trying to tell a story without forcing it on the player which sounds great on paper but it just falls short in my opinion the connection to the towns people is superficial and my immersion to the game as this city folk turned farmer broke as the game went further and further into the late game the townspeople felt less like friendly faces i want to get to know and more like obstacles i just disliked the people and the temptation to just get the jojo mart to demolish the community center became more and more appealing and after finding out what the ending is for the major storyline i said to myself is that it while the game can be played forever the main story arch falls flat and i feel no meaningful connection to it for the amount of effort and time put into the game i just don t personally feel a sense of accomplishment only one character in the game seems to achieve somethings and its not you its some other character this feeling is made even worse with the lack of a personal connection made to the towns people i really could care less and even after 50 hours of putting into the title i am going to stop playing the game for right now i would say i enjoyed the early game the most the mystery of the game but hated the story line the connection to the townspeople and the late game grind and lack of meaningful skills or items i guess i answered my earlier question i am going to rate this as a negative review solely because a mixed review gets lost in the sea of the overwhelmingly positive reviews in my opinion i think this game is highly overrated but that does not mean its a horrible game or a bad game i think it has the potential to be a good game but for right now i think its just an okay game it has a great initial experience but as the game progress it gets worse and worse
