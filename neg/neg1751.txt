2022 don t touch this war thunder is the most addictive yet toxic game i haver ever played only reason anyone plays this is because this is because there is no other game like it ofcourse there is world of planes tanks ships but none of them have the realism theme that wt has you play and get hooked with how good the planes look and it s pretty easy in the start with you being able to get a new vehicle every 10 20 30 matches and upgrades every 2nd match but then you get to 4 0 and then the grind hits you need to play for hours every day just to make any progress or keep up with one tech tree not mentioning 1 or 2 which is when people just pay for premium accounts and new vehicles i mean we get it you have to put food on the table but this this is just greed if you want to ever see jets you re going to have to pay if you want to finish a single tech tree without paying play for 6 8 hours every day for years and you might get to cold war era tech eventualy you get bored and leave but then find nothing else like wt and eventually come crawling back to this psycho abusive girlfriend of a game if there was ever a single company that would announce a game with the same concept and didn t abuse it s playerbase and listend to them even for one time it would take about 2 weeks for everyone to forget this game edit gaijin was so greedy that they tried to make playing so hard that even premium was painful and when the playerbase reacted negatively gaijin told the playerbase to themselfs and made steam hide more than 80 thousand negative rewiews a company where grown up adults work got so butthurt about what people think that they faked the rewiews bravo gaijin makes joseph goebbels look like a saint
