2020 i used to love this game when it was originally released and i kept thinking every update made the game better however the developers have gone about 30 updates too far this game is no longer fun its tedious this game is no longer complicated enough to make it interesting now it s overly complex and insanely difficult even for a multi year 300 hours sunk in to this game player like myself i do not understand this game anymore and i don t even recognize this as the stellaris i fell in love with back when it first came out
