2016 im going to start off by saying this is a review of the games pvp pve aspect and the feedback the community has gotten from fromsoft if you are only playing this game for the story and are not interested in any of the semantics than i whole heartedly recommend this game to you going to start off with a series of pros and cons pros gameplay is very fast paced and fluid i have never had a problem with my movement being stunted or interrupted at all weapons are very diverse and there are alot of choices this time around albeit a bit less than dark souls 2 every weapon has a very satisfying moveset that really feels like the hits impact and connect enemies are very memorable and so is every bossfight the levels are very diverse and the final boss was the best boss i have probably ever fought in a videogame now here comes the cons cons incredibly vague patch notes that literally say nothing in terms of information ie performance adjustment for greatsword what did you adjust magic requires a huge stat investment to even consider being viable im talking 40 60 int faith to even start doing any type of damage and even then the spell farron dart doesnt even 1 shot the starting enemies it takes two and not to mention that anyone with half a brain can dodge a spell in pvp straightswords are literally the best weapons in the game there is no point in even using anything else because anything other than a rapier or a straightsword is a complete waste of time and effort because unless you are incredibly consistent at parrying you will always get r1 spammed down invasions are also a complete waste of time considering that estus is virtually unpunishable unless you keep constant pressure the host has 30 more hp and twice the estus flasks and literally infinite phantoms coop players to summon and just wittle you down until you finally die and at that point if you do somehow manage to kill all of them the host will just disconnect not to mention that you can t even use the games enemies to your advantage because seeds of a giant tree items that turn enemies hostile to invaders they normally are not are so easy to get poise is completely non existant allowing someone who is wearing a greatshield and the heaviest armor in the game to get staggered by an enemy with a dagger when fromsoft was asked about this all they had to say was the poise stat is working as intended and is not turned off as some fans have theorized a spokesperson for bandai namco told me the stat works differently than in past games and is more situational which seems to be the reason for the confusion even though the stat is literally disabled in the games code straightswords have literally twice the hitbox than the visual length and can hit you from what seems like 10 feet away when they are clearly swinging at the air and no im not talking about phantom range im literally talking about the hitbox outranging even some ultra greatswords in length in short fix your game fromsoft
