2019 early access review i m really split on this recommendation i put 9 hours in with one of my kids 10 who s also a pc gamer in those 9 hours we have just about caught and built everything one can in the game devs are way to slow and really look more like they abandoned the game but occasionally post an announcement with some art to try to solicit new purchases hey they got me i ve watched this game since aug sept and saw posts then none of those came into the game they posted dec 7 obviously hoping for some christmas sales with the lure of see what we re about to add buy it now then they ve done nothing jan 21 now oh they occasionally pop on and respond to negative review prob will to this one too which appears more of a keep sales hope alive is this game worth it that s the bottom line i do simple math with my kids on this stuff cost of game divided by hours of play 20 for about 10 hours 2 hr i d say no i tell my kids your goal in any game is that it cost you about 1 an hour you all can make your own call on that ark survival evolved cost me about 100 time i bought all the dlcs etc i have 4600 hours in it that s about 4 6 cents an hour it was worth it red dead redemption 2 on xbox cost my son 60 the campaign story was written to take about 60 hours 1 hr totally worth it and cost isn t everything how much one enjoyed the game matters so that can factor in with raft i am left with the monotony lack of choices in building crafting taming exploring all of it scarcity of materials and in the end it s not getting any bonus for fun if i weren t playing with someone else my 10 year old in the open world format it certainly would have been even less fun so i must give this a thumbs down devs seriously post the updates you keep saying you re going to then maybe maybe this game will turn around stop trolling posts just to drum up sales with no plans to edit the game and folks seriously one only needs to look at the game package to understand that what i m saying is likely the case the game is a whopping 350mb to download think about it and it s content heck the first draft of ark was 4gb and it s now around 40 60gb the game clearly was made and launched minimalistically and don t give me that early access hate we all know some devs drop trash on here market well and take our cash with no more effort into their games sad but it happens all under the oh hey guys this is early access next year
