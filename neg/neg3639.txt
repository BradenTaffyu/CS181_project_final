2021 early access review to be clear in the 8 years its been in early access i ve played the game on and off a few times and had fun with it but i can t condone the games state any longer the game doesn t look nearly as good as 75 of the screenshots it has in the store page there have been updates in the 8 years of early access but thats been 8 years of an alpha build aside from the lvling skills and the doubling down on the 7 days to die zombie horde attacks almost nothing has been changed from the early access alpha game i bought 8 years ago if tfp ever get their together and release a beta or even a finished product i ll revisit and probably change my review oh did i mention the game has been in early access for over 8 years now
