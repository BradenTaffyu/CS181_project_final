early access review this game is an all time favorite of mine but the new spawning system in a21 is truly awful it s managed to remove all the fun i ve had in this game and rendered it completely unsatisfying to play the devs are very my way or the highway in their attitude towards the desired play style if you don t navigate pois the correct way then expect quests and zombie spawning to just never work really strange choice for a game with a completely destructible environment to punish the player for being clever and using that destructible environment
