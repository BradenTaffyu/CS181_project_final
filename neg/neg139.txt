2016 early access review original review from 8 2016 deleted so i can give everyone my updated opinion on the state of this game steam has a limit on the amount of text i can put in the review so my older text will be deleted first edit 8 3 24been updating my review ever year or two i see the devs got their heads up their butts as usual now they are working on crafting kilns or something maybe a pottery mechanic next will be a flea market where we can sell our pottery to the zombies we must sell to the zombies because again no npc s to sell them to i m spending my time playing survivalist invisible strain great game with npc s got probably 1 000 into it you should check it out instead of wasting your time on this clunky mess 10 29 23still no npc s but now they are working on basements sky scrapers and mice it s like they try to figure something to work on that isn t too difficult to implement which might appease their customers what would appease me working npc s like they had in the game years ago and promised to implement again after they went through their milestones i can t even talk about that in their forum because i ll get banned for mentioning npc s what a bunch of children 8 2 23 still no npc s but hey i got banned by one of the development team members who also moonlights as a moderator for a few weeks in their steam forum for merely asking when npc s will be introduced i hear they are working on a fishing mechanic now would not be suprised if there was an amazing new feature that the car you spent fixing would break if you didn t check and change your oil every 5 000 miles you have to track that in a notepad not included in the base game but available as a paid dlc on a brighter note i recommend that everyone check out and buy survivalist invisible strain on steam been putting hundreds of hours into that game ai and features run circles around zomboid for a fraction of the price i might add this game is being developed by one guy named bob bob is awesome he listens to his customers and puts in features that they ask for he also regularly updates and improves on the game check the update history and see for yourself 6 28 21still no npcs you know they had npc s when the game was in beta and then they disappeared once the full game came out since tis has taken years to implement npc s modders have done so sure they re wonky as hell since they re stuck with whatever is accessible to them through the base code but at least they provided something devs continue to provide nothing 1 10 20original review was in 2016 still no npcs they no longer allow comments on their news or on their youtube videos guess they don t want to hear anymore complaints about no npcs of course i see their latest upcoming project will be the creation of a deer yes a deer and you will be able to see your backpacks those are the big projects it is now 10 14 17 developers have put cars in the game but instead of working on the npc s they decided to continue their pattern of inane micromanagment i see they are now working on cars breaking down and having to salvage parts to get the car running again they are working on tons of little things that really don t add value to the game check out the developers notes and you ll see what i mean they had npc s when the game came out the fans see below are saying they are working on npc s from the time they removed the npc s to now how many years has that been three years four years developers make complete games in that time period what s the holdup last time i checked developers are in the business to make money by selling their product or service they listen to what their customers want called marketing research and focus their efforts in that direction that s not what this developer has done they treat the development of this game as something they are making for their own personal satisfaction rather than to satisfy customers and make sales to the people who posted below here are my general thoughts an in game map with a gps or whatever technological magic might not be realistic but it would add to the fun factor you may disagree but don t you think it should be an option for gamers if you don t want to use it the developers could have a checkbox to toggle it off there was obviously a demand for a map and because the developers couldn t or wouldn t make the map in a timely manner a customer had to do it for them and now maps are in the game yet another example how misguided this developer is in thier business plan or lack thereof priorities vehicles took them a year at least from this post to put them in npc s were initially in and then removed why is is that they can create something from scratch vehicles in a year and yet can t complete something they had once before and then removed answer it s not a priority for them even though it s a priority for their customers it would be interesting to have a poll on steam by the developers to see what they should be putting their energy in next list npc s as an option not what color should the cabbage in the fridge be which is their usual micromanagment mode keep the poll open for two weeks and get some feedback when npc s are selected see if they continue to move at glacial pace or instead put some coal in the fire to get the train moving also interesting to note that they removed steam customer s ability to comment on their weekly updates section if you can call them updates i suspect due to the amount of criticism they are receiving from the people who bought their game and the direction they are taking it they redirect ed comments to their website so they can moderate and delete them sorry developers no amount of damage control will stop this ship from sinking unless you change your course
