2016 i played every paradox game since the very first europa universalis which was released in 2001 they were always quite unique and allowed you to play as virtually every country from the early medieval times through the victorian era until ww2 and even beyond i must admit i only play them vanilla just after release and this is perhaps what i like most about them moddability eu4 really becomes a whole different experience with meiou mod it adds so much depth amazing religious and development system that it makes it impossible for me to ever return to the vanilla version the same can be said about hearts of iron 3 which was a terrible game when it was released but was improved a lot over the years by the blackice team and through paying quite a bit for more and more dlcs hoi 4 seems different it has a lot of potential but it is extremely lacking when compared to other games both by paradox and other developers hearts of iron 2 and it s most modern spin off i guess darkest hour dh is based on a game that was released in 2005 but with some new great features like decisions decisions initiate events or chains of events which means that you don t need to wait for an event to fire you can do it yourself this feature has a lot of potential and is used by modders to allow you greater control over your country i must admit that i like darkest hour much more than hoi 4 because of its great mods that greatly expand the ww2 create a whole alternative universe of kaiserreich when the germans won the great war or let you play in the fallout universe hoi 4 lacks proper events and by far feels less immersive than modded dh national focus could have well been done with a decision system like in darkest hour that would also allow more choices hearts of iron 3 was extremely disappointing when it was released but still i get the feeling that this was a better game than hoi 4 and is much much better when using blackice mod in hoi 4 you don t have the chain of command system with divisions corps and armies something i really liked no releasable puppets or lend lease you have to pay a lot for them wiht their new dlc no air units just abstracted numbers on airfields region system which i believe works worse than province one and the ai is laughable admittedly ai was always a problem but hoi 4 gets the cake for the worst ai in my opinion when compared to gary grigsby s games it lacks its detailed units careful attention to even minute historical details well researched equipment and units and its ai which is much more challenging than hoi 4 one if you feel like a real grognard try those instead and devs constantly patch them even now years after release to make them even more accurate and fun it doesn t allow you to build units and you can t control every front just east or west depending on the game but the combat is way way superior when compared to decisive campaigns barbarossa it really lacks its great immersion and hundreds of tough choices that you have to make as a person responsible for barbarossa over the course of of several months hearts of iron 4 is very similar to stellaris in my opinion it also lacks features when compared to some other games of its kind and tries to be more casual but the truth is it can never be casual i don t mean that it has to look like microsoft excel with nothing but statistics but oversimplification is equally bad like no chain of command in hoi 4 only armies now and greatly simplified air units very shallow politics with just 4 sides instead of many ideologies of previous games odd trade where you are letting others use your factories for resources and national focus instead of proper event chains or darkest hour style decisions this makes for a really shallow game for those used to older installments in the series overall i can t say that i like hoi 4 even though i tried bought it on day one and was disappointed waites for patches and mods but so far even with blackice mod it is still the worst paradox game to date for me maybe second worst if you count oversimplified stellaris the only feature that i really love is equipment production which when modded properly will provide a lot of depth and a ground for many important choices similar to those of real life do i produce more panzer iv s which are easy to mass produce or will i switch for newer better models which will only be produced in greater numbers after a long time except for that the game is not worth it and for the end paradox dlc policy the newest dlcs contains nothing but features that should have been included from day one lend lease puppets been there done that without having to pay for dlcs it would have been really funny if it weren t so sad
