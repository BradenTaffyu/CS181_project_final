can t really support buying a game that just had a 25 dlc release that uses generative ai art not only is it completely unethical taking away work from actual voice actors it s just a general downgrade from the what is already in base game and previous dlc i don t know who s idea it was at paradox to do this but whoever it was should be fired or at the bare minimum given a mandatory ethics course
