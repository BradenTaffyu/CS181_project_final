2018 sadly i cannot recommend this game anymore it went from awesome to very bad first paradox thought that changing core features in fully released game is a good idea i tell you its not it is absolutely unacceptable to remove or change core features in game that is not early access game was advertised with 3 types of ftl and i bought it because i had options how to play now its just hyperlanes like all 4x games boring border expansion via starbases is terrible changes to war system are awful you can no longer do long wars because of so called war exhaustion if you really want to try it play 1 9 that is true stellaris and stay away from any later version sadly that mean also no more updates bug fixes
