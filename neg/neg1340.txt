2021 early access review bear with me this is a doozy and may be the only steam review i ever actually write i had astronomical hopes for this game i played warband religiously for years accumulating hundreds upon hundreds of hours it was my go to and i have many many fond memories from my childhood playing that game it s among my all time favorites i was there when bannerlord was announced i diligently checked for and read new dev diaries i remember when each faction each new mechanic was announced i followed this game s development for the entire long slog i remember when the ea was announced to the cheers of it s almost harvesting season from the fanbase i was ready to forgive just about any goof or gaff that tale worlds committed all for the chance to play the game that i had waited literally my entire middle school high school most of college life i didn t buy at first i did not have a good enough computer and i was troubled by some preliminary responses finally i got it i ve played it for over one hundred hours now it has so much that i loved from warband and i have had some tremendous fun playing at times however here i am leaving a negative review i waited eight long years for this game with an additional 10 months or so of ea development and the game is still noticeably unfinished the factions are still atrociously unbalanced plz fix the khuzaits they are still monstrously op even after your 1 5 7 beta nerf the companions have taken a large step down even from warband basically sacrificing any semblance of personality in exchange for sheer number of available companions the ai still has no idea how to conduct anything resembling effective diplomacy forgivable in 2010 but 100 inexcusable in the modern era of excellent grand strategy games the technology is absolutely there factions declare idiotic wars they could never win and then refuse to make peace even when attacked by multiple factions at once the tribute system is indecipherable there are still potentially campaign ending bugs snowballing is still a huge issue and executions are useless because the ai never uses them in my experience and the consequences for the player executing a lord are so steep that you basically have to commit your entire playthrough as a borderline genocide run because your relation with a ton of clans many of them random ass clans from across calradia that should not be batting an eye at this will be irreparably ruined the ai certainly has no concept of how to actually fight a battle forcing you to either always have a massive party to outnumber your enemy impossible because of party size limits and the relatively steep influence cost it takes to form and maintain a large army or micromanage the crap out of every soldier you have in real time while also trying to actually have fun and fight not instantly die they ve gotten rid of almost all passive experience gain so the only way to upgrade troops is by grinding out boring battles with looters who as a further slap in the face seem to always kill exactly one of your top tier troops in the process because the battle simulation sucks ass and because top tier noble troops are so hard to find in the first place let alone upgrade for the reasons previously listed i hope you enjoyed having that elite cataphract for all of two days they haven t even implemented all the perks for the skill tree yet after all this time i say all this to say that i m very disappointed even frustrated with how this game was developed so far i don t mean this to be personal because i know that tale worlds has to their massive credit been working hard at patching out bugs and rebalancing things as best as they can when they could have just taken the money and run i m just left scratching my head wondering why this game the one we have currently took so long based on what s there take this review as more of a caution against the ea game in its current state let me be clear the bones for a tremendous game are there i promise like i said i did have plenty of fun with this game despite its issues i ve just reached a point at which i can no longer ignore them and they are a bit too glaring for me to continue having fun with this game for the time being i ll be taking a break for a while for those of you considering buying at this point wait watch for hotfixes patches and updates read the forums and see how things seem to be progressing hold off until this games reaches its full release at the very least devs you haven t lost me yet but my trust in you has been strained please please iron things out and i will be back to dumping my hours into this game like i m a 12 year old playing warband again i will promptly delete or otherwise edit this review when that time comes for now i will sit tight harvesting season eludes me still
