2021 after playing over 70 hours in this game this game has the potential to be amazing but it currently suffers some fatal game design flaws that pretty much force you to rely on game breaking bugs or mechanics to really enjoy the game for that reason i wouldn t recommend playing this game as it seems like almost everyone who wants to really dive deep into this game ends up abusing the same bugs mechanics to get anywhere here s what i think this game does well it s like a dungeon keeper esq game you build out sprawling complex systems and bases while your little minions duplicants take your marching orders and complete them this game has an appeal to those who are interested in complexity and open ended freedom to play the game you want to play it this game is like engineering crack and there s always lessons to be learned to take back and apply in your next play through never ending optimization here s what this game needs improvements on you have to learn arbitrary conversions of mass energy that are specific to this game such as showers producing 1 unit of water 1 unit of polluted water but you ll have to memorize what buildings take as inputs outputs and abuse the game to the best of your ability for survival there s no way to look at the water resource and see how to produce it or consume it without going to google and finding some fan site that explains it in more detail conservation of energy mass isn t a thing it s very easy to get stuck in a pattern of survival where you re net negative in resource management and this game is extremely unforgiving in that respect for example some plants consume an insane amount of water bristles or polluted water like trees and its always a net negative loss to produce those crops this leads you to finding other game breaking bugs mechanics to produce food that s always net positive such as by using critters since they literally consume no resources to survive and produce food that s bad terrible game design this game is only made playable by many of the mods that improves the quality of life there are so many basic functions and features that mods fix in this game it s frustrating that they haven t put it into the native game nor attempted to make any improvements to the ui ux experience this game is very unforgiving and doesn t really provide guidance or teach you what went wrong your base will collapse mostly due to lack of a real complete game plan for example one of the games goals is to get 20 duplicants but that is an absolute trap and is not something you should strive to do period until you have net positive food resource production that is something that doesn t occur until mid late game you ll need to invest your own free time to read up on some of the game mechanics such as how plumbing or electricity works as they don t follow how things behave in the real world i m an engineer by career and it drives me nuts how incorrect their modeling was for these mechanics there s no real direction or goal in this game you start the game without any sense of what to do due to the lack of real conversation of energy mass the game designers have patched their solution by essentially forcing you to have two end game plans 1 use critters for food they basically consume zero resources 2 scout the map for natural geysers vents or volcanos as they produce an infinite amount of resources water gases metals etc this isn t good game design as it isn t obvious to the player that these strategies are an absolute must for survival nor does it really tackle the root problem that what you put in isn t what you get out
