2016 tldr buy it if you are hardcore into warhammer don t mind the very steep price tag and you want to read lore and see fantasy armies battle it out pass if you want a reasonably priced strategy game that is deep involved and fun to play you need to use a little foresight when considering a purchase of total war warhammer we are now seven months post release and there exists 65 worth of dlc at the moment so if you re looking for a complete experience consider this a 125 game ditto that for part two and three and you are looking at a 375 game are you alright with that if so read on the bread and butter of this game is the animated battles bottom line if you don t care about watching fantasy armies slaughtering eachother in real time you should just save yourself a lot of money and move on right now the strategy rpg elements and empire building in this game are nonexistant to barely recognizeable strategy begins and ends with trying to flank a paper unit with your scissors unit rpg elements begin and end with equiping boring items and putting skill points into mostly generic trees for your generals empire building begins and ends with deciding which mostly generic building trees you want to invest in then you just cut n paste across every region you conquer diplomacy is terrible and really just exists as a ton of spam you click through at the beginning of each round as a dwarf you will get peace treaties from orcs and vampires as if that makes any sense whatsoever vampires may declare war on you one turn then proceed to offer you gold for a peace treaty for the next 30 turns the turn based overland map is so clunky and random there seems to be little purpose outside of looking for battles that you can win your limited field of vision ensures enemy armies will constantly run in from the shadows and decimate your cities and armies before you have a chance to react they exhibit minimal ai and seem to exist as a harassing agent until they are disposed of the story is barebones impersonal and largely uninteresting their is a very comprehensive encyclopedia of warhammer lore built into the engine so you can read up on a lot of stuff if that is your scene the battles are pretty cool at first who can deny the awesomeness of clashing armies in a fantasy universe performace is acceptable and the graphics are noteworthy with a decent rig the highlight is the clashing of armies but they quickly devolve into blops of units with only the front line attacking everyone else just sort of stands around waiting for their turn to kill or die this tends to be immersion breaking if you really dial in to a single battle keep the camera moving however and you can look past this unfortunate issue the tedious redundant nature of the battles are unescapable unfortunately the blood and gore dlc is required in my opinion to give any sense of soul to these battles i literally quite playing the game after a few hours because it was an obvious omission that seriously reduced one s level of enjoyment bottom line battles get boring and they get boring fast battle maps are limited and you will never fight in sprawling cities or castle towns you basically have two battle maps wilderness or a siege against a single wall the vast majority of units can only be told where to go or who to attack no skills formations or stances mean battles are a click and watch affair cool for the first few times but tw w turns into an auto resolve game very quickly this is never more true than during the horribly under developed seige battles ugh what s left is the turn based world map and well i already told you what i think of that
