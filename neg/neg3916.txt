dont get me wrong i love this game and i love the grind but after 78 hours ive maxed out 1 car that was engine swapped so it was fully purple parts and i went back to the first engine that was in the car to check something only to realise i had to pay for the engine swap again and all the purple parts again please carx devs sort that out i was absolutely livid
