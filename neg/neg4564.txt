2017 game is currently plagued by horrible ai and diplomacy those two things make the game very bland after first play through to put it simply there is no diplomacy victory condition in the game yet guess for a good reason however it does feel like that feature was cut out from the game to sell it later in some expansion dlc for example city states have relationship statuses already they are rather pointless though as they do practically nothing ingame currently there are many other smaller issues that the game has but these two issues already make the game more bland than civ 5 was at launch yet here they don t have the same excuses because civ 6 uses many resources from civ 5 transition isn t anywhere near as big as it was from civ 4 to civ 5 there probably won t be any fixes until new expansions they haven t even touched em so far in this game s life cycle only more dlc to sell out in form of new civilizations therefore i recommend to stay away from buying this game maybe proper time to do so is when the eventual goty complete edition comes out in far away future it is rather sad as some new features in this game could be great and show some promise if expanded maybe the modders can fix many of the smaller problems might be a while as they were just released though
