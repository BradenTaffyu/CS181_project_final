2017 a very unpolished game full of bugs and glitches like freezing animals and sometimes no tracks or animals at all causing me to have to restart the game to try to get them to spawn the user interface is not at all inuitive and takes a bit of time to figure out how to properly equip yourself and then use that equipment then trying to figure out what item it is that you just pulled out takes getting used to as you cannot see the name of the item anywhere on the hud for example you can pull out one of the calls or scent sprays but you have no idea which one it is until you get very familiar with it s appearance as there is nothing anywhere that tells you what it is you just pulled out the animal ai is anything but realistic it s like there was little to no research that went into behavior patterns of different species and if there was it was very poorly implemented the gameplay mechanics are a total joke the movements are anything but fluid everything you try to do feels so delayed and robotic just to raise your gun to shoot or even to lower your gun back down is painfully slow but all this comes to be expected from developers at expansive worlds they promised this game would be a one time purchase with no microtransactions see thehunter classic reviews and forums for more bs on this then almost immediately came out with little dlc packages they screwed everyone over with thehunter primal again check thehunter primal reviews and forums to see the bs they left people with which was released years ago and still very broken to this day i regret going past the 2 hour mark for a refund on this title
