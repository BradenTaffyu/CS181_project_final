i think i regret buying it year ago when i was considering buying i thought the map will be on level of fh4 or better but its just desert with every road being big in fh4 we had forests mountains farms a big river suburbs and very cool city now its few farms city that fits better into red dead redemption than a racing game just one volcano and the rest is desert in forza horizon 4 there were a lot of very cool places to roleplay like a small parking behind townhouse now we have slums because in city every garden is closed its now more like a typical roblox racing game than old good forza at least there are 2022 23 cars
