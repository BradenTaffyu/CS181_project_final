2021 as with most people that play this and the previous game we re all fans of jurassic park pros graphics granular dinosaur comfort levels minus the rocks cons linear campaign where you really have no flexibility or creativeness non obvious controls though the original game was challenging also lack of a park like setting though this story is not about that see below cryptic use of scientists and too much management campaign is a grind and doesn t really give you any sense of accomplishment other than you can follow directions it s a management simulator for escaped dinosaursjust starting the california task and i m disappointed sure i ll play through it because i love the movies at this point i can t say that i enjoy it and i also wouldn t recommend it for younger players just too boring and not much reward before i get flames for that no i m not looking for instant gratification it s just not enjoyable for someone who wants to play through a story and have the freedom to make choices instead of being driven through every step the scientist thing is just annoying when all is said and done they ll rank up and you ll continue i m not sure what they really provide to the game other than to waste time but it may be that they are needed to add time to a wash rinse repeat cycle maybe it will be better when i get through the campaign and unlock the fun stuff i really appreciate what frontier and the developers have created though i think it misses what some of us really wanted yes we wanted more than the first game but i don t feel this is what the majority wanted update 1 into jp 1 chaos theory we now have the park setting like the original game it s still too much of a grind do we really need to spend hours of real time trying to get the point where we can open the park not to mention that you ll run out of money if you don t realize how many linear quests you have to do before you can even open the park to gain income don t do anything extra do the required tasks get the park open and then build extra stuff it has all the features of the first game with much more tedious management filling the fuel for the power generators is just too much drama while fast forwarding and waiting on scientists to rest after researching something completely irrelevant do scientists really care about a restaurant it s getting tough for me to open the game i don t want to sit for hours to accomplish a few tasks it s no surprise that there s a speed up time option flames would be an inferno the only reason i m playing it is because i love jurassic park and i paid a lot of for the game i still can t recommend this one but i would recommend the original update 2 pros graphics when things don t flicker granular dinosaur and customer comfort levels much better than the first gamecons everything above and moreafter making it through jp1 chaos the rating doesn t change very pleased that the park scenario is there i received a question about dino ai really can t say much when i have a huge pen with brachiosauruses and other herbivores in it with more than enough food and forest in their perceived territory but they decide to walk all the way over the other end and then complain that they don t have enough food transport them back over and they re happy until they walk back down to the other end and start complaining again i guess that they extend their territory and just assume that it s all for them doesn t seem like good ai then there s the other herbivores that just love to attack within the species so i have to heal them send them back only to have them do the same thing sure maybe that was the thing to do millions of years ago then i have a t rex where i incubated it to be tame and it attacks the ranger jeep more than it did when it was aggressive first one died of old age not much to say there still waiting for it to kill the stupid dilophosaurus that i put in the pen because it constantly gets into fights then i incubate and not all the dinosaurs come out of the hatchery of course it starves to death because it can t get out no big loss could i have tranquilized it and lifted it out probably but i was too busy managing my scientists and filling fuel then more bugs pop up where i have dino s with an ailment and a health issue i set them up for transport to a medical facility and assign scientists by the time the transport gets to the dino it s dead and it never transports it to the facility can t remove it from the map either and it lays there blocking my park tour okay move the track a bit i then find that the medical facility is waiting on transport i can t destroy the building and all my scientists are locked to the medical facility waiting for a dinosaur i can t transport there can t drop another dino in there because it says it has a treatment pending it s not just about the ai i m happy that they all don t freak out and break out of their pens for every storm it s the full experience that is a bit of a let down so i m at 5 stars on jp1 chaos then i get a task to do so i select the customer facing one where i get the increase transport rating huh i ve researched everything possible so i have to assume it s about the monorail really it s not available in research and greyed out for jp1 come on how does that get missed why am i writing all this because i really loved the movies and the first game i m just disappointed
