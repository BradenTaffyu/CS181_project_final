2021 i love the intellectual property of arma 3 but bohemia interactive released a product that had very little content to it and they charged a premium price the dlc adds content that was blatantly cut from the base game so they could profit more bohemia interactive seriously released a bare bones working title with a weak skeleton and sat back to let the modders come in and add content when you have modders who develop a better quality of life gameplay and content that far supersedes the development of bohemia interactive it really makes your company look downright incompetent and or uncaring i do not believe in bohemia interactive s ability any more profit margins and investor incentives are what they look forward to i believe in the modders and the community who have shown themselves throughout the years to have more passion and interest than bohemia interactive have given thank you modding community for all of your hard work and glorious ideas bohemia interactive expletive expletive and expletive
