2023 early access review the game is pay 2 win reason every month a new op card is added locked behind a season pass paywall after 1 month this card will be available for f2p players too but very rare difficult to get every 12 collection level you have 0 25 chance to hit a 1 in 11 from pool 5 where last season p2w card is located keep in mind now a brand new season pass card has been added so even if you acquire last season s card you re always gonna be at minimum 1 extremely strong deck defining op card behind this last season s card had the top3 meta decks based around it according to marvelsnapzone tier list the paywall locked season pass card being extremely strong is just one of many predatory monetization behaviors from this developer update 7 march after 180 hours tl dr at bottom last month season pass card was also deck defining but actually really well balanced i m not gonna change the review status as having gameplay content locked behind a paywall at all times is the definition of pay 2 win imo also read next paragraph it gets worse the card acquisition gets really grindy as you progress like really grindy actually its not even possible to grind to completion according to popular streamers they need to spend usd 500 a month to keep up with the 4 5 new cards released into pool 5 each month considering 1 of those is the 10 season pass card that speaks volumes of how hard it will be for f2p players to acquire previous season pass cards realistically i think the best strategy is to wait until it gets downgraded twice to pool 3 at which time you are now waiting not 1 month but 5 months to get a previous season pass card as a f2p player which obviously means it s not 1 but 5 cards that are locked behind a paywall at all times effectively the previous 2 season pass cards were nerfed which was needed but also leads to situations where a the stuff you spent real money on loses its value or b f2p players gets the scraps after p2w players got to enjoy it at the peak the matchmaking is really poor too much to explain but basically the new player experience is quite literally 90 100 bots you will work up a high hidden mmr from farming bots so once you hit a magical threshold collection level 600 you get matched against high skilled players with a collection thousands of levels above you later on if you are a high skilled player you will eventually get so high hidden mmr that apparently once again all you fight is bots the developer seems incapable of swiftly making balance changes in fact in a recent patch note they admitted they were basing their balancing changes of the previous old meta yes that s what they said as they buffed one of the best card deck and nerfed a card that already had fallen off the meta i assume it has something to do with them having to jump through a bunch of legal marketing whatever hoops due to it being the marvel franchise also doesn t help that cards are poorly balanced at release over as well as underpowered positives yeah the game is a fresh take on the genre the fact that i keep sinking all my time into it as a f2p player speaks for itself however you need to accept that you will be at an competitive disadvantage forever unless you spend you can get all pool 3 cards maybe you can keep up with pool 4 but it will literally be impossible to stay on top of pool 5 cards for you according to those who did the math after you are pool 3 complete you can grind a single pool 5 card a month of the 4 5 released or two pool 4 cards so i guess that means it s not actually possible to even keep up with pool 4 not sure tl dr pay 2 win is worse than initially thought you will generally be missing up to 5 season pass cards at all times not 1 you need 500 a month to fully keep up literally impossible to ever catch up the game is fresh and fun if you are not competitive
