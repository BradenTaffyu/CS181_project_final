2016 open world shooter with light rpg elements takes place in post apocalyptic boston roughly 200 years after nuclear war has a variety of upgradable weapons and armor to use against various mutated monsters and people follows a main story alongside numerous sidequest and locales introduces settlement building to manage and take care of probably the weakest released bethesda title i ve played improvements in gunplay are certainly noteworthy compared to f3 and fnv but the game suffers in other areas story is one of the weakest of bethesda games which has never been their strong suit it revolves around factions which are unrelatable and are very vague in goals making supporting them uninteresting settlement building is a novel idea that feels very unfinished unpolished and very time comsuming the world exploration is solid for an open world game but its questing doesn t add much needed depth to it graphically it is superior to prior releases but compared to other games of this time period its satisfactory game stability varies between person if you ve played any bethesda game you ll know there is a level of unpolish you re gonna have to put up with in short expect some stability problems workshop vault building dlc are essentially glorified mods that offer little useful content to improve the settlement building unless you re hardcore into the settlement system don t bother with them far harbor is solid dlc content its story and quests are more well thought out than the base game the automatron dlc content is solid but it doesn t add very much and it s story is quite short the modding community for fallout 4 is easily the weakest of bethesda game the toolkit released long after launch and requires the use of bethesda s new launcher and login system bethesda s own modding site is a disaster horrible to navigate and riddle with stolen mods that killed a lot of apetite for modders their response has been very lack luster and they seem unwilling to improve modding third party mod sites remain the go to place for pc but has seen a hit in content because many modders have decided not to mod for f4 overall its not a bad game but it is disappointing for a bethesda release the company seems to be coasting on past successes and its flaky games just aren t cute anymore too many of its competitors have steped up their game in open world games the same unpolished content just isn t good enough anymore on top of that they seem to have forgotten how important the modding community was to the pc space and how it dramatically increased the longevity of it s previous games you ll probably still get good hours out of the game buts it doesn t catch me the way previous games did
