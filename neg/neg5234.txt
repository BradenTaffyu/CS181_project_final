2017 pros 1 the game has some of the best pathfinding for troop movement out of all te total war series 2 the game brings monsters which make seige battles and just battles in general a little more epic3 the game is super fast paced so you dont need to spend 30 minutes waiting for battle lines to slowly dwindle to nothing4 the battles and effects are just flawless watching your games in replay is like watching a warhammer movie 5 the factions are diverse and units have stats that actually matter and can impact a battle pretty heavily6 the campains are different for each faction which makes replayability a thing 7 the ai was extremely well made and it actually makes smart tactical decisions against you esspecially with calvery cons 1 the dlc make this game seem incomplete i see these other factions but i cant even assign them to the enemy ai bot in a custom battle2 if you are going to make dlc at least make it available in a sale or something 3 i bought this game for 40 in a sale and it still feels like i bought a 20 game becuase of how gutted the core game is 4 if you want super long battles this is not the game for you they end fast and if you want to see some epic action you alwasy have to watch the replay becuase you are to busy microing your army during the fight 5 if you dont have directx 11 its ok run everything on teh below mario64 settings and it runs ok given that some battles start with a pitch black screen which can be fixed by exiting the match and just starting the match back up 6 fairly long load times for individual matches 7 some factions feel like they could use a boost in stats like greenskins vs counts about 3 minutes into that kind of game and the counts have the greenskins just running with fear while their casualties are like 70 men out of a 1200 man army heros help with this but not by much 8 the ai if given artilery in a land battle will just sit there the whole game and try to fire on you this needs to be fixed 9 you have to set the ai up with an army that has no artilery so it has to advance and even then if you dont have artilery the ai parks its army on a large hill which always leads for such a dull upward hill battle ps yes the dlc is bull crap but the game is alright in its current stage however due to the lack of content for the price this review ends in a negative review if i had more content to grade like the other 3 factions this review would probably be positive
