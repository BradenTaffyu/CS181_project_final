2023 if you re a hp fan it s a must if you don t care about hp and have something else to play probably wait for performance fixes sale if you don t care about hp and don t have anything else to play go for it game has massive fps drops memory leaks and occasional crashes on a more than decent rig even after day 1 performance hotfix things that helped me greatly 1 installing ascendio mod from nexusmods 2 swapping dlss version to latest with dlss swapper free app btw 3 turning off ray tracing and vsync in game settings the story and puzzles are mediocre game is rather linear where it thrives for me personally is combat it features some souls like elements spell combos potion and plant usage but i barely died in fights even on hard difficulty don t go for anything lower than hard unless you re a casual overall for me as a hp fan it s 10 10 you can traverse hogwarts discover secret rooms talk to ghosts use a variety of spells learn unforgivable curses get some relics visit legendary ollivander shop and much much more all the things i dreamed of since i read my first hp book for me as a gamer disregarding my hp affection the game is 6 5 10 i did greatly enjoy the game but do not wish to support devs releasing aaa games in the current state as well as releasing console exclusive content you can open your own shop in hogsmeade is you re a lucky owner of ps5 but for us poor pc plebs performance issues is the only exclusive for now hereby leaving a negative review
