2022 the developers haven t fixed bugs with multiple units and civilizations since the launch of the game six months ago and are bound by microsoft protocols that allow for an unbelievably slow pace of patches very underwhelming experience especially when there are far better developers out there who respond to their community more promptly and with more logical balances i can t imagine someone who spent their time learning the mechanics of a civ enjoys getting their civilization nerfed every single patch with the lowest win rate
