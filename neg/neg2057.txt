2018 this game does not respect you or your time avoid it the grind is horrific and the matchmaking balance is attrocious the ground game is claustrophobic cramped is an understatement the knife fights that form the basis of the ground game do an injustice to the vehicle modeling and ballistics you don t make a game about guns and then force everyone into a knife fight the ground game is a grind beyond belief i ve yet to encounter a game as grindy as warthunder unless you re on a winning team you ll be facing hundreds of battles to see any meaningful progress this game relies on team play unfortunately the community is toxic and cheating as well as griefing are ever present frustration upon frustration is what i d call this game everyone is out for themselves and so this game based around team play ends up being an annoying and frustrating experience and should you win a pittance reward awaits you the air portion of the game doesn t really have any cheating but sadly the team play aspects do not improve once airborne slightly less of a grind than the second job that the ground game is you ll still be playing days weeks and even months to get that next plane you ll be stuck playing maps you dislike against players who dislike you with team mates who ll ignore you prepare to grind prepare to be stuck in terrible vehicles that are outclassed by many of your opponents avoid the community where you can to retain some small amount of faith in humanity despair at each new announcement from the developers as it ll include some new hair brained money making scheme currency upon currency lootboxes expensive stores and other more expensive stores progression is measured at a pace comparable to a snail the community might kindly be called unwelcoming the devs are acerbic insulting and generally very disrespectful of their players like most pvp games of this sort you re intended to win 50 of the time and lose the other 50 of the time this is a game that feels as if it punishes you for your losses and doesn t reward you for your wins dear reader do not start on this treadmill respect your time and respect yourself spend your time and money on games that work to be worthy of you rather than games like this that are the opposite and thusly abusive of you
