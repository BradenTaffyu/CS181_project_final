2017 saying i do not recommend this game really pains me i wanted to like it i wanted to love it but i just can ti am not a part time player almost 900 hours on civ 5 and around 30 in on civ 6 thus far the ai is idiotic completely inept and does the most stupid things over and over again giving far too much ease to the human player to steamroll them the constant denouncing for very minor things i got declared war on by the 2 ai they never came to attack so i took the offense took some cities got denounced by several civs for being a warmonger what ai asks you to join a war with them i do and they then denounce me for being a warmonger lol come on now wonders are now mostly eye candy in most cases not worth the effort or tile loss to build them other than the odd exception which is a pity as they made a big difference in civ 5 the turn times seem more tedious than civ 5 watching their 27 000 relgious spawns running all over the map had to turn quick movement on to save my sanity of each turn be was bad this is not too much better please fix i want to love this like i do civ 5 it does look very pretty though once used to the graphics change
