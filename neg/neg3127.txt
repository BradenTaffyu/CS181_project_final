i m at the point where its nothing but grinding with little gain dockyard mission 7 you need 50 000 free xp i do a pve battle with 1 2 kills and i survive i get 50 free xp that s roughly 1000 games to beat this part of the missions i don t have buffs i m not paying for buffs let s not even talk about the coin you need to purchase the next ship i need 12 million to buy the next ship the game is fun unless you pay money for currency or a next ship it s just boring grinding
