2023 do not buy a subscription through steam i bought a 30 day subscription through steam but i wish i had checked the reviews on the store page first buying a subscription through steam is broken and will not show up in game ea s support page says to contact steam steam support sends you to ea you can t submit a ticket to swtor unless you are a subscriber as steam won t refund subscriptions the fact that there isn t a warning on swtor s store page or a better effort to fix the issue basically makes this theft false advertising between this and the swtor s website not wanting to work with debit credit cards i have never seen a game make it harder for me to give them my money
