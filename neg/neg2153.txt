2013 i would of recommended this before 1 37 but since 1 37 changed everything it is now ruined for what it was i would wait for gaijin to realize the mistake of the tier i v system that they have implemented to replace the tier 1 20 system they broke the hb which is now known as rb by introducing mixed nations to historical battles just like arcade which is a huge disappointment but this is way too far if this is an attempt to compete or be better than world of war planes then this is a huge mistake you were already blowing them out of the water you may or may not have just sank to their level congrats there is a possibility that you have have ruined a game that i loved i just hope that you realise what you have done and fix this mess i ll have to say that i don t recommend this game post 1 37 patch
