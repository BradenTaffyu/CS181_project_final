2013 if you are an arma fan this game will change all that when you spen 60 and your computer can t run it it will be because your computer is crappy when you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other arma games you will be called spoiled when there is nothing to do offline no point or story it s because it s still in the works even though it s a full release when you can t eek out better than 10fps no matter what your specs it s because you didn t tweak enough when you can t find a server to play on it s because you don t know the right clan when you do get on a server and it lags greifs and glitches it s because you play on crappy servers when you don t think it s realistic it s not a sim when you cant have any shoot em up fun like bf it s because it is a sim when all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not arma3 it s not fair to compare when you voice any of the above views here or the bi forums you are a liar
