2021 first off i want to make clear that i m not hating on the game and i m happy for all the people who enjoy it the way it is which is a lot of people if you check the reviews but i wanted to leave this review for others like me who are not sure if the game is for them and leave some points to consider what i enjoyed about rimworld was the freedom it gives you in creating your colony and the stories you can create and how every playthrough is different the quests and interactions with other settlements also help creating an continually interesting expirience i also enjoyed the ideology dlc which i think gives it even more depth and customization options but then there s everything that annoyed me first thing was the atrocious ui not just the design and the menu hierarchy but also how and where information is displayed this i think is also true for the rest of the game this is a shame because information is such a central part of such games and there s a lot of necessary information you have to figure out on your own or look up in the wiki because the tutorial doesn t tell you from clothes and armor to temperature roofs mental breaks and more it was very frustrating to figure out that roof collapses are a thing by one of my colonists dying and the last big thing that i think is important to consider before buying is the micromanagement of your colonists not just the colony but every individual person if you re into that that s good for you but this was a bit too much for my taste i don t want to tell them to remove the roof before removing all walls of a building or that one rock is ok to mine and the other not or else they die sometimes they are smart enough like putting on better clothes when available but other times they are stupid and go eat insect jelly in the middle of an infestation when on a food binge and yes there are mods to adress a great many of issues and change the game to your will but if the game is just a canvas i have to fill with mods then it should cost half than what it currently does the game is still being worked on and maybe things will change in which case i ll adapt this review but until then i can not recommend to buy this at full price as a similar game i can recommend prison architect which costs slightly less and offers a more refined expirience imo
