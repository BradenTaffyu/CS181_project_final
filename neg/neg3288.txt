2017 pro first since this is a downvote nice graphics amazing music easy to get into fun with friends it feels good to watch the battle and it feels even better to fight a very close war lasting over 2 years especially if you win you can play literally every nation in the game i like that you can customize exactly how your army is built upcontra gets stale very fast after 30 hours without mods 90 hours with mods took over the world with spain by now so im calling quits after a while all the countries play out almost the same most countries do have the same ideas certain things are very broken as usual dlc s are a joke both in content and price i heavily recommend getting mods instead if you do happen to buy the game planning system sometimes does really weird things some controls are weirdly mapped too horrible performance for me after 1940 no coring mechanic no conscription mechanic if you are out of manpower you lose wars allies and peace treaties can be a huge pain ai is just terribad tries naval invasions with either 2 or 18 troops sometimes in incredibly terrible spots who invades the nothern tip of norway instead of france thats right this ai doesnt react correctly to declerations of war sometimes declares war in unbeliveably bad situations or way too late after it already had a reason for war doesnt build their units right yada yada diplomatic system is unfullfilling at best political system is not really existentall in all even if you are a fan of paradox or especially if you are a fan of paradox dont get this game outside of sales its simply not worth that much and please dont buy the dlc the way you enjoy this game is with a bunch of friends all having the same mods in multiplayer on amazing pc s so the endgame isnt meaningless if you wanted to buy this for singleplayer i can hardly recommend it and if you still happen to question why in the world this is a downvote even if i spend 92 hours and said 30 without mods were fun well the least a dev can do for the consumer is make a game fun on its own but since this is a gsg i would expect it to be fun still well 100 200 hours into playing the game that just doesn t happen fun falls and breaks its neck sometime after you pulled off 2 different countries and then you can t go back without mods or multiplayer or at the point where you realize most countries have exactly the same ideas thats not acceptable especially not for 40 especially not for that kind of dlc you wanna sell
