2022 i didn t have time to write a short letter so i wrote a long one instead mark twaingonna be honest i realize i m going against the grain here there s over 100k positive reviews so take this with a grain of salt my experience with mount and blade was similar to that of a smoker to malboros it s not a good game by any means and yet i was utterly addicted to it you assume the role of a noble within the continent of calradia with six factions warring to conquer it sculpting an army and conquering territory and well that s it perhaps my favorite bad game the prosthis is a very organic rpg perhaps the truest form no story you write it yourself it s like the nemesis system from shadow of mordor blown up to over 200 individuals kingdoms factions and cities party management is a lot of fun my armies have always been something that i hand picked and oversawsieges are a blast even if they ve got huge bottlenecks and the ai has absolutely no idea what is going onfief castle and city management is straightforward and self sufficient without too much distraction from the core game loop it feels like an authentic medieval experience the art direction for models and score is on point it was hilarious when the marshall let me marry his daughter then defected and was jailed in the castle with his daughter holding the key cranking up the difficulty doesn t require skill per se but it does require a different mindset i played with the difficulty and had an easy time finding where i was comfortable there were lots of times where i was deep into a power fantasy with a small but drilled army that could take anything on the consgraphically mount and blade is not impressive at all even when it released in 2010 allied ai is super frustrating to work with since they can t count if the sum of our armies exceeds one enemy there are many instances where they ll still run away the only line of dialogue is yearg screamed dozens of times each battle well maybe also a my lord finding people allies or enemies is a huge chore and often leaves you like but i was just there the mid game is boring and aimless late game is sluggish if you re not in command of your faction late game combat can be extremely cumbersome and boring like you can absolutely capture every castle by yourself but the ai will just swoop in while you re gone and undo all your progress battles are not significant enough without a place to stash enemies they come back incredibly quickly once you have a town or castle it s much easier to snowball an enemy which is why the mid game is so boring the interface is bad to the point that text will be on top of text and things highlight in lime green which is impossible to read at smaller font sizes the book merchant s inventory never renewscombat areas look procedurally generated and many locales are not enjoyable at all to fight in this game is simple to the point that it feels barebones like it isn t finished while i liked the simplicity when getting started i was constantly seeing places where i d make improvements if i were a developer the indecisiveat its core mount and blade warband is a huge grind speedruns are over 9 hours on the easiest difficulty and on harder difficulties it may take dozens at the shortest skim some other reviews and expect a single playthrough to take you at least 50 hours the score isn t half bad but with how long it takes to get anywhere you ve heard everything for several hours when you re reaching the endgame combat is simple but also feels somewhat unrefined blocking is borderline overpowered against ai whereas thrown weapons are almost always a hindrance attacking is based on the vector your mouse takes so your camera will be going all over the place but after a while this gave it a bit of charm in ways that the simplicity of the overworld dialogue and progression failed couched lance damage hits like a serbian father in law which feels great to deliver but never feels fair to receive renown honor and right to rule are still systems that i don t entirely understand fortunately you don t really need to this game potentially has a lot of reading if you really want to know the lore this reading is primarily functional and can change as your saves progress so the lore can be hit or miss khergits specialize in horses which makes them take twice as long to fight because of how annoying they can be playing as them is great by the late game there has been a lot of flip flopping between factions and from a cultural perspective there is little to distinguish the combat style of one faction to another if your horse goes down in battle you re basically a potted plant this game is highly moddable but i haven t really explored that at all the verdictmy first sesh was 13 hours of bliss once i knew what i was doing however the gameplay lost most of the wind in its sails so why did i stick with the grind in such an underwhelming game well do you like runescape for the numbers do you play fifa for the single player campaign there s an audience that this title is perfect for watching numbers slowly go up is satisfying in this title you re able to directly tie it to a power trip and the poor graphics gameplay and audio can seemingly melt away while i loved it i know plenty of people who wouldn t i m glad it got a sequel that s addressing most of the cons this game frequently goes on sale for less than 5 bucks so if you want to test the waters this is a good choice i never played the multiplayer or modded it but there is more to explore which isn t addressed in this review all that being said it s a different kind of grind than mainstream experiences will give you and unless that s your cup of tea this game will come across as a bland hog of your time 5 5 10
