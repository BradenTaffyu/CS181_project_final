2017 fallout 4 suffers from the sequel disease in other words the magic is gone the creative spark lit a fire that fire burned out and now we re all loitering around the ashes because we re cold and nostalgic for warmth this happens to too many franchises across all mediums an original story or idea is envisioned by a creative person this story gets flushed out and loved and three years later the marketing executives have forced the creator to write a sequel even though the creative impulse that drove him into the project in the first place has been exhausted if you ve ever been in a creative writing class you know that there s nothing worse than reading a story that the author didn t really want to write if you enjoy reading stories like these i can only imagine that you also like chewing on sawdust and passing your days staring at a white wall in the end obligation is no fuel for art and fallout 4 unfortunately is the obligatory story written by an obliging author i can only guess that it was created because it was profitable fallout 3 and new vegas had a special charm their characters were unique and original the worlds they created were interesting in spite of their emptiness when i explored the wasteland in those games i did it because i was excited to find something new i was excited to find a vault where a surreal and inhuman experiment was taking place i was exited to meet a new faction that had a unique character and history i could tell that the creators of these games enjoyed their project they made the worlds interesting and i think they did this because they created what sounded interesting and fun to them i get the feeling as i do from all good art that that the creators enjoyed the creation process the charm of those games was enticing enough that it compelled us to spend hundreds of hours running across a post apocalyptic wasteland in fallout 4 the desire to explore is suppressed by the blandness that overwhelms every aspect of the world the characters are dead and unrealistic their dialogue is dry predictable and melodramatic the world is boring the vaults are all but gone the storylines are predictable uninteresting and uninspired perhaps uninspired is the best word for this game if the creators really loved creating this world i don t see any evidence of it i don t sense the excitement joy or empathy that the creators felt when they occupied this world with characters and stories in place of inspiration fallout 4 was infused with empty spectacle improved graphics better shooting a crafting system and the unasked for town creating mechanic i felt a bit like fallout 4 was just the polished taxidermized corpse of fallout 3 sure it looks better now that its been dolled up and had fake pecks installed but its heart isn t beating i still spent 56 hours on this damn game but don t misinterpret that as positive feedback 30 hours were spent exploring every nook and cranny so that i could be 100 sure that my disappointment was warranted 15 hours were spent enjoying the unavoidable appeal of open world games getting to be a uninhibited crazy person in a life that is not my own the remaining 10 hours were spent trying to figure out how the hell such bad writing and story crafting was deemed passable in a triple a game while hundreds of good writers with masters degrees are crying on college campuses unable to get their novels published so no don t buy this game unless the appeal of an admittedly pretty sandbox is enough to get you past an unengaging experience your time would be better spent reading a good book about some like the human spirit but what am i talking about we re all video gamers here i m going to reinstall it and see if someone has come out with a mod that turns me into master chief
