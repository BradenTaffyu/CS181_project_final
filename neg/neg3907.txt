2019 early access review this game used to be really good during before and up to alpha 16 but alpha 17 came along and it kinda killed it the grind for building a base is atrocious skills are level locked which really limits what you can do and is honestly annoying would be better if they were just skill point locked instead furthermore no matter how good of a base you build it is basically trash no point in building anything its not a base building survival game anymore the best thing to do is just level up now and becomes a zombie grind fest i would really want to get back into it to test out the electricity stuff but i just can t with these changes that make everything pointless
