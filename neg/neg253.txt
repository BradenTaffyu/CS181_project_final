2023 payday 3 is a fine example of a fantastic core game compounded by baffling outside decisions stepping back into the heisting world it s immediately a blast and that can persist for a long time however this is all defeated immediately by a lack of offline functionality incredibly laborious challenge xp system questionable currency systems and a general lack of polish outside of that it doesn t take a genius to know that payday 3 is a stepup from payday 2 some people will describe it as a regression but i find that a complete exaggeration the way it plays is toned down but it is vastly more breakneck than it s ancient contemporary of pdth it s a hybrid of game design philosophies with many of the conventions of both heists are fantastic a much mightier offering than payday 2 s launch they aren t quite as inspired or have as much personality as pdth s initial offerings but there is a lot to enjoy here the same cooperative objective teamwork you re used to in loud and stealth weapon feedback is really good much better than payday 2 right down to the hk mp7 slap or the pump of a shotgun helmets fly explosions ring chaos enemies generally are better ai wise with some exceptions there is a lot of good here when you read everything below i don t want you to get the general impression the game is impossible to come back from it s not stealth i m not a big stealth player for me the action is the juice but giving it a few shots even as far overkill it s much better this time around the scaling in difficulty does affect the heists drastically in stealth and some heists similar to counterfeit in the past are assisted even in loud by taking the first few steps in stealth you have so many more tools and the ai has so many more nuances that it s much easier to slip into it i ve played a lot of payday 3 and i gotta say this much while you level up initially pretty quick that doesn t last forever around the 60 to 70 level mark it gets harder the bar to achieve levels gets higher until you re scrounging out whatever you can it gets really really bad this is all before you even hit level cap weapon levels are more efficently ground out by running one heist and staying as long as you can in loud to get kills to level them up if you run stealth you barely get anything at all it needs more of an incentive to complete heists than just grind on the same one for a hour i m gonna shortly talk about c stacks it s a psuedo crypto system that you can sink your money into as you buy c stacks they get more expensive each week before resetting however these are the endgame currency save them as much as you can weapon attachments loadout slots and even prices as high as 500 c stacks mean that the game will take multiple weeks in order to get the preset you want assuming you re even the level to get them in the first place it sounds great at first until you realise that the weapon attachments you can buy with c stacks are stuck to that particular weapon and do not unlock it forever you get another gun of that type you wanna use for stealth too bad another 50 c stacks loadout slots are going to become an issue as more and more guns are added to the game 100 c stacks doesn t sound like too much in the grand scheme of things but throw that in ontop of other things you have to pay for and it just doesn t feel great the ui ux are frankly a bit terrible they aren t good especially with the heist selection menu it works great for a first time player running through the heists for the first time but that ll last around 7 hours lobby systems are utterly awful you can t pick and choose which lobby to choice in a browser you re just thrown into matchmaking will you get a game or will you not that s down to the servers it s no secret this game has had some serious problems with server stability and i ve seen it all i don t think i can add anything here that will surprise you or be different from anything else that anyone else says it sucks and has made every issue above even worse i hate to do this i have so much fun with this game i cannot recommend payday 3 not right now wait wait wait
