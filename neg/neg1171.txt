2017 this game is a joke compared to previous fallout games they took out a majority of the role playing in a role playing game and is just a mindless hack slash crawl the story isn t quite all there side quests are all more or less the same charisma is borderline useless and it all just kind of blends together there are no real unique builds like in previous games as there is no lvl cap and you can just max literally every stat which really takes out the innovative builds as for the dlcs and season pass don t bother still the same rinse and repeat cycle except with a slightly better story in far habor but thats about all you re gonna get just overpriced garbage now on top of insult after insult to their community bethesda has decided to add a creation club where you can purchase mini dlcs all they are trying to do is milk their community for as much money as they possibly can by adding their paid mods that are installed to your drive regardless if you want it and for all you vr users who have already played their games well now you can buy them for full price again with vr compatibility tldr game is terrible company is terrible
