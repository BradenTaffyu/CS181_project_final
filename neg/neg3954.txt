pros the best nascar road course simulator money can buy cons too expensive for those that want it all my review is negative because private hosted races should not cost money when the customer is paying for everything else extended pros excellent vr peripheral support i made a full size aluminum rail cockpit for driving simulators never once have i had an issue with vr moza wheel heusinkveld pedals varjo aero or triple screens optimized for the potato est among potato computers might change come rain updates highest grade simulation quality hands down the best possible not guaranteed multiplayer experience you will get in a competitive racing game thanks to the incident and reporting system constantly updated by very active and interested developers that will stop at nothing to make the best simulation possible i race the 3h 24h events for fun it s extremely fun and thrilling to get to race in such a long event every month or so the patch notes are huge expansive and detail everything being fixed or worked on a ridiculous variety of motorsports are available to race with see cons about race sizes crashes are visceral brutal and have a good damage model system it teaches drivers to drive for the race not the position usually the best races are the ones with pit stops endurance events laser scanned tracks with crazy realistic track data and road parameters tracks are lifelike to the utmost degree if you race an official race every week during a 12 1 week season you can get a few dollars for your time the ai for solo racing or practicing is pretty awesome it s fairly new and yet it s far better than many other racing games now for the cons which mainly revolve around cost 1 month is 12 99 a month 6 months is 11 67 a month 12 months is 9 42 a month just like eve wow etc subscriptions are expensive and iracing doesn t give enough incentive to purchase more time outright privately hosted races and servers require money to pay for typically 0 50 an hour you cannot race with your friends unless you create custom servers or are very equal in irating and get lucky with splits or you run in low population events this is absurd and hosting a private session should be free if people are already paying for tracks cars and a subscription tracks cars are sold separately and can add up very quickly expect 8 15 per track and car you typically only need one track car to gain a full racing license some people get away with a single car purchase and subscription graphics leave a little to be desired at times but aren t bad by any means for a 15 year old game with live updates this also helps the game run phenomenally well for vr or triple screens no rain simulation yet its coming the next update and looks promising low population races exist there is a chance that the car track combo you want is not played by many players except in one or two peak hours held by 3rd party gaming groups or event creators this can occur during peak playing hours too since the population of iracing is worldwide peak hours for some events or races can be a little difficult to adjust to not all damage models are similar and some cars are more forgiving than others with damage this is being actively worked on and not a lot of cars are left on the old damage model it s a competitive online game you will find idiots infrequently but they do exist the steward system is not very transparent on what actions are taken against specific drivers but through rumors and experience it feels like the steward system generally does it s job well in summary i will probably play iracing till i die i love simulations i love racing i love my vr i love the community i love the atmosphere maki love the friends i e i love the stories i get to tell this game seems like it s genuinely taking multiplayer racing seriously enough and well enough that i want to give it my money to support it however i would like to not have to pay for hosting a custom server or a custom race with friends by paying money that really sucks sometimes when i just want to sit at nords poodling with my friends for 6 hours but that server time costs 3 plus the track which was 14 with a 12 car while paying for a minimum 9 a month membership to use the content i have purchased already if this changes as the game grows and expands i will edit this review
