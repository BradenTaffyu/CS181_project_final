2023 product received for free as great as the main story and most relationship line major side stories are the world is utterly empty for the most part there is zero i m a student at hogwarts gameplay outside of 1 or 2 short cutscenes per class that s it your choice of house doesn t matter one bit your dialogue and behaviour choices are always the exact same no matter if you re slytherin or hufflepuff using the dark arts no one cares you can literally cast avada kedavra right in front of your professors and they do not even react let alone cause you any consequences whatsoever hogwarts itself while visually impressive to be sure has zero point zero percent sentient castle feel nothing there aren t even the iconic moving staircases they only fade in and out visually but they are nonetheless 100 static always connecting the same point a to the same point b room of requirement also is a major letdown as it has zero roleplaying value it is simply a room full of resource nodes and the vivaria are just the same sure for a few minutes it might be nice to watch a hippogriff young offspring frolick about but that s all you re getting the animals themselves are also just glorified resource nodes all you can do is brush feed harvest repeat ad nauseam the stuff you can summon both in ror and vivaria is also just scene dressing if you were thinking of actually entering that cottage you spawned in your vivarium think again if you thought you could sit down on those comfy chairs you just summoned think again same with everything outside of the ror as well think you could go to the great hall sit down at your house table and eat interact with friends npcs of your house etc think again the few things hogwarts legacy does well it does really well but everything else and especially the ending of the main story where your choices make zero difference with there not even being any epilogue to speak of it all feels very rushed and the game pretty much in all aspects aside from main and relationship line story fails utterly to live up to the potential that is there in abundance on top of all that there s the abysmal technical state affecting a huge number of players even on 4090 level gaming rigs and the fact that the game is massively shorter than what the devs promised if i hadn t gotten it for free i would ve honestly refunded it or otherwise felt majorly taken for a ride given that the game puts our legacy so front and center there s very little communication thereof while you play the game for the most part there are literally zero consequences to your actions it simply doesn t matter what you do or don t do if you use the unforgivable curses or not not even what you decide during the crucial final minutes of the story and as i said above there isn t even any proper epilogue nothing to actually show you how your choices changed the world around you i e what your legacy actually would be nothing at all and that leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste so much wasted potential this game could have been a true masterpiece as it stands i cannot in good conscience recommend it for full price
