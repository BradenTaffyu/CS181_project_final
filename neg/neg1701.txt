2022 drop the prices for the dlc s or you guys only care about money and that will be the proof if it wasn t obvious already 10 bucks for the expansions and 5 for the extra crap that should already be in the game or at least given for free i hate this world and the people like you guys who just suck your customers wallet s dry without feeling bad at all i guess if i was rolling in money i wouldn t care either probably made the game free to play because no one was buying the game anymore and so you make it free people jump in and boom you have them craving for the dlc packs expansions because the base game sucks on it s own all you guys hear is cha ching
