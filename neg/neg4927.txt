2020 i am a long time total war fan bought this game 1 5 years after release i played it for rougly 100 hours and finally i had enough on the technical side the game still freeze quit to desktop or just restarts your pc randomly but does it especially during sieges people have been complaining for it since release and looks like they wont fix it any time soon gameplaywise it have its positives but the negatives makes the game frustrating to play slow unit movement bug during siege battles have been reported to ca for a long time and no fix in sight infantry combat is basically non existent the outcome of clashes between units is unpredictable you can clash a unit into the same type of enemy unit that has been attacked with missle units for minutes yet your unit almost routes other times you have fresh troops on a hilltop yet the same kind of enemy unit can go toe to toe with it in a frontal attack cavalry and missle units rule the battlefield you only need 2 3 infantry units as baits for the enemy to blob on i like the romance style generals but the character types are inbalanced sentinels can easily kill any type of general in a duel you only need strategist beside them and only for the extra ammunition unique generals are cool but they rarely feature any unique abilities only increased stats sieges would be great expect you need to methodically destroy every defense tower othervise they would wipe 30 40 of your army alone even after they nerfed them it makes siege battles just a chore this game could have been a really great and polished game but the long list of bugs overcomplicated and inconsistent battlemechanics makes it mediocre at best
