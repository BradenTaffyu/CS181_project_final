2022 decent game but hard to recommend because 1 its difficult to get a lot of gems to open up packs unless a event is going on where you can earn up to 2k gems plus they need to reduce the amount of real money to buy gems from them because the price they are asking now is to much 2 some decks are just unbearable to play against due to the amount of negates literally faced a dude who went first and set up his entire board that negated any spell or trap card i would put down and negated any monster effect i could possibly use to the point it was useless to do anything even had a monster effect 3 konami needs to add more ways to earn ur points into the game because its hard to make any decks when you dont have any ur s to make some of them 4 a updated ban list would be great cause i can name over 2 dozen cards that either need to be banned or limited mostly limited 5 add a casual mode to the game and not just having ranked mode would be nice maybe tag team 2v2 would be cool 6 this may be a hot take but maybe adding a chat system would be good that way you can talk to people online in the game about how to do certain decks or how to play them to get better 7 reduce the time when its your turn i hate playing with people who take like 7 minutes to do things please reduce the timer pretty much my pov of the games state right now these are my opinion on the matter but hopefully some of the problems i listed can be addressed and soon
