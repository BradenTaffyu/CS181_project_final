2014 early access review as previously stated by many others this game has tremendous potential but it s also greatly lacking in content with correlations to its price the concepts are somewhat new and this is what makes it enjoyable but because of the lack of content the joy rapidly diminishes in the first few hours the game is too pricy at this point in developement i believe the price should be around 15 here are a few specific reasons why 1 there is only one map and although its quite big most of it is just terrain rather than interactive unless you consider dirt and trees interactive 2 not enough crafting there are an awesome amount of weapons but the traps tools and building blocks are lacking in variety the game features farming but there are only 3 different plants 3 bugs and glitches sometimes creatures are stil spawning in thoroughly lit areas when mining the blocks sometimes fly out or fall into space occupied by another block meaning it cannot be accessed directly without removing the other block when looking for multiplayer servers it does not correctly display the current number of players in the server 4 spawn trapping when you dont have any weapons or beds and you die during the night it is almost impossible to do anything without waiting till daytime the zombies run at you and deal relatively massive amounts of damage and they also spawn in waves 5 lack of instructorial information the interface is initally difficult to decipher and the lack of any tips reduces our learning to nothing more than just clicking a button and waiting to see if it does anything
