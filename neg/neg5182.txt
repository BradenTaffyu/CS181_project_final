2017 i m a fan of this game but i cannot recommend it for one simple reason you are buying a game that is blatantly lacking in factions it s shocking and appalling the level of dlc is needed that should have just been included in the original game it s really sad that i have to leave a review that s negative because of the cash cow mentality that has overtaken the total war seires as there is a lot of gameplay i enjoy about this game
