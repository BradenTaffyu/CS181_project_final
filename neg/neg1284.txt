2016 how to destroy a franchise ft bethesda a ridiculously bad game i can t comprehend how could bethesda up again even after obsidian showed them what they should do to make a good fallout the dialogue system which was one of the best attributes of past fallout games was completely destroyed you are limited to 4 dialogue choices which are basically 1 yes 2 sarcastic yes 3 no means yes 4 yes the lack of quests is disturbing the factions that you can join are all tied to the main quest with the exception of the minutemen with their infinite go and help some sidequests so basically once you finish the main quest you can either walk around doing fetch stuff or build some that will not change in the game there are no skills anymore no alternative paths to solve something no karma no hardcore mode the game is mediocre in every aspect but the shooting and explosions
