i had a certified essay typed out regarding my grievances with the game but then i realized it wasn t even worth it in short madden 25 is the least enjoyable experience i ve ever had coming from a superstar franchise only player while the presentation is the best it s ever been the game play is so bad this is the first madden game i will be retiring with this little playtime the offensive line issues in this game are abnormal to the point where it affects enjoyment i cannot stress how bad the offensive lines are in this game no matter how highly rated your players are there are 3 4 defensive linemen in the backfield consistently in less than 2 seconds in past games i would get upset occasionally at how fast my line would crumble under no real pressure but every past game pales in comparison to 25 it should be stated if you are some online ultimate team god who loves scrambling out of the pocket every play or reading defenses like a professional qb you ll probably be fine however from a casual fan s viewpoint this issue is so glaring i can t even enjoy playing the game if this is how new madden games are whatever ig but unless it s fixed i ll be sticking with the older ones ty for the trial so i can play my 10 hours and never touch the game again
