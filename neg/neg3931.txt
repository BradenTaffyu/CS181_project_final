2023 early access review i am writing this review as i do not believe it is worth to pay full price for a remake of a game which has so many issues at the start first they are hesitant to say the day in the trailer release then sudden it is said it will be on the same day they then make a mistake in the timezone conversion alright this can happen after that we got few delays as they were still compiling the game wait what on release hour still compiling the game finally after 8 hours we log in start building and suddenly after 2 hours all servers taken down because they forgot to disable admin bc people where getting admin and wipe everything the company is a joke you should not support a company that communicates badly and leave everything on the last minute other than that the game looks great but can be quite intensive on your hardware i said before it s worth half of the price but now i d recommend to wait until they fix their stuff edit gonna add the following there been some server issues and it is still on going now i don t mind to rub this under the carpet as in launch issues since the hype is real however they haven t given any updates while a lot of servers are being down for 3 hours and counting which is very aggravating the players edit 29 10 2023 a new update after few days which is mostly positive the support for all the bugs we encountered they do work through the weekend that s a good thing servers start to get more and more stable unfortunately still not fully ready currently you can expect multiple updates per hour now also about the game itself after playing and trying to ignore the bugs this is actually what ark supposed to be from the beginning building is way way better things snaps better even any other item can be set to snap or not like mortar and pestle on foundations you see more information as well and i love that they combined items instead of for every little thing their own recipe i also love you can see your taming progress from a distance which is very helpful graphics wise it is a beautiful game as well however it does take a heavy pc to run it currently i am running on 3080 on mixed settings edit several weeks later still they have not fixed the server crashes as if they no longer care i just cannot recommend this game as long they do not fix the game next to that i do feel like half of the crashes is thanks to their contract with nitrado nitrado can t handle ark servers is a fact but unfortunately it is not only limited to ark servers i read loads of complaints about nitrado in general come on wildcard fix these 2 issues so i can start recommending the game
