2018 game was really fun years ago before they started messing with the economy you used to actually be able to unlock things without suffering too much now several years after adding ground vehicles which i thought would replace world of tanks for me the economy is so awful with you making pitiful amounts of exp and credits and many of the vehicles have been gimped with awful initial components with high research prices to criminally incentivize you to just buy your way past many of them really fpe and basic repair kits don t come with tanks and cost a 3rd of the tanks value in exp combined with broken balancing just makes this not a fun game for me unfortunately its the only game i know of that currently offers the realistic experience that it does but i still can t recommend it because of the tactics the company uses and how they treat the community update it s been several years since i wrote this initial review in most cases i would say the economy is still trash and the general behavior of the company is to make new premium vehicles and new nation trees overpowered immediately after release and to nerf them over time to balance things out i wrote the review when i was still a poor college student and now i have adult money i ve started playing again with premium account still i find once you get to late war tanks the fun seems to go away and the balancing comes into question
