2019 great game but for as great as it is it completely destroys everything fallout was about dialogue is meaningless quests have no consequences just everything that you associate with fallout besides the actual theme of the game is gone it s not that it s a bad game it s just not a fallout game to me to put it simply if you want to play a good rpg go get new vegas if you want to play a good fps game get fallout 4
