2017 want to play a new civ with a brand new and pretty cool distric city planning system but all the same problems civ v had yet worse this is your game don t count on any fixes for the issues the game has either those are being saved for dlc that you ll need to pay even more for incoming apologists saying that you can t compare this game to civ v with 3 expansions i shouldn t have to wait an extra x years and pay 150 before being able to judge a game also preferred civ v pre warmonger and pre religions anyways featuring the same unreasonable ai that is completely horrible at warfare tactics the same religion unit spamming ai try actually doing this as a human player becoming a warmonger for defending yourself against a surprise war declaration warmonger status for that one war in 500 bc lasting until the end of the game not being able to do a non surprise war warmonger penalty without denouncing a civ and waiting several turns bonus you can t denounce them if they ve denounced you and they will continually refresh the denounce before you can the inability to destroy move districts around after you realize that they have a late game bonus to other nearby cities etc waiting 10s for the goodbye button to appear every time an ai wants to tell you something ai constantly offering trades that it suddenly doesn t want to accept bug that needs more and dlc to fix
