the game is great if you are able to play it or when you are able to play it the optimisation of this game is really bad as i have enough resources to run it over 100 fps ultra but the game crashes lag here and there i tried all the fixes and they aren t working at all i believe the issue has something to do with the save games as if i try to start a new game there is no lag at the beginning but as soon as you make turns in the game at some point the game will crash and exit if i open the game again and load the last save game as soon as i press turn the game crashes at the exact same move of the enemy i understand there are bugs and issues in games but the lack of support from the developers is a bit worrying as i saw so many requests for help from the players and i am not the only one with the same problem verdict great strategy game great graphics bad optimisation lack of support
