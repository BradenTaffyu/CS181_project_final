2016 i can not recommend buying this game no matter how much i like it deep down theres an amazing milsim to be found here but its plagued with decade old bugs and issuesarma 3 uses the real virtuality 4 engine which is a modern version of the same engine that ran the original operation flashpoint the way the engine handles ai physics simulation and your hardware resources are just abyssmal constant desyncs constant loss of your performance the longer you play no matter what your hardware you will end up with a choppy game experience its a shame really
