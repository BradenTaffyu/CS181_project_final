2019 cotw has never been without problems during its two year lifespan but as of late it is getting ridiculous the developers have put a heavy focus on releasing new content without cleaning up the mess they left behind them in the process that mess has now turned into a huge pile of problems and is guaranteed to ruin your gameplay sooner or later animals freeze game breaking animals teleport game breaking animals rubberband game breaking animals drop in form the sky right in front of you immersion killer animals disappear after you ve shot them game breaking animal tracks disappear game breaking some animals have the wrong sound fx immersion killer online features sometimes work sometimes don t annoying all these problems have plagued the game from the start but as content got added they grew worse it has now come to a point where i can t have a single hunting session without running into at least one of these bugs when the game works it is a beautiful experience but especially the animal behaviour bugs completely ruin the party and make you feel nothing but frustration since this is such a niche genre there isn t a lot of choice for you if you do end up buying the game you will have a good experience at the start it is when you get deeper into the game and its mechanics you start to realize this is nothing more than a gorgeous backdrop hiding a complete and utter mess
