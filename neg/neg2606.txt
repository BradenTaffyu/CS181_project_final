2017 it is a fun enough hunting game i do prefer it to the original game my negative review is based on it having a problem with saved game corruption following a game pc crash this is not the kind of game that you want to reset your character ever so my 50 hours ingame are just gone in my case since i do not feel the urge to log back in and grind up to the unlocked weapons i just lost it s the end of the game for me i leave this as a warning for others to figure out a way to backup your saves often or face the same frustration as i have
