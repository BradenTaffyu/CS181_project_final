2019 alright as a veteran of a dozen of crpgs and rpgs this is not enjoyable as an rpg i ve played the divinity os and went through it fine i thought it was a balanced and interesting experience albeit on the arcade y side but i did not let that bother me but this the story set pieces are wonderful the voice acting and the addition of the narrator creates a world that feels living and interesting but to get to those interesting bits you have to endure the horror that is the combat my first run was on classic mode since as an experienced player you d think i d enjoy it well you were dead wrong every encounter was as intricate and punishing as well as bum love you with rng i ll get to that later hoo boy it seemed like the game wanted me to grind to advance to certain story points i don t like grinding it should not be a part of any game in my opinion why would i say i needed to grind cause half the damn encounters leave you within an inch of your life with multiple team mates in need of a revival scroll all in all playing on the harder difficulties you can t just adventure as you will on account of the aforementioned the exploration is 98 trial and error trying to find the right encounters that you can actually beat at your current level so you can progress in the story which is 100 not what i look for in a story driven rpg i got to as far as the aeteran temple in driftwood after being stun locked and one shotted by the boss i gave up and lowered the difficulty now the game felt like i was living a part of another world and interested in the story without paying for more revival scrolls than actual skills and not being wary of every corner of the game world in the likelyhood that i would get one shotted and eaten alive it even felt challenging and i knew that if my party got wiped it was because i could have done better all that lasted and i enjoyed myself until the last boss then it s back to reload and retry with different tactics to finish the damn game which is fine by itself but not in this case the last boss fight another garbage fest of trial and error stun locks and one shots exactly what i was talking about when i mentioned the bum love you hard rng one of the last boss characters whom i shall leave unnamed in case of spoilers had 3 effects on my characters depending on savescumming one shot kill buttloads of damage miss i won t even bother using the resurrection scroll cause that grace affords one breath before one shot now you might say that i should min max level my characters the optimal way deal with encounters like this yadda yadda yadda well then it s not an rpg it s some weird fantasy themed to do list why not just do my leveling for me if from the dozens of options i have i seem to be clicking the wrong ones others say that the way to play this game is to cheese every encounter with your knowledge of the game mechanics well i ve never had to cheese and min max this hard in any other larian game once you ve learned how to exploit the game mechanics and understand the optimal way to level your characters put points in warfare your adventure will be as hard interesting and demanding as punching a small child if you like that sort of fun i recommend this game to you otherwise no
