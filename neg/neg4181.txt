2018 this is getting rediculous tti first you made me give a bad review to gta5 for your shady bussiness practices and now you take another one of my favourite games away i can t play unless i agree to be spied on and any content i might create you can claim it for yourself once again great job you greedy corporate trash damn it where is the gaming industry falling to just let us play our games and leave us alone go spoil some other industry hey hollywood is pretty rotten just the kind of people you should be comfortable with doing bussiness leave my favourite games alone ps the game itself is 10 out of 10 patch 1 3 i don t know if the game is better in 1 4 because i can t play without accepting the new rotten eula
