2023 gaijin has repeatably over it s consumer base for this game multiple times with their tone deaf ways of rebalancing the economy and their overall business model for this game in general the game is fun the grind and the fact that you are basically forced to buy premium to make any progress at all is not it is a true shame to see the path that this game has taken in the past 3 years but maybe just maybe the fact that the community is finally opening their mouths and saying something about this collectively took you guys long enough btw that the devs will finally change this for the better i have hope it may be misplaced but it is there if they don t fix this then the game is as good as dead
