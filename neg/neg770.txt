it s a fun game in many aspects however whoever made the decision to make the residents of every town so needy ruined everything even with defense ratings of 200 they still cannot defend themselves even went so far as to put them all in power armor and give them the best guns ammo and they still cannot defend themselves it s nothing but constant maintenance whoever made that decision should keep their ideas to themselves and never touch the development of any other games for the rest of their life
