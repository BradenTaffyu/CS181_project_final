2021 don t get me wrong this game is fantastic but it is absolutely unforgivable how square is treating the steam users and leaving this version of the game a broken mess while the microsoft version gets the patch treatment i never experience the issues personally but that don t mean they don t exist for others stop treating your fans like crap square
