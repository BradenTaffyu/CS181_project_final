2020 here s how your experience with ds3 will go if you buy it you ll get invaded by a hacker that injects invalid items into your inventory and immediately kills you the save system will trigger since you died and the game s servers will detect an invalid item in your inventory you ll then get banned a week later from online play because a cheater messed up your save file and as of today bandai namco has stopped allowing ds3 to be family shared so if this happens to you there is nothing you can do to fix your game do you want to be unable to play a game you played 60 bucks for online then buy dark souls 3 right now
