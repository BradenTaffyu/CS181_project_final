i have put an ungodly amount of time and money into this game when it first became free to play it was my first sims game so i had no prior experience or expectations and i did enjoy the game at first i started buying some dlc to have more stuff to do i liked creating characters and watching them interact but then i realized something i spent a lot of time and money to play dollhouse i listened to a community that had to wait several years to get basic features did you know this game first released without ghosts pools and toddlers you know staple parts of the series did you know it costs thousands of dollars to buy all the dlc to have all the content oh and some of that content that used to be in the base game is now behind that paywall and some of the dlc is basically buggy abandonware like dine out and my wedding stories don t get those packs unless you have mods to patch the bugs out the newest expansions which are 40 had a lot of bugs glitches and content issues like in for rent you aren t being paid rent oh and in a recent update you know get a pulsating shopping button on the in game ui so you can buy more packs that was the final straw i have never seen a company act so disrespectful to its consumer base this game is over a decade old and it doesn t hold a candle to the older games it actively pushes out as much advertisement as a mobile game full of microtransactions ea and the devs are playing weekend at bernie s with this aged system and expecting the players to be grateful for subpar content just don t do it find another life sim game for your own sake
