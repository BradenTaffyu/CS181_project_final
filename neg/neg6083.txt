2015 i would like to thank paradox entertainment for butchering their perfect game where at initial release the player had all the freedom they liked from previous releases 1 and 2 were easely modified by texteditor and the great graphical improvements from 3 adding the workshop for modders at 4 now thanks to dlc and updates completley stale if you like playing history games by following literal history then this game is for you if you think of purchasing an empire building game with depth and freedom in how you like to play it save your money and leave this game where it is adding mandetory colonial nations was their first mistake had it been optional no complaints community wide continuesly updating petty changes was their second and probalbly biggest mistake as with each update the modders had to either update their mod for every small change in the defines file or completley start from scratch again killing the joy of modding the game all together like me the fun was over after the 100th time i had to open the defines ini file to rechange a few lines because with each graphical update or other changes outside the defines file it would be back to its original vanilla self after each frequent update crashing the game upon reload of a save each and every time so i stoped playing for a while then when a few months later i think of giving the game another try i find it in an even worse state then before to find half the games mechanics have disapeared and the core itself extremeley unstable i m running the latest ati video card 16 gigs of ram and have a quadcore 3 2ghz that runs like an octacore but the game runs like i m back playing on an old pc from the 90s browsing the dlc s i find each and every part i miss in the core as a dlc its just a darn shame in my opinion as it was a perfect game to play and enjoy when it was released bugs and all
