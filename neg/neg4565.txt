2018 civ 6 is a game i really really want to like but just can t recommend in its current state the biggest problem is that civs aren t actually terribly different from one another and most games end up being exactly the same as the last one rise fall didn t fix any of the core issues with the game instead it added a bunch of mechanics that are easy to ignore loyalty is meaningless 99 of the time emergencies are completely ignored by the ai and just become an excuse for the player to declare war without penalties governers barely matter golden dark ages tend to make gameplay more homogenous since era score is too important to ignore wonders are still after thoughts rather than something to strive for on top of that they still haven t fixed the constant nonsensical interruptions form other leaders i don t understand what parameters they use for them but i ve had leaders pop up to yell at me about how i could let my civilization go bankrupt while i was sitting on 30 000 gold and making 500 per turn the next turn the same leader interrupts me again to tell me how glad they are that i know how to save money nor is this a unique example leaders rapidly and insanely contradicting themselves happens every single game the game needs a lot more than a few extra civs and weather effects to turn it into a game worth recommending and i just don t have faith that gathering storm can deliver
