2020 early access review edit callum of the dev team responded to this review claiming my post contained sexist undertones it did not at all i merely asked about the existence of mods affecting the balance of female lords i have copies of the posts and i am happy to show them to anyone who wants to see them i find this accusation extremely insulting and merely solidifies my motivation for giving this title a negative review and not recommending it with the community support in this state as a long term m b fan i d put this as a very good looking game with a great deal of potential however due to a poor experience i ve had with taleworlds that is posting twice that i d like to find mods which make the gender balance in battles more realistic less females in battle armour etc and both posts being removed despite being perfectly reasonable i can only recommend steering clear for now as such behaviour is beyond reproach let s be clear i am not at all saying that women cannot be on the battlefield nor that women are inferior or anything like that i am myself a stay at home father i simply wanted to seek a mod which reduced the prevalence of female lords in battle armour for that i had two posts removed and i suspect that any further posts of the kind will earn me a ban from the steam forums which is most unfortunate let s hope the message gets across at some point
