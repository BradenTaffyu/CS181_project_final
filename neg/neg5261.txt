2016 i can not recomment to buy this game at all if not worth any money and maybe the last total war title i ever buyed this game has a huge lacks of content only 4 playable fractions in the basegame thats a real joke i never saw a total war title with just 4 playable fractions today is the 16 08 17 and there is still no support for the german language next total war title i will only buy if there is support for the german language siege battles are worst battles i have ever seen tons of ingame bugs missing textures and so on the sally forth button was just removed from the game where are the civilians you are supposed to protect like we saw in atilla totar war they just removed them too they also removed burning buildings and every kind of city destruction shore and landing battles removed from the game attack a city from the sea is removed sea battles in general are removed too there is no point of holding strategic points like bridges because if you trigger a a battle near a river it will be a normal open field battle on campaign with some fractions around half of the maps are not even playable cause you game will crush while doing the battle or in loadingscreen unbalencend units flying units fly in slow motion you order and unit to attack and sometimes the unit just staying there and doing nothing and even if they attack after the frist charge for e g the enemy unit fall back and again you units just stuck and you have to repeat again again all siege maps look the same and even on open fieldbattle they have just a hand full of maps sega contunies the dlc madness all dlc are extremly over prized and lack again content 18 for one new fraction plus this game has a cap of dlcs after the woodelves dlc there will be one map dlc and one units dlc left and this game is finihsed warhammer ii is already in planing the complete game coast currently 120 so this dlc s could so easy be in the main game from beginning its all just cut content in my eyes and this is my opinion nobody can change that playing this game while feel for a total war players like 10 steps back
