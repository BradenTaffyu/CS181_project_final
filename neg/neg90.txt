2017 early access review this is how you died this is the greeting the player recieves upon initially starting up project zomboid this bold claim instills the player with unsettling feelings of paranoia discomfort and the reminder that death is inevitable both in real life and in the game project zomboid is a survival game which has the reputation for being incredibley realistic and challenging the players mood hunger thirst panick etc are indicated by moodles and can change the how diffucult it is to survive if you go to long without entertainment your character can become sad or depressed and you have to collect magazines or anti depressants to compensate some of these don t matter at the moment because of the removal of the npc survivors now there is no real reason to fear becoming depressed in game or choosing the short tempered trait during character creation not only that but there are a couple of other traits to choose from as well as various jobs the survivor may have had before the apocolypse that can influence the skill at which you perform in game in the early alpha stages of the game the main protagonist was baldspot through dialogue it is revealed that preceding the players introduction to the game your beloved wife kate was injured by other survivors during a raid the raiders took all of your supplies so now you ll have to look for the bare necesseties while fighting off the living dead and scavenging for a decent meal the dreary soundtrack kicks in reminding the player of his slowly creeping demise while scavenging the image of kate suffering in bed comes to mind as you find bandages medicine and painkillers to delay the inevitable on the way out after nursing to kate s wounds a shotgun wielding survivor demands entry into your home demanding your radio rations and medicine at this point in the game the player has a choice to make to risk everything by trying to kill the man or let him into your home if the player chooses to let the man into the home he finds your wife lying in bed vulnerable and with a wound on her leg he s convinced its a bite and shoots her and then you eventually the game had a couple of overhauls and they removed the npcs from the game which was fine honestly they said they would add them back eventually and i believe them the state of the game currently isn t as good as it can be the combat is terrible the stats are unbalanced and the game is now extremely unforgiving to the point where it makes the game less challenging and more or less repetitive when you think of combat in a game like this you think its gonna be fun and realistic right wrong i ve tested everything i could in the time i ve had in this game and every weapon in the game thats not the kitchen knife or wooden plank is terrible the way the combat works is when your in a fight with a zombie you swing at it and it gets knocked back a couple of feet repeat until the zombie falls on the ground and then hold space to start stomping on the zombie until it dies you can continue to click to use your weapon to attack instead of stomping but it doesn t make that much of a differenc and if you hold space you don t waste durability now there is a damage meter on all of the weapons and some have higher than others but none of that matters because when you hit a zombie with the wooden plank they fall down immediately so even though it does the least damage you would use it over the bat because it instantly knocks them down not only that but when you start stomping on a zombie like that it makes you vulnerable so if your attacking like 3 at a time your screwed this is were the kitchen knife comes in i you not there is like this insta kill parry you can perform with it when a zombie is doing the attack animation and you attack so using the kitchen knife skips the entire annoying knock on the ground and stomp mini game entirely and just kills them seriously i ve taken out crowds of zombies by just stacking multiple kitchen knives in my inventory the third best weapon would be the ax which most people who don t understand how the combat works say to themselves this is the best melee weapon it has the highest damage and is an ax the ax is third best because during the knockback fighting there is a small chance it will kill the zombie without knocking it on the ground a rare thing in this game with any other weapon guns are entirely useless because one day the developers were thinking to themselves let s write this thing called the sadistic ai because the zombies need to be harder so now zombies never stop chasing you i mean it literally like every zombie has some sort of unfair advantage to just constantly follow you and with your if one zombie starts following you now off screen other zombies can see that zombie following you and they start following you and then zombies see those zombies and start following you basically you can t escape these zombies its unfair i mean you can lose them sometimes but chances are your just gonna run into another crowd again guns are useless if you fire one your game is ruined they do the most damage but your character is literally retarded and can t aim worth starting out this is where the unbalanced characters come in in this game there is a points system to the character creation where you start with like 20 points to spend and you can choose negative traits to give you more to spend on positive traits typically this looks like i have hearty appetite so now i m gonna buy this one that makes my sprinting start off on level one the problem with this is that it assumes that your character in game if you didn t choose cook has never cooked anything in his life or if your character isn t a hardened veteran he can t shoot a gun to save his life it should start you out with average everything and depending on what traits you pick lower the average and raise others but it starts you out with nothing so something like aiming you ll never get good at because you aren t going to be able to shoot without attracting every zombie on the map and missing aiming doesn t even become viable until your like level 5 which is funny because if you choose the aiming perks you ll only be like level 2 or 3 assuming that when you choose veteran that your character has only shot a gun like once or twice before the apocolypse to prove my point if you give yourself negative traits you think will be bad like illiterate hearty appetite high thirst heavy sleeper etc you can give yourself all of the sprinting and strength traits and pretty much make yourself an unkillable beast that can sprint faster than a car and kill anything in your path that being said they can do a lot with this game but they take so long to update anything i m starting to give up on them tl drgames fun crafting and survival realistic combat is bad knife and wooden plank are objectively the best weapons and guns are rendered useless zombies have op ai where you practically can t ever lose them this was added recently however subject to change hopefully and the character creation is unbalanced because you can turn yourself into an unkillable beast who can sprint faster than a car
