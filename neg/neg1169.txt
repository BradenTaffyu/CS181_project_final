2017 this review contains spoilers for vanilla tl dr a good game but a bad fallout game storyhonest opinion the story sucks it doesn t really make any sense when looking at the core of it my mine gripe is it feels the plot twist that you were frozen for another 60 years not 10 seemed to have been added at the last second to make shuan father because between coursers showing up in kellog s memories who needed shuan s dna to exist in the first place and kellog not aging at all there are a lot of holes in the plot all this aside choices you make and do outside of the main story missions have no real impact to the outcome of the story your character is fixed on trying to find his son becoming a drug filled cannibal or living saint really mean nothing chracter creationit s certainly a step up from what i remember obviously mods add more flavour but without mods its still great however this all kinda goes down the drain because your character has a voice of their own on top of that they have their own background family and personality it indirectly really limits how far you can mold your character since they already have a background dialougethe dialogue is lacking at the best of times any given choices usually boil down to yes sarcastic yes ask for more money which means yes repeat yes and no compared to previous games skill checks have been reduced to being chance based so no need for certain levels of speech barter etc not like those skills were in the game but i ll get into that later there s also the case that what you say doesn t really matter you could choose the rude dialogue the npc will be upset but then be fine and dandy like nothing happened when you return to turn in unless you ve come back to kill them obviously there s also the case that you have no idea what you re going to say just a one to two word summary of what you will say not a big issue just personal preference gameplaythe game as a whole feels a lot smoother than previous games that s undeniable but it s so streamlined that it feels like a generic shooter with minor rpg elements gunplay is amazing no doubt the good karma bad karma system has been removed for the most part it s kind of there with companion reputation so your actions don t really have consequences unless you re caught perk builds also don t really matter at any point you can decide to branch out and generalize where as in previous games you had to more or less commit sure it goes both ways as a good and bad thing but on my second playthrough of the game my character plays no different from the first by the end since certain skills particuarly combar ones become mandatory in order to keep up settlements are whatever i kinda liked them
