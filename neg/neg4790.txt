2023 2 4 edit changed my rating from a negative to a positive i can now access the game again with no issues thank you devs this game is awesome and i hated not to play it for awhile i really would like to be able to recommend this as i have over 200 hours invested however at this moment i cannot i find it very odd that the release of hf2 coincides with the new requirement of existing players to accept a mystery eula the game game is unplayable since the complete eula is missing yet it wants you to accept it again and maybe it is just me but i find the timing suspicious
