early access review i absolutely love the pve in this game it s super fun and brutal especially with friends i m probably going to keep playing it because of this since you don t always run into enemy players that being said i cannot recommend this game with how absolutely the matchmaking is i m brand new level 4 character being killed by level 256 players that i don t care if gear plays a big role they not only have all 4 of their passives but at that level they have hundreds of hours hundreds of hours to learn the maps learn the game and get experience with the skill based combat new players shouldn t be matched with people who have hundreds of levels it s absolutely absurd fix your matchmaking
