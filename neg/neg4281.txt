2021 early access review this is a decent game however i cannot give it a recommendation yet factory games need to have that rewarding moment where you can easily almost effortlessly build i have reached the end game a few times and i find it miserable to keep the mouse clicking needed to build massive scale factories instead of wow i have progressed i feel wow this is just like the start of the game with 100x more mouse clicks blueprints and component delivery via drones would fix this another issue i have is that there is almost no real need to warp to other systems build spheres on other stars or generally explore also the english is just enough off enough to be annoying and the narrator is of a certain size irritating finally the soundtrack is just wrong i found it so irritating that i had to turn it off this was not the case with the other two big games in this category
