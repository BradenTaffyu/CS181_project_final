2016 early access review do not buy this game could be very interesting but development seems super slow many features were talked long time ago looks like there is still a long wait as of this moment its boring would not recomendjust look on other negative reviews all that is said about features and development process is true well its 2018 now and all i can say is d there is still no toilet flush systemedit 2019 september cant beleave i posted this review in 2016 the animations are still not released also got banned from their forum as well i mena is there anything else here to say edit 2023 guess what the game is still not finished it will soon be a decade in making its still the same with couple added features very sad make your own decision and they ban other peoples negative reviews like they did in the link above shocking
