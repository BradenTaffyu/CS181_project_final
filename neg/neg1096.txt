2016 in all honesty when this game came out i loved it did it live to the hype hell no no game ever does i enjoyed playing this game for the first few hours then it just seemed repetitive i kept playing in hopes that it would get better it never really did i honestly feel bad for those who got suckered in on the season pass it is certainly not worth it automatron and far habour are the only dlc in my opinion that were notable the rest of the dlc are tailored to which what bethesda proclaimed during the e3 showing was optional settlement building now with nuka world being the last dlc even though we were promised a ton bethesda hit a new low with this game you want a good fallout game play the first 2 want a more recent fallout game play new vegas
