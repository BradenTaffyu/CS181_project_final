2023 early access review do i recommend no why because all they do is reinvent the wheel constantly and after half a decade of it it s getting to be an issue when your game is all but turning into a different game constantly if you like it now there s no promise it ll stay that way the next time they update it they can t just stick with a system and flesh it out they seem to have the compulsion to instead throw the baby out with the bath water and try again leveling skills crafting recipes you name it and it s a system they ve completely swapped out at some point to this very latest iteration about to come out do i enjoy 7 days absolutely but once again i cannot in good faith recommend it to someone new with the very realistic scenario of them possibly hating it a year later when the devs swap out the systems they enjoyed about the game for a new system that they end up less than keen on if the day ever comes where the game stabilizes and actually settles on an identity then i would be more than happy to say otherwise also as an aside the fun pimps have a really weird obsession with waging a war against people that find cheese strategies against their blood moons and very much so balance their blood moons against them which throws the balance of regular gameplay into very weird territory at times for example they took offense at the idea of people riding around in a vehicle to ignore the blood moon so they made super vultures to chase them down which is a weird thing to get hung up on when no matter what you do if someone doesn t want to do the blood moon nothing could ever stop them from instead just stripping naked and running out into the middle of nowhere and not going back their base until daytime or turning them off entirely in settings
