2023 the game itself is very fun i just wish it had active pause so it wasnt such a stressful experience however i can t recommend the game because ubisoft makes you launch it from ubisoft connect a useless program that is buggy and broken most of the time and makes you wait 5 minutes to play the game because it has to launch then you have to log out of it because you attached this game to a new account you made when ubisoft connect forgot your old credentials and you forgot you had an account and made a new one only for ubisoft connect to suddenly remember your old credentials as soon as you make the new account and attach your game to it meaning you can only play it from that new account from now on anyway ubisoft connect is worse than 85 of cancers
