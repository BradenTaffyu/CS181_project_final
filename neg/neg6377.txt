2023 don t get me wrong i love horizon games i ve been playing regularly since 3 and playing simcades since the playstation 2 era horizon is a good game but it s also a game that has not changed in any meaningful way since 3 and 4 sure the handling characteristics have improved but what about the ai the glitchy physics the overpowered vehicles the bad lobby systems the world that constantly feels empty of players unlike how it was advertised etcforza horizon has become the widest ocean of a racing videogame with the depth of a puddle outside of those motivated by competition the game feels nothing more than an empty sandbox it s a pretty sandbox but the collectibles feel like pointless rewardless grinds the festival sights are still just un interactable fields of uncanny unreactive crowds there are no meaningful rewards in this game for dedicated players the showcases feel dull meaningless rubberband fests some horizon chapters just straight up let you cheat and some don t why i don t want to keep talking trash about this game because it s genuinely fun it s neat but it doesn t feel like a labor of love it feels like labor for money why innovate when recreating the formula saves money if i m being honest i think i would rather be playing forza horizon 4 because it runs better despite being on the exact same engine and it s now completely incompatible with some older gpus that could run 4 on highest settings and since forza horizon physics are affected by your fps since 4 also runs better the physics are also better the fact that we got seasons and then they just got rid of them the world in 5 does not change in any way nearly as meaningfully as 4 4 was ambitious compared to 3 5 is lethargic formulaic compared to 4 the hot wheels dlc in 3 slapped the hot wheels dlc here is mid almost feels like a nostalgia cash grab for 3 s players i m gonna keep putting hours into this game but sometimes i feel like i d rather be stuck in traffic than playing the most formulaic videogame i have ever owned tl dr it s a decent game but please do yourself a favor and mute the speech volume
