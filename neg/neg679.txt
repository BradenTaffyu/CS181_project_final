2017 mount and blade warband is a medieval rpg set in the fictitious realm of calradia where the player has journeyed to begin a new life and can aspire to become a noble lord powerful king or even emperor or well maybe just a bandit or something to play this you will need to have your own good sense of direction and i don t just mean on the world map however i m not too sure where all the hype for this game comes from it s certainly not terrible but i don t think it s quite as good as they say things i liked the dynamic market mechanics prices are always changing reasonably and are vary from settlement to settlement the traders and caravans do seem to have an impact on it to and all this helps make the game feel alive the game does well to emulate a feudal environment the king lord army structure is very akin to the historic medieval system while condensing the time constraints to still make it playable without having to wait a long to for populations and farms etc to recover there are bandits to be found in every corner of the woods mountains steppes and desert there are a wide variety of unit types to recruit and upgrade including viking units mongolian horse archer units egyptian mameluke units and even italian crossbow units obviously renamed and altered a little to fit the environment there is an extensive range of items for the player to equip and they all have a condition some swords have rusted and are therefore cheaper less effective while others are very well forged more expensive and effective the companions add a nice touch they are helpful and their squabbling isn t gamebreaking some of them don t like each other you equip and level them in the same way you equip and level yourself things i was indifferent about the graphics i don t really care about graphics as long as they are good enough these ones certainly are adequate although i think they are probably quite dated for today s standards the world map does fell quite featureless or bland in some places the feasts a mechanic that lets you get closer to chosen lords and families certainly necessary however i was expecting to turn up to a party yet everyone was kinda just standing awkwardly around the room and nothing progressed while i stayed oh well things i didn t like the starting stats i selected game poacher as a past career but when i got to battle my character couldn t even shoot straight in those times that would mean he didn t eat i guess i wouldn t have minded as much if they had simply put peasant because that s how effective they are at the start no matter what background you choose the combat mechanics the four hit areas are okay but the speed damage system seems very unintuitive and very inconsistent just when you think you ve got it that ai pulls a move that doesn t seem to be very valid e g i received couched lance charges in the tournaments there just isn t enough space to build enough speed for that there in my lordly armour i was still receiving 20 30 from hunting bows from chest hits when the situation was reversed i was lucky if i was dealing beyond 3 damage i got to 450 one handed weapon proficiency with a fast sword speed rating and the ai were still swinging faster than i was etc etc in combat literally everything seems to revolve around you for instance when you fight another lord he comes charging at you and is usually the first to go down while his army still hasn t engaged they are able to still fight the battle normally but woe betide you if you go down the battle ends straight away regardless of how many men you still have left when you would have completely crushed them you only get a bare victory also if the enemy is charging you on foot they leave their shields down to maybe go faster but the moment you draw your bow no matter how far away they are they all raise their shields and when you stow your bow they all drop their shields regardless of the fact that your own archers are nailing them the ai men are bricks you can t push them in any way except kicking them and they seem to automatically half step backwards when you try to kick them they are free to push you around as much as they like though to the point where they your own men knock you off your own siege ladders castle walls and even out of a cavalry charge it gets grindy and really repetitive after a couple of in game months if you have enough patience to get to the end game it s a little different but i found it got stale even after i destroyed the first faction i was fighting the missions are good at first but after doing them three times each they just become a grind the ai lords with significantly less renown are able to field significantly larger armies than you while only owning a couple of villages the end game is not that different from the start even as king all the missions are the same micromanaging the recruitment of your armies between villages moving them around you have to babysit them is the same and all the dialogue is the same so the big reward for being a king is just having the title of king i guess and being able to start wars heck at the start of the game you can talk to all the monarchs right off the bat which i don t understand you have to sink a lot of time into it to get going which i guess might be okay if i liked it but it is still a chance you won t get going as well i don t think the reward is worth the grind overall if i had to give it a number i guess it would be around 5 5 or probably 6 10 which i don t consider to be high enough to encourage people to spend money on it what would i recommend instead i guess that s the thing really i m not aware of anything like this at all unfortunately and yes i ve done the conquer the world thing landed difficulty 20 shots soloed and beaten 90 veteran crossbowmen got to max level etc etc
