2018 time is finally here and after 360 hours of playing this game and interacting with the community and devs on an almost daily basis its time for my review going to be honest and in depth i hope this may guide you in weather to buy the game or not spoiler i dont recommend it but if you dont mind al these major flaws and just want to play it for a few hours go for it the goodlet me get this started by saying my first few months playing carx were great it started off as a really nice and easy arcade drift game and having previously played carx on the mobile was very quickly drawn into buying itthe base its simple its easy to pick up and there s a fair bit to do as far as cars customization wheels paint parts smoke ectect a decently sized car list and use to have a very active modding community making the game stand out even more the badso all sounds good and well but the simplicity is very easy to grow board of lack of maps there s a small selection of maps in carx for the first week or two it was fun just nailing all the lines and exploring around to see what there is to find there s not a lot aside from some really really low poly cars and giant ground planes with no colliders or just barriers in general blocking logical places to go ontop of this when you ve run springstone for the 1000032789532578943th f king time it starts to get really stale sure you can drift kami but its the same problem again stale once you run it more than 150 times that doesn t take a lot of time to do lack of optimization this game in single player runs pretty okay i can get stable 60fps running of a gtx670 so if you re on a budget with a pc this game should be okay for single player but online is just so poorly done that i will frequently drop from 60 to 30 or less lag spikes when there s more than 8 or so people in a lobby which again with a dead community there s usually just one server running with 16 people 5 of which are afk 2 of those people are just trolling ramming and 3 of the 16 lagging so badly you can barely see their car on the track the community is okay if you know people for the most part lobbies will be chill there s a lack of trolls because you can kick people from lobbies but that doesn t stop them from spam joining over an over again but for the other part you re getting rammed into a lot of the time even tho you re running a clean and you bet once they run into you you will be flamed and voted for a kick the devsi m sure they all mean well and it pains me to say this because they probably work pretty hard and want to see this game go far but it doesn t feel like that sure theres an obvious language barrier between the english speaking community and the russian devs but after speaking to some russians about it even they don t get much information if any at all for them every question or suggestion for the last year has literally been the same yes we either know about this problem think this suggestion would benefit the game but can t give a time frame or even confirm or deny if its going to be in game the last several update probably since the start of this year have been random stock cars some good and requested some terrible and never spoken of some new kits usually just some over the top rice or just has options to remove body panels that look awful theres never a focus on anything it seems they just jump from making random verses modes and ignoring the fact the game runs terrible in a populated lobby the multiplayer desync all tho has improved a tiny amount completely ruins any fluidity of online tandems and whole list of other annoying and or game breaking issues they rather put more work into verses modes and porting over mobile dlc and selling it to us anyway this turned into more of a rant but you can ask around the near dead community a lot of people will agree with me
