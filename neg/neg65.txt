2017 early access review npcs have been in development for years now the animation update that was supposed to come out several major builds ago has been in development for years now there s still an absolute dearth of content other than smacking zombies and looting houses none of the story progression stuff or any of the more interesting gameplay mechanics like mental states actually being important have been implemented i remember back when the devs suffered a loss of much of the game s data due to a burglary i think and lacking an offsite backup and one of the devs went on a drunken rant on twitter i remember defending them saying that sure it was stupid to have only one backup but this game was shaping up to be the zombie survival rpg thing that we all wanted at the time several years down the line no meaningful progress has been made
