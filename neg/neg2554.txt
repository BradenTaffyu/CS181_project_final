love this game and all the reserves are amazing i love being immersed and just wandering around the hunt is so addicting so why isnt it recommended simply because of a sound bug that has been in the game for years and if the devs dont want to fix it i cant recommend this game until they wake up if you walk through a bush there is a high chance the bush sound will persist where ever you are even if youre walking down a road it will sound like youre going through thick bushes i was very annoyed with this bug when i first got this game a few years ago and am even more annoyed that in 2024 it still exists even after multiple dlc this is unacceptable and i wont be buying any more dlc until its fixed the devs act like theyve never heard of it theres no way the devs and playtesters didnt encounter this bug when literally everyone suffers from it no matter the platform and theres no way they havnt heard of it yet this bug isnt even on their website for known bugs the least they could do is acknowledge it on the known bugs list go ahead and search on the discussions here or reddit the bug exists
