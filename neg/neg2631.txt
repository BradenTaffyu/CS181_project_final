game is designed to become a microtransaction machine sure it can be fun but ultimately it s not free and the special events every time you get close to being in the top 6 the game kicks you i have yet to be top dog and the odds of a speedster being able to knock out over 2000pts of armor in 1 shot not possible but it s happened 3 times to me the ai in this game is utterly ridiculous 1 from 1 2 a map away they can shoot through a quarter sized hole in a wall 2 ai shots always blow out 1 2 your armor regardless of the size of your or it s vehicle 3 when ai plays the server screws with your shots your dead on closeup shot should straightline in but not against ai no no no your perfect shot will arc over towards the target like a slow pitched softball either missing completely or giving the target a chance to move tldr have your wallet open no really it feels like the odds are literally stacked against you if you aren t spending money to play plus the insistence on using ai without player s choice is really messing this game up
