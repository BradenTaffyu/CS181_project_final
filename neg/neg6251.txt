original review at first it feels fun and the unique progression system to get cards feels fresh and new soon though you realize it s just a hidden p2w system or it s a completely dreadful experience you get less and less resources to progress less and less currency to purchase progress and the missions are so limited and so slow to reload it s a joke card progression is broken into pools so you are limited to specific cards while you are progressing eventually you reach the next pool of progression but again the ability to progress is so painfully slow you can t obtain cards from the new pool but you start getting matched up with other players from the new pool who have cards you can t yet access and as you may have guessed the higher the pool of cards the better they are so ultimately you re left to bash your face in and if you don t don t worry the players with the cards you can t get because you can t progress will bash it in for you yes i realize there is likely a skill issue as well however when you are losing to decks with cards you have access to it s acceptable you can build the deck they are using you can try out different things to counter it but when you cross into the realm of oh i can t play that deck because i don t have that card and can t get it anytime soon over and over and over it becomes very not fun to want to progress compared to something like hearthstone yes in hearthstone you have to rely on rng packs to get you the cards you need but at least they have the dust system so you can breakdown cards you don t want or need and get the cards you do want and at least all the cards are available to everyone in snap you progress very slowly you reach a point where you get one card every 8 levels or so and when you finally do reach one it s rng from the pool you are in so it may or may not be useful and there s no recourse if it s not something you want the premise is fun and fresh compared to other card games i enjoy it i don t enjoy the progression system i wouldn t recommend the game but if you are okay spending or grinding out slow progress against opponents with a superior arsenal then maybe it will be a pleasant experience addendum after putting in nearly 10x the amount of time i put in prior to my original review my opinion of the game has not changed if anything it s become worse even after spending money it s pretty unplayable as a new player once you hit pool 3 obtaining cards in any type of sane manner is mind numbing at first you ll be able to unlock 2 pool 3 cards every 1600 credits slightly less if you have a bunch of commons to upgrade eventually that turns into 2 pool 3 cards every 2400 credits finally that becomes 2 pool 3 cards every 5400 credits without spending money you re looking at about 500 free credits per day plus whatever you get from the progression tree there are 109 pool 3 cards good luck to obtain pool 4 and 5 cards you need spotlight keys well you can get those once every 6000 credits give or take on top of that because the spotlight key takes the place of the caches that you get the pool 3 cards from that can add additional credits to the numbers i listed above spotlight boxes give you 3 possible prizes and a 4th that is a random pool 4 or 5 card so yes every time you open the cache you will get a pool 4 or 5 card but it may require you opening 4 of them to get the one card you want okay well maybe that s all a bit extreme because you don t need all of the cards to build a deck right sure however you do need a combination of good cards to build a good deck and all of these card unlocks are random you can also select 1 free pool 3 card every season month but they are on an 8 hr rotation so you get 3 options per day after roughly 2 weeks of waiting i still haven t seen one of the cards i m targeting this feels very unnecessary just let me select a card from the list of cards i m missing i can only do it once per month why in the world should i have to wait on rng shop refreshes i ll tell you why it s a predatory tactic to a frustrate you into spending money to try an get lucky and get the card you want by buying credits and unlocking more rng boxes and b to get you to keep coming back to the shop and looking at all the things you can spend money on because apparently the free 50 credits you get daily from the shop doesn t make you return to the shop often enough at the very least this should show 4 or 5 card options at a time for your free monthly choice finally some of the locations are mind bogglingly made up word stupid spend all this time and possibly money to build yourself a deck and then get hit by replace your deck with random cards or draw from your opponents deck most locations range from frustrating to freaking fun and add a dynamic element of challenge and strategy to the game however making it this treacherous to obtain cards and then taking them away from me makes 0 0 sense as i ve said previously in this review the game itself imo is a well made fun game i m sure it s a blast for people who have been playing from the beginning and have most or all of the cards however if you re a new player i d strongly recommend moving on and finding a different tcg to entertain yourself with
