2023 putting the game aside for now i ve played sims like this since the early 1990 s but it didn t mesh with me basically stopped at lower levels as i got bored as hell and it wasn t improving it s not like the many others over the years where you have to constantly react and build up to meet challenges you get a grace period between years to do most of your major work and basically sit on your tush after that if you played hospital it s basically the same theme with some improvements some of those improvements are for the better some make you wonder what was going through the devs mind when they implemented it you can reach higher levels on both workers and class levels but they raised it to the point that it basically doesn t make sense all you re doing is cutting and pasting the same rooms over and over especially with their dimishing returns where the classes basically handles 50 less and that takes up a lot of room and unless they have major league sized maps on the end you re just basically following the same theme for one type of class throughout your building or you re doing low levels trying to create a mix of classes to make the game more interesting it s as far away from hospital as you can get where you try to make enough money to max out personnel and equipment rooms treatment i actually fell asleep playing a couple times which is not regular for me so about 3 4 hours you can deduct from gameplay time personnel is basically the same way you got far higher levels you can reach but you ll quickly end up bankrupt if you try to push the max as your income is limited to students tuition and bonus more on this later buildings you can actually build your own no real challenge in that anymore except the issue of class level and what you re trying to accomplish pathing seems to have taken a hit in this game where you end up having students bouncing back and forth in front of classroom doors and you don t have the ability to pick them up to break the cycle so they ll keep bouncing until things get screwed up like missing class or they graduate it isn t common but it isn t rare either i ve had at least 2 incidents per game replay and i end up just saving game and reloading last save puts them back on track harder to ignore is the janitors becoming stupider then before i tried to post on the steam discussion forums but it got deleted not because it was a rant or used foul language but because they want people to create an account and post it on their website usually i wouldn t have any issue with that but i have too many games and i m not going to create an account for every one of them where i have an issue you sold on steam it s a common site for both consumer and devs then make use of it i posted to a drop box with video s showing the issues with the computer losing track of people and erroring as well as the dx error log and it got deleted within 6 hours i contacted steam with a copy of what i posted and they said there was nothing wrong to get deleted by them and they said they have no log of deleting it themselves as the devs have access they had to have done it according to steam so don t bite my head off as i m going off of what i was told one video was showing the ricochet rabbit action of one of the students the other videos showed full energy happiness janitors walking up to the room and turning around and going elsewhere allowing the room to become trashed and nothing getting fixed had the error logs for the specific video as well oh well not going to worry about it as the game as it stands right now isn t going to be started much you supposedly get more students then you got patients in hospital it sounds good until you think it through in hospital you had 200 patients cycling through when you push for that level of care gameplay you get around 300 students one shot at the beginning of the year according to posts i ve read making it seem like it can handle more when you build up to that level but due to how the gameplay is it feels like you re dealing with far less and with the dimishing return issue that i really can t see a point to it may be somewhat realistic but it s annoying as the game isn t a realism game it basically just eats up space with no real point having to create a bunch of unneeded classrooms that sit empty most of the time at the level i got bored with and exited out if they allow scheduling classrooms classes at far higher levels just disregard this section as i allowed my boredom to get the better of me before i reached a more challenging stage that allows you to maximize usage heating cooling is basically the same as hospital meaning it can be more of an annoyance then a help at times they fixed the gold certificate spam on university good so you can t just spam one item to get your room ratings up i regularly took every room up to 14 except the bathroom and the shower room even without the ability to spam trying to get to 15 looks like it would be a bear to reach but i didn t finish the game so i don t know what other things pop up later in the game to add for decorations that may make it easier in order to offset the continual income made in hospital they basically pay you the tuition to you monthly as well as a bonus from students improving or liking space they re in it levels up the university and can bring in funding as well i can see why they did it with the limitations as you only have the same customers for the entire year but it can be an annoyance especially if you re not throwing parties or bringing in live bands for them to give them an extra boost and shake the purse some more like i said i just can t get into it as my playstyle is for more interaction then this game has if i comment on a game i usually have hundreds of hours into it before i comment on it but maybe i ll jump into it at a later time and have a different opinion and give it another chance as i ve still got about 8 games and dlc s for games i already own i purchased at the same time as this that i haven t played yet i don t like to leave a game unfinished
