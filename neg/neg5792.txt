2018 rome ii was a great game until they decided to make it politically correct even if that implied making it totally not historical while there are very rare instances of supposed female generals in history most of these fall in the realm of the legendary or are examples of a queen accompanying a campaigning army in the rear the current state of the game forces the issue up your nose if you want to avoid having half or your general pool female you have to choose one of the factions that don t have the option which leaves half of the factions in the game out for you and even then you will be facing half or more of the enemy armies you meet led by females very historical if you do want to play as one of those factions you could try to bypass the problem by not recruiting female generals but that will limit your choices severely it may be that all your boys have bad quirks and only a girl is an option or you might run out of boys and be faced by an all girl roster want it or not rome ii has stopped being a historical tw game and joined warhammer as a fantasy game
