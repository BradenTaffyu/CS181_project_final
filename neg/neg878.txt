2016 i tried i really did i put more hours into this game than it undoubtedly deserved trying to squeeze every ounce of fun i could from the experience out of a desperate desire to capture some of that old bethesda magic that kept me coming back to the likes of morrowind and skyrim hell i can even enjoy a hefty bout of fallout 3 if the mood strikes but all of the issues bethesda has in terms of writing and gameplay are exacerbated here with none of the benefits character creation so light that it feels more like a post apocalyptic far cry than an rpg dialogue that ranges from tolerable to hilariously bad only this time made even worse by the fact that the speaking protagonist annihlates roleplay opportunities keeps me from asking questions that i feel any sane person would ask when confronted with numerous conflicts and destroys my immersion nearly every time i pick a lock or hack a computer while the combat has indeed been improved it came at such a hefty cost in terms of content and quest design that i d take new vegas janky firefights any day of the week improving your combat is all well and good but relying on it to carry your entire 100 hour experience is a bad decision if people found the radiant quests in skyrim obnoxious like me you ll be disgusted to find that not only are they back in force they make up about ninety percent of the game s content given even less cover than in skyrim where at the very least taking out a random enemy made sense when attached to bounty hunting as a career move having that be the case for literally every single radiant quest in the game is abhorrently lazy especially since you ll be doing them constantly no matter what faction you ally with and it s not like the sidequests or main quests are reprieves either while possibly providing the game with some much needed variety i found that nine times out of ten almost every quest i partook in followed the same formula go here kill all the enemies come back almost every quest is that the flavor text might change but the content does not and you ll see right through it if you have more than two brain cells to rub together i could go on but seeing how i ve put more thought and effort into this review than bethesda s entire team did designing their game i feel like this is a good enough place to stop tldr do not buy this game
