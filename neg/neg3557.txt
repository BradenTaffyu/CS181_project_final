early access review i ve been playing ark for years but i can no longer stand the new server provider my family has been paying for two servers for fifty dollars per month for only seven people why they insist on having only 20 person servers is crazy after the updates our files were getting corrupted nitrado support advised us to revert the server as far back on the backups as possible until it works despite the frustration and losing days of work this method has been working well this recent update has completely broken it to the point where when we tried this method our scorched earth server was erased as if we never played on may 4th even though we had the server for a month this server is where all of our characters and dinos we moved over were so they are also gone nitrado s support team has been unhelpful in identifying the issue and providing a solution that doesn t require us to do their job for them i was really excited about the new upcoming content but do not recommend it until they allow other server providers enough is enough
