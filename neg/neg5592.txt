2016 i was introduced to total war only last year and since then i have played medievil 2 shogun 2 attila and rome 2 of those i have to say rome 2 is by far the worst while it can still be fun the game is just a sloppy mess that tries it s best to suck the enjoyment out of itself we ll start with the good things the time period is fantastic this is rome during the height of their power not the shadow of glory that is present in attila you can re enact the war against carthage you can play as the ancient greeks or egpyt if you like or even try to reclaim alexander the great s empire as one of the successor kingdoms as i said the time period is great and the map size is awesome i love how at the beginning of the campaign there are dozens of different factions trying to fight for control of the ancient world and the game is still a total war game with all of the positive things that that entails now onto the negative the game is a broken complicated mess mechanics don t work as they should fortify stance giving you 50 reinforcement range no it doesn t units tend to blob up despite the use of a formation attack toggle morale mechanics are broken i ve had units at over 50 break and route even though they were winning decisively your general is useless he will always be one of the first troops to fall if his unit is attacked no matter what angle it s from sometimes units won t even follow orders i had a unit of roman cavalry that i was telling to attack a unit of enemy slingers despite the fact that they registered the order they stopped thirty feet from the slingers and stood there no matter how many times i told them to attack they just sat there until they finally routed from losses garnered by standing in the line of fire for ten minutes other battlefield mechanics make no sense how are slingers dropping my super heavy spear infantry locked in a shield wall from the front then there is the truly broken pikes you know your game has severe balance issues when multiplayer rooms are usually tagged with no pikes allowed because pikeman everything without a doubt i once had a unit of heavy swordsmen in a shield wall acting as an anvil for a unit of light pikemen i then hit those pikes from behind with a unit of heavy melee cavalry both of my units routed without the pikemen taking any significant losses the campaign map isn t much better buildings are overly complicated with their bonuses and negatives turning empire building into a game of hardcore addition and subtraction capturing territories is extremely slow because the public order system is designed to bog you down generals will pick up negative traits for idling in cities after only one turn the political intrigue system is boring time consuming and doesn t really have any effect on the rest of the campaign the entire game just feels broken this isn t even mentioning that half of the playable factions are locked behind a paywall so you charge me 50 for a broken game that isn t even close to the whole package then charge me an additional 35 to unlock the rest what a joke what makes this worse is shortly after i played this i bought attila attila is everything that rome 2 should have been which is even more upsetting because rather than fix the broken piece of junk they charged everyone good money for they went ahead and just made another game that actually worked and said sorry guys if you bought the crap that was rome 2 go ahead and buy attila instead it works don t get me wrong i m not hating on ca i understand that happens sometimes and since rome 2 they ve really stepped up their game look at how tw warhammer is shaping up not to mention that they re walking everyone through that development every step of the way i am however hating on everything that happened to make rome 2 the piece of that it is today this is the black stain on your record ca and you owe everyone by making sure that this fiasco never happens again in short don t play this either get attila or warhammer instead or go with one of their older titles those actually work overall 4 10
