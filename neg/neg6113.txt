2022 i want to love this game but it feels like 3 steps back from games that came out in the 90s where is stances other than stand ground why do your troops stop standing ground when you move them them 5 feet why are their no map overlays you can t see your military civ resources etc filtered on the map why do your troops scream and run in like the first rock from your treb hits a tower that you are trying to keep your guys safe from why is it so hard to notice when you are house locked no noise why is it defaulted to only show enemies as red why can t you see an enemies civ from clicking on one of their units why is it so hard to tell what you clicked on why is right click garrisoning a night mare why is there no town bell why do the units look nearly identical where are all the civs where are all the unit types why when you tell your infantry to attack someone near a wall they climb the freaking thing and stand their useless why do archers sprint past units to attach the one that is fleeing them why does this remind me of aoe3 in the worst ways and the sloopy troop movement of aom beautiful neat ideas like the abilities like hunting and carrying animals sheep only being kited by scouts unique building that add level of complexity to your game play and offer unique options honestly they took the control out of this game and gave you unique features that don t compensate every game feels like it ends the same trash would not recommend
