2017 turning mods into micro dlc s wow just wow it s bad enough when you buy a game knowing 50 of the content is already developed and locked behind a dlc paywall to be released on demand but when you start selling mods as dlc well that s just too far way too far i ve been an avid gamer for 15 years but if this trend in the gaming industry continues they way it s going i m going to need a new hobby the focus used to be around making a great game which then in turn made a profit warcraft age of empires grand theft auto s previous fallouts are just a few examples now it s just profit all profit this game is a prime example of how the gaming industry has largely abandoned making games that will make a timestamp on our lives and memories in favour of just milking the masses on the backs of a popular franchise and appeasing their shareholders as for the game itself the story side steps from one place to another so often i had forgotten all about the main characters actual motivation his her lost child also it is literally impossible to be evil in this game it does not have anywhere near the amount of decision making of previous fallout s i mean you can be a bit of an ass but nothing you say or do really seems to change anything in the story
