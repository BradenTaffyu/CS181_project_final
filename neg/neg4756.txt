2022 first let me be clear i actually do like this game the physics engine is solid the controls are intuitive and the custom content support is excellent so why do i not recommend this game simple the developers are permitting open transphobia take a look at some of the recent positive reviews and count how many of them paint trans people in a negative light do you really want to play with toxic people like that as someone with a lot of trans friends i certainly don t even disregarding the latest reviewers going fully mask off i ve noticed more than one person make sexual and sometimes outright racist comments in global chat i d consider those kind of comments a whole lot less family friendly than someone just mentioning they re lgbtq if it wasn t for the 4chan like player base i d highly recommend this title i ll be more than happy to rescind this bad review if the devs actually apologize and start permitting lgbtq talk in global chat while simultaneously moderating the actually nasty stuff i mentioned above but for now this title is getting a hard thumbs down a little edit i temporarily left comments on just to see what kind of reaction i d get just as i suspected a lot of commenters left stuff along the lines of cope and seethe really illustrating the kind of community this game has fostered you all just proved my point i ve seen enough and disabled comments but i did get a screen snip for future reference
