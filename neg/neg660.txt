2019 initially i loved this game i liked the challenge of building a deck that could survive all the myriad of enemies but then it got to the point where i realised that the game frustrated me more than it provided enjoyment so many options that seem nice are traps and they bite you hard as soon as you start to identify how each bonus screws you over down the track you realise that unless you get a perfect roll of the dice your deck actually gets weaker on each floor you pass and it kinda just sucks after a while i d say 7 10 runs end with a case of guess i ll die because of some random effect forced upon me 2 10 runs end because i done goofed and the last 1 10 runs i can actually scrape through might be to some people s liking but i d much rather lose to my own incompetence than random events
