2020 in short stellaris is a very good concept that s bogged down by a few big problems others have explained what they like about the game in detail so i ll stick to the reasons why i ultimately disliked it 1 as others have mentioned the ai is very bad this problem manifests in various ways i it forces the player to do monotonous amounts of micromanagement ii it makes the ais uninteresting to play against it s pretty common for them to declare war without provocation then send their fleet against your base that the ai has no chance of winning against iii it s unrewarding to inherit planets from the ai since managing the garbage heap of a planet that they ve produced is often more trouble than it s worth 2 combat isn t particularly fun and the alternatives are worse i if you re playing as a pacifist then all you can do to try to keep the other empires from tearing each other to pieces is to give them obscenely large bribes in order for them to join your federation ii if you re playing as a militarist then the combat is surprisingly unrewarding part of it is that the bad a i undermines the strategic challenge the other part is that fleet and ship control mechanics aren t sophisticated enough for a proper rts experience so unless one player is using some really screwy ship designs whichever fleet has the higher combat strength which is automatically estimated and displayed is going to win 3 the mid and late game drags i even with recent updates to improve performance the game becomes very very laggy as the campaign progresses ii there just isn t enough to do after the exploration phase i e roughly the first third of a campaign ends at least single player campaigns 4 the game is weaselly about dlc there are ui elements that hint at or in some cases directly refer to features that are dlc exclusive there s no indication that these are dlc exclusive either leading to much disappointment when you find that the thing you ve wanted to do or build all campaign long is inaccessible unless you cough up another ten or twenty dollars while there were some aspects of the game that i liked such as the ship designer society ethics systems and more the flaws that i ve listed are significant enough that i don t reccommend it at the heavily discounted price i got it at let alone for full price i daresay that even if you can get it for free it s not worth your time p s on the other hand my familiarity with the game let me have a good laugh when i encountered this video youtube video every stellaris run in a nutshell views 7 457 891 i ve always wanted to use this song for something and paradox gave me the chance always happy to plug one of my favorite genres of music filk
