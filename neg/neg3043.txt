2018 from a racing simulator point of view assetto corsa is brillant however it is unfortunately far too reliant on dlc packs i e most of the cars you actually want to drive aren t included all of which makes it pretty darn boring unless you re prepared to spend further on something you ve already paid for in the first place for that reason i would not recommend it and i have owned it right from the start of their beta release simply put the game is not worth the price tag without dlcs
