2020 brilliant game when it first came out match making was easier than ever before and the new graphics i added the 4k pack were a real upgrade from a classic now the issues start when lockdown began and all of a sudden the issue began i assume volume of traffic related when playing multiplayer vs players or ai the game started fine then after a few minutes you would select a unit to do something and there would be a massive delay before they started doing what was requested it started as 5 10 seconds and then kept taking longer the longest delay i could be arsed to record was 8 minutes this makes the game totally unplayable i only tend to play online vs friends and now it is so unplayable i have had to ditch the game come on devs when it works i would recommend to anyone a brilliant second remaster of one of my fav games with the current issues if you hope to play online do not purchase it waste of time the devs were alerted about this problem at the end of feb 2020 on their own forums and as of writing this mid may 2020 no one has even replied from the dev team never mind done anything about it big sad
