2018 early access review game keeps getting worse and worse each patch i started playing this game during a15 at that time the game was quite fun the skill point system made sense and you could focus your skill points into specific categories that helped your team out then a16 came and changed all that you could no longer focus your skills minimum level requirements to unlock skill tiers meaning it took much longer to achieve goals when working as a team the game became very grindy the electrical system was nice but means that you need to run ugly wires all around your base just to put up a few light bulbs a17 came and added more cars the game needed more cars but the skill system got even worse and the game got even more grindy zombies do insane damage to blocks tearing down walls in a matter of seconds the claw hammers takes too long to upgrade blocks as long as the stone axe did in a16 and your stamina runs out too quickly accuracy is significantly reduced when day 7 came the game spawned over a dozen radioactive feral zombies and totally destroyed our low level defenses in seconds this was on default difficulty you should never see hordes of radiactive zombies on just day 7 when you are likely to have mostly stone arrows and just a few shots for a low level gun game is broken if this game continues on its current path a15 good a16 bad a17 unplayable it will truly be a disaster
