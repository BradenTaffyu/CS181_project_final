played for fun stopped playing it for the same reason card accusation feels like snap devs are doing as a favor they will introduce a card and when people spent there money and buy it they will change its text mobius and alioth are the prime example the game itself is a gambling simulator monetize as a card game i dont mind spending but even after spending money you are not guarantee to get the card you wanted unless you buy tokens for worth of 100 500 bucks but hey this new card that i got is worth more than a new gpu that i could have possibly purchased
