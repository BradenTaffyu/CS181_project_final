2016 alright i know every review coming out in the past week or so has been saying the same thing but i just have to add my two cents this is the first time i ve ever felt compelled to actually write a review for a game good or bad ca come on guys really i love the tw series absolutely love it being a history major and a gamer it s like a match made in heaven but the fact that consistently and without remorse you just over your whole entire fanbase is abhorrent i was okay with the dlcs and stuff for shogun 2 maybe not the blood and gore stuff i started to get annoyed with the dumbass dlc in rome 2 sparta and athens behind a pay wall and blood again the ca but this this is when i draw the line 20 bucks for one single race and a mini campaign i can get the shogun 2 fall of the samurai for just 10 more dollars at least that changes shogun 2 drastically from the base game this eh one race that should ve been in the game to begin with warhammer is just a rich and fantastic setting especially for a tw game but of course knowing ca and sega they had to just cut it up and shove it down our throats at outrageous dlc prices i want to play as the beastmen or the skaven lizardmen dark wood elves tomb knights but no i m going to have to spend 100s of dollars in total to play as all these amazingly unique races factions i don t even know if i ll ever buy them i m seriously doubting contributing any money to you guys again take a hint ca and sega and just stop this abysmal dlc practice
