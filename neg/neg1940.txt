i ve never seen devs make such a great game and at the same time treat it like they take the communities advice feedback and turn it into incorrect manipulative garbage those who give reasonable advice get banned off of the forums and those who are genuinely trying to help improve the game are treated like enemies the game always feels like it s never dev tested and major updates always lead to incorrect models and insane bugs there are areas of this game which are borderline impossible to play effectively and have fun with for example playing strike aircraft in air realistic battles feels like a wrestling match between john cena and a young child you are the child a dedicated mode would be both easy and a drastic improvement to the overall game play for strike bomber aircraft the higher ups in gaijin also try and push their agenda down everyone s throat they keep trying to find more and more ways to squeeze every penny out of their players despite them already making bank on their players just look at the amount of premium vehicles which have been added in the last few updates israel has received premium tanks for the last 2 3 updates despite having a skeleton crew of a tech tree premiums fill the high tiers with brain rotted and toxic players they are ruining the game gaijin also has the worst group of mods i have ever seen they most but not all of them are straight up disrespectful and oblivious to most interactions they also like firing their respected employees in the most scummy ways possible i hope that whoever it is at gaijin who are being ignorant bastards figure their out or that they receive the boot p s this is my second account which is attached to my main i have 2000 hrs on my main
