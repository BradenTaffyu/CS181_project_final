2019 early access review if you have played project zomboid since 2010 2011 on desura you would have been annoyed by now this is not about speed up it is simple request like many more they promised npc all the way back in 2012 i was realy happy and waited exciting it took almost 2 years before they even wrote on a little place in the forum that they not gonna make it before close release that is 6 7 years ago since that the game have been smoothing a bit added more map driving and seasonings but seasons and cars got made by modders so sadly they have only made more maps and bit more smoothing that is everything i have got out of 8 9 years of waiting a nice game that fast get boring because either u need to play online and everything feel unrealistic with lagg or else u can play alone repeatetly over the years and get boring now they have shown nice videos and screen shot for almost a year about the new update but still not even close to a answer when it come out edited 27 september 2019 the developer keep prioritize in the wrong way they keep showing stuff that first is done in years they keep making 100 stuff that maybe or maybe not gonna come out in the feature the reason for my negative review is the way the developer keep start making features that they hardly can found out to finish everytime they start make a feature and its get hard they stop and change new direction sadly the developers never tell you when its get too hard they instead show everything they make making it sounds like just around the corner all these nice stuff gonna be part of the game they showing stuff and features along time before they even know if they can figure out to make it done instead prioritize 1 thing at the time they focus on way too many if you try ask the developer to consider finish little of the new features at the time they only answer very negative way developer fix the multiplayer for real make it work without too many bugs and lagss make a official server hardcore to make more players start play fix the newest update that have been going on for over a year without any test for alpha members fix the npc to make the game more alive it dosent matter they not are perfect to begin with continue changing direction without finish anything is realy bad try for 1 time sake to realy make the game enjoyable almost anything that need to make it fun is already part of the game so little is needed to change the experince of the game alot do that instead keep showing stuff that maybe or maybe not gonna come out in the future
