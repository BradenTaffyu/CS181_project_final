2019 just like any other paradox game gets released with bare bones functionality then gets dlc that adds features that should have been in the base game and the dlcs cost 50 of the base game so if you buy them as they come out you end up paying a lot more than you should have if you buy all the dlc in one pack its a better deal but still you shouldn t be forced to buy dlc to have basic features that should have been in the base game
