2016 you can find the best online races in iracing however it is expensive as 75 per year 15 per track 12 per car tracks change weekly so if you want to be able to play every week you have to pay 12 for a car 8x 15 for every track in the season that s over 130 not including the monthly fee just to be able to race in one series for 3 months thank god they change the tracks every season so you will have to keep buying until you have basically everything now if i spend a fortune to be able to use the service i would at least expect some sort of performance but their website which you have to use to join races or do almost everything else is the slowest pile of garbage i have ever encountered every click takes at least 10 seconds until you see the desired effect it is like battlelog for battlefield but 100x slower and with a clunky and ugly interface furthermore driving feels like you are driving on ice the force feedback is really bad and once you realize damn i am about to spin it is already too late in games like assetto corsa rfactor 2 and automobilista you feel what the car is doing and anticipate in iracing you can simply react and hope for the best the only thing iracing got going for it is the clean online racing races are competitive close and fun but my god they make you jump 20 hurdles until you can finally enjoy this game once you are finally on track and only have to deal with the bad force feedback it is enjoyable but it is certainly not worth its price tag one can only hope that their monopoly on clean online racing will collapse someday because right now we are stuck with only one mediocre expensive and annoying solution
