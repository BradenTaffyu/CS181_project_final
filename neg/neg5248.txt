2016 hello i became a fan of total war games in 2003 after releasing the first rome and the game really sucked me in i bought almost all the games and add ons well let s not get distracted what captured our hearts in the past parts historicity beautiful fight animations full immersion effect i was really looking forward to this part but i was expecting it with great caution and this is what happened pros new types of unique units simplicity for new players setting for fantasy lovers there are many historical battles created by the developers some of them are interesting some are not and some are very similar to each other improved leveling of the commander beautiful onslaught of units beautiful graphics especially the armor separate units heroes which are useful on the battlefield although sometimes cheating new gameplay although a little simplified a good game for those who want variety and are tired of playing for people cons a very strong simplification of the game such as horsemen cannot dismount a stupid system of alliances and wars everyone declares war then in a few moves they pay money to end the war there are no naval battles the government is too simple there is nowhere to develop strong units are immediately available to everyone as well as buildings that do not differ from each other combat system we returned to the distant 2003 because the combat system has catastrophically degraded and is almost the same as that of the first part of rome no battle scenes for small towns immortal commanders it s like watching a cartoon the troop animations are bad you are engaged in recruiting troops skipping a turn and fighting pumping up the hero and again units fly away tens of meters from cavalry attacks but then get up and fight as if nothing had happened there are many bugs and errors in other players as well as in mine when starting the battle units froze and i could not start the battle fps drops in atilla i could set everything to maximum without lags but here the fps just drops at high settings units have the same abilities and they are almost indistinguishable from each other very poor balance some heroes have cheating abilities to fight with someone there is no need to plan anything hire a larger army skip a few moves and attack other states there is not enough content at the beginning of the release then in order to play normally and enjoy the variety of units and the game you will need to buy dlc units take ladders out of their pockets the note what was a total war for me this is when i sat on the legendary difficulty level and spent half an hour on turn 1 planning the development of the kingdom on the battlefields you watch people fight desperately saturated with the spirit of battle i can t even believe that i m writing this about developers like creative assembly but by buying this game you re just throwing money away maybe it will gain popularity in online battles this is the only thing that can save this game as well as patches i will skip and wait for medieval iii
