2023 i can t recommend the game in the current state for several reasons even though it s a total war game and i really want to like it 1 the devs push out updates to literally remove features like chat and break all mods again in the process 2 this game is very hard to mod properly and even if you re careful you never know if bugs or performance problems are creeping into a long strategic campaign which is supposed to be the core of the game 3 ai is extremely flat and doesn t even build out its territory properly in the base game look at the second triumvirate as pompey sextus if you have the game or can a classic example and what really convinced me on this point is seeing how octavian didn t even upgrade his starting area ridiculous basically if you survive the first 30 turns of most campaigns there isn t much real opposition after that if you do an actual build 4 i am beyond sick of companies that do whatever they can to crush gaming and take the fun out of it they even had the audacity to recommend that people move to discord when it is closed source enjoy being spied on 24 7 and doesn t have freedom of speech on it i guess letting people chat with their friends is automatically wrongthink now or whatever i don t keep up with it but i sure can t stand the behavior
