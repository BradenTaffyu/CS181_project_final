2022 bought this thinking it d be similar to aoe3 but its was nothing in comparison i am not big on multiplayer an due to a extremely short campaign the game overall has left a sour taste for me the only updates i see occur are for only ranked multiplayer no expectations for more civs more campaigns solo modes on the horizon unless you want to play against people who ve been on this grind for years i wouldn t recommend aoe4 now aoe3 that is a more solo friendly game with even more features in which is far more reccomendable
