2019 a warning to anyone who might consider playing this game stellaris changes you will buy one version of the game you will grow to love it you will spend a thousand hours lovingly shepherding your creations as they grow and flourish and spread throughout the galaxy you ll buy one of the expansions and enjoy it so you ll buy another and soon you ve got them all and then the next major update will drop and the fundamental gameplay will shift elements that you enjoyed will disappear interfaces and uis will be reworked often in baffling ways seemingly just for the sake of change the force behind this is not mysterious once you have bought stellaris paradox has your cash you re not going to buy it again therefor catering to your experience as a player is no longer a profitable proposition to them so they ll rework the game to try to entice other players and in doing so they ll change the product that you purchased but that you do not actually own once upon a time i loved this game i gnashed my teeth and just ignored several feature updates that just made the game worse and worse by my standards i kept at it until the le guin update at which point i uninstalled sadly purged my saved civilizations and moved on buying stellaris is like getting into a relationship with someone who has already decided how they re going to break up with you
