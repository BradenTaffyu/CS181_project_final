2016 simply put stellar is dull empty it has promise the promise that paradox will fill out the game with a series of 5 15 dlc but as is the game is little more than a shell you start out alright exploring investigating developing then blob don t blob whatever you do it s boring with no diplomacy not politics no internal storylines stellaris as is is just a bore
