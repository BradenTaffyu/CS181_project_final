2018 i d love to recommend the game because some of the improvements in mechanics they made in this were excellent but the plot and its execution were severely lacking so much that in a rpg it fatally poisoned my perspective of the game and brought me to genuinely dislike it keep in mind that while most of this is subjective i feel it resonates with a few of the others that critique the game negatively or in such a way where it falls short of their expectations if you do not want spoilers explict or in context read no further to start the main plot arc itself is incoherent and boring there was no character development not even as the player s role in the story nor real attachment to any of the supporting characters themselves with few exceptions i e danse and curie while certain character concepts seemed to have a promising role most involvement presents to be superficial in execution and incredibly pained the story is awkwardly forced in many ways from how you re suppose to care about your spouse and child but minutes after meeting them they both presumably die this wouldn t be inherently terrible if the sum of the main character s grief wasn t confined to around twenty lines of dialogue in the story with miniscule emotion you d think that as a mourning husband or wife there would be more remorse for your beloved that was murdered before your eyes in cold calculating brutality but the first time playing this on release i openly laughed with how quickly the player s character ditches his grievances and carries on with the world the execution of immersive story was so sub standard that duke nukem forever seemed superior in illiciting a response out of the player and as a gag game at that none of the actions you do as the player seem to truly make an impact you could repel raiders from a town and life carries on afterwards as usual minutes later after people watch one another die the world seems hollow nothing connects between actions nothing seems to affect the inhabitants of the area the largest focus the game has is in the gunplay mechanics and saturating the area with enough hostile npc s to keep you distracted the concept of politics between townships and factions are veneer thin the lack of interaction between each faction and their inability to affect on another without the player involvement emphasizes with how hollow the world feels between them raiders randomly spawn and kill or die by randomly spawned mobs raiders outside of scripted events don t contend with other raider factions factions outside of scripted events and random spawn engagements don t actually take or lose assets and territories and what actions they do have against eachother don t affect the player in any meaningful way everything in the game is just there for the illusion of life in the wasteland and won t meaningfully interact with eachother in the environment what good is it to have factions if the factions can t holistically interact sure a bos or minutemen squad will duke it out with raiders or eachother but they never take territory they never make or lose progress helping either of them has only artificial impacts in relations but outside of scripted plot points never makes a difference you could wipe out entire hostile settlements and it makes no difference in the plot if it wasn t an objective to it the player as a faction leader can do little to nothing to influence their faction or how it operates even the role of being a leader is laughably the most worthless in the game as somehow you become the general knight savior or any other influential figure you are treated by all as the common footman you have no decisions with the institute to keep replacing wastelanders nor use their technology to better other s lives you cannot influence in any meaningful way the way they operate or are involved with the wasteland as the leading authority in the faction you have no authority i could go deeply into the gunplay mechanics or physics aspects lel lasers have recoil but the worst sin of the developing team sums up into the plot development means nothing to the plot nor player and for a game listed as a role playing game it honestly falls far from delivering as one i liked the base building concept i liked the modularity of items weapons armor the character creation the skill development though being able to get all skills seems kind of unchallenging but above all else i bought a rpg to play a rpg and got something much different instead pick it up on sale
