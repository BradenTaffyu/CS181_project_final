2022 garbage for years and years the devs have no love no passion no interest or ideas to improve the game we have been feeded 2 min cinamatics for years with the deception that they were expansions they announce a expansion which provides nothing new besides 5 min cinematics and 1 single fp dungeon while advertising that the 7 0 release would be a major release with new features new planet new daily area or op raid almost nothing was delivered as advertised hyped or promised and the features that we got are totaly broken beyong measure people have been give them feedback for months before the release and no action was taken the 7 0 release is a disaster ui specs systems that used to work fine in the past got totally cripped with the release for years swtor it s been on this path of life suppport maintance where they drip feed the player base the minimum and cut content so they can extend the subscription period by releasing the parts every few months apart since 2016 it s been like this devs have no love for the game no passion to improve things even when the players give them concrete and accurate feedback garbage
