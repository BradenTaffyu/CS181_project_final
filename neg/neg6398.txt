the fact that i bought the most expensive version of the game and don t get the new dlc included makes me wish i haddent wasted my money the fact i bought the premium edition and don t have every add on is disappointing its just forza 4 but some how the multi player is worse than 4 which is amazing and most of the races are indistinguishable from each other
