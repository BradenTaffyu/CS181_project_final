in 2016 17 i would have said it was a game with huge potential and unique mechanics far behind any competitors in all aspects now it s an outdated buggy game with a lack of balance and normal innovation for a few years now the maps are terrible the graphics are terrible the gameplay is terrible the interface is terrible the game may have looked great for 2013 but there s no point in playing it now for a newbie without global changes war thunder will soon lose its community and close people are tired of empty updates with a lot of clones and donations instead of useful innovations people are tired of maps and those clueless people who make them people are tired of imbalance and toxic new tanks planes and helicopters the game needs a complete rebalance work on changing the visual part of the game reworking the interface and controls reworking all existing maps and a normal attitude to its community greed killed war thunder48 52
