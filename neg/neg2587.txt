2021 2 10 yes i play it sometimes but no i don t recommend anyone buy it this is a hard game to review the problem is of course that there are very few competing games of this genre which makes it easy for devs to get lax in their quality control consider this there are nearly 50 different weapons in this game including rifles shotguns pistols and bows and every single one of them has some kind of immersion breaking graphical problem it may be the reload animation it may be grossly obvious clipping issues or how the gun gets chambered incorrectly how it ejects tipped rounds instead of spent casings or how every arrow breaks in exactly the same way after a single use i am not exaggerating here every weapon in this game without a single exception is absurdly broken in some way or another meanwhile every map looks like a really stupid ai designed it with elements like grass and rocks hovering so high over the terrain it s beyond comical furthermore animals are completely oblivious to each other s presence bears and deer walk side by side something players have taken issue with since the game s initial release more than half a decade ago and the devs simply don t care why there s no true competition there s just no reason for them to put in more than the absolute minimum amount of effort to release one lazy broken dlc after another but yes i sometimes come back to this game i play it until i once again reach the point where i can no longer stomach the grating sub par experience the sad reality is that there are no good hunting games available today this is the best one and it absolutely sucks
