2020 another failure from paradox could have been a great game but once again avarice gets in the way of art in the form of the paradox dlc policy the base game that costs a full 40 is so devoid of content that it feels empty almost no countries have decision trees which means they are basically unplayable already there is dlc for a combined price of 129 85 of that is expansions which often feel like glorified bug fixes and things that should have been in the base game like decision trees for countries another problem is the fact that the updates that roll out to everyone when a new dlc hits the store have a tendency to break the game for players without the dlc an example i personally experienced is that changes to the spanish civil war made my vanilla game broken for spain since a cleanup event that fires after you end the civil war fails leaving me with 45 worthless special event army divisions that i cannot change or disband don t buy paradox games until they change their sh tty dlc policy they don t care about making good games they only care about milking you for all your money
