2022 it brakes my heart to say this but i can not recommend this game i love aoe aoe 2 was not just my first aoe game but my first pc game entirely as you can imagine i have a very strong bond with all the aoe games when i found out that aoe 4 was in development i was over the moon when it came out i played it and loved it but from the beginning there were things missing or different little things that i convinced myself were no big deal or they were going to add it in later so i just needed to be patient things like being able to use cheat codes i always loved the way the story s were told in aoe 2 the art work the voice actors it was all a big part of why i love aoe but now it s like all they care about is pvp my dad has over 20 000 hours loged in aoe 2 never played a single pvp mach here we are though the most loyal of the knights of aoe the solo players who have kept the game alive for almost 23 years pushed aside to appeal to a different genre of gamer aoe was always a single player experience first and a multi player experience second i hope someday you guys remember us i truly hope you come back to your roots and give us the single player experience we have waited so long for thank you for your time
