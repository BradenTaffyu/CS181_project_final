2020 early access review this is a tentative thumbs down for caves of qud there is a lot to admire about qud from the offbeat sense of humor to the intricate levels and large variety of character options and play approaches i say tentative because i think a large part of the appeal of qud comes from the emergent game play how appealing that is to you may well mean you have a more positive experience with qud than i did there is quite a lot of lore including some fantastically written in universe history books but i never particularly felt engaged by the story the really interesting stuff seemed to be in the past or happening to npcs during the course of the main game most of the quests are little more than fetch lists that only have two options either you accept and continue the quest or decline and that s it the quest just hangs there forever unresolved with no impact on the world yourself or the person offering the quest i have to admit i never actually finished the main story line the rather unbalanced game economy and frustrating combat eventually got to me items quickly become hideously expensive while many goods are extremely heavy so you have to make many many round trips to sources of valuable liquids or gear or just abuse the teleport system and kill the salt beast guarding a desert merchant teleport the beast back to a trading hub and buy out every merchant in the whole city at which point you might as well just use console commands to spawn in the stuff you want the outcome is the same the 2nd path is just a lot less tedious the combat is where i ultimately lost interest caves of qud is very much a dungeon crawler even when it s above ground you will fight hundreds upon thousands of monsters in qud the same type of snapjaws dozens of times the same turrets dozens of times run away from the same slumbering hulk dozens of times after a while the loop of combat loot the bodies flog the loot for dosh back in the town return to exploring get two screen closer to the next quest objective return to step one just got in the way of actually finding new places and exploring the fact that even basic enemies can kill you in two or three unlucky turns setting you back anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour or multiple hours if you forgot to save or left permadeath turned on exacerbates how repetitive the fights are on the other hand if you are a fan of classic roguelikes with very steep learning and difficulty curves all of the above may be a positive in which case consider this a thumbs up
