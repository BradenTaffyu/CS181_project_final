2019 early access review this game has been in early access for seven years if that isn t enough to deter you then let me just say this there s a reason its still early access and it isn t because the developers have abandoned it it s because they have come down with a hard case of indecisivitis the game has basically been done and re done and re done again from the ground up 17 times it s nothing like it was when i bought it and for that reason it gets a hard no on my list of games not recommended had they just added content and tweaked and optimised content that already existed then it would have been a great game about 4 years ago but they chose to add a little bit of content that is barely functional and focus on re making core mechanics over and over and over again recommended no
