2020 it s a game with great potential but it falls utterly short in reaching it the idea of creating a rad space empire is great explore the mysteries of the universe meet new and exciting species blow them up or invite them into the captains quarters for a little kirk action too bad it is riddled with flaws that make it both frustrating and unfun to play the ai this is probably the biggest issue in the game the ai is hot garbage if you build the late game galactic wonder that lets you see the entire galaxy you will be treated to sights of ai fleets wandering uselessly between systems seemingly lost and confused as their enemies devour their planets upon taking ai worlds you will be nauseated to find a repulsive mess of buildings that you have to immediately delete lest they tank your entire economy with their idiocy this get s even worse when added to the micro paradox hates people who don t play tall empires this is a pretty common theme between their games but the extent to which they punish players who want to paint the map in this game is absurd not through game mechanics but through having to micro manage every individual planet which late game can be dozens of worlds to juggle resettlement unemployment and construction true you can assign planets to sectors under ai control but only if you like watching your economy get thanos snapped as the ai somehow simultaneously drops every single resource production into the red warfare it can be cinematic but that s about it you want to know the strategy have more ships with bigger guns the end there is no heroically fending off a larger empire outside of cheesing the ai a truly herculean task given it s brilliance if your fleet is smaller you will lose particularly delightful early game when the ai s heavy economic advantages allow them to have twice your fleet size this is about the only point in the game where the ai is consistently aggressive i suppose it s kind of them to kill you off early and save you from the next several hours of tedious boredom in short great concept great potential rancid execution it s a game that gets worse the more you play it and somehow get s more flawed with each expansion and dlc i don t regret all the time i ve spent on this game just most of it
