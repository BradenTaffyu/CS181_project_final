2020 even tho this game is f2p in reality it is not played it before steam release and its nothing new even after a big break you can play main story up to lvl 50 and story is oke for an mmo but thats it after that you will need to pay if you are f2p you are limited in exp bag space money action bars customization no extra content and so on they limit you in every way to force you to buy sub also this is ea so they push adds for cartel coins in game real money tokens as much as they can in your face overall game is not worth to sub my opinion but also for f2p players its to limited and that makes it unplayable
