2018 many of those who would read this review now are probably interested because of the newly introduced semi modern tanks helicopters and boats still in beta tl dr if this has you curious i would suggest you do not waste your time unless you would like to spend upwards of 100 likely more purchasing a pack playing these new vehicles without spending money will likely take you over a year unless you have 30 hours a week to spend on this game to give you an idea of what these vehicles cost gaijin sells packs of a single tank helicopter combo on their market for 100 dollars this includes a single tank of which the game has 460 including premium and event vehicles and a single helicopter it also includes about 20 of premium and ge that means those vehicles cost roughly 30 each it is also important to note that repairing these vehicles at this high of a tier is very expensive and before long you would not be able to repair them as it is very hard to make a profit in high tiers there was a time where i looked at warthunder as the gold standard for f2p games however that time was more than two years ago over the course of the last few years gaijin has become excessively greedy in their business practices lootboxes have been introduced greater need to purchase premium their own internal marketing system paywalled beta testing and over the top vehicle prices have made gaijin one of the greediest gaming companies that i have ever seen youre probably thinking well dashreker it is a free to play game cant i just not pay while you are certainly correct you are going to find quickly that playing your favorite historical vehicles is going to be a lot harder and likely further away than you think like many have mentioned before this game is a second job and gaijin keeps it that way research points and silver lions are limited by caps each game for both premium and non premium players this means that someone who gets 7 tank kills and 1 death will receive nearly the exact same amount as someone in the same game with 4 kills and 2 deaths this is especially important for higher tiers which require increasing amount of points to not only unlock but to play as well many top tier vehicles are very difficult to play without spending money in order to unlock critical vehicle features that require significant amounts of research points to unlock the higher the tier additionally silver lions are required to repair these tanks after a defeat in fact these high tiers are very difficult to succeed in as the repair cost for one of them is equal to or more than your average winnings at non premium levels this necessitates the use of premium accounts otherwise you have to grind to play vehicles you have already unlocked if you are exceptionally patient with considerable time on your hands it can take up to a year or more to unlock these high tier vehicles unless of course you spend money on a premium account premium vehicles many of which are superior to their unlockable counterparts and vehicle upgrades such as talismans in addition event vehicles are now often purchasable circumventing the hard work that unlocking them should require if this grind is not an issue for you then there is the games progress itself that is just as concerning over the last few years gaijin has focused solely on vehicle creation and their new naval combat which means that both the tank and aircraft game modes have remained stagnant for over 4 years both air and ground game modes are uninventive and are little more that team death matches most ground battles often devolve into a spawn camp the majority of games that will you play will look like 7 8 minutes of combat and 7 8 minutes of camping a spawn for that last survivor air battles are dull and predicable they are neither objective based nor team oriented and are simply deathmatches many of the maps are unbalanced and poorly designed with very little thought introduced low tier vehicles are often times placed into massive maps meaning that by the time you have reached combat the game may already be half over i appologize if this has become a rant however i can not stand by gaijin and their practices if you are looking to enjoy early mid ww2 vehicles in a semi realistic setting then i believe you may enjoy this game if you are not then i simply do not suggest it unless you dont mind dishing out your wallet for vehicles that nearly cost the price of a aaa game
