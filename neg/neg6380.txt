2023 buy premium version of game being 100 get told that it includes all future expansion and such drop a dlc not included in premium version mfw edit i feel like this needs to be explained for all the it s just 5 bucks people idc about spending more money on the game i clearly love the game i bought all expansions dlc on fh4 and did the same on fh5 or so i thought just don t lie to me about it or make the premium version more expensive a lot of ways to be candid honest and fair about it just not the way it was done
