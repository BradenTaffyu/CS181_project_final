2023 first off i put about 500 hrs into the game on epic summary arena is pretty trash and has been for a very long time tbh but it s still magic it s adictiveness gives crack a run for it s money the good ui is fine there are ppl playing it drafting is funthe sorta bad the cost for packs is alright i guess well not entirely lemme explain don t get me wrong it s not cheap by any means but a lot cheaper than paper magic for sure i understand peoples complaints about mtga feeling predatory tho cause you don t actually own anything in the game if we are talking purely digital value then it s monetized like a shady mobile game that s true for sure the downright ugly bored out of my mind to see the same handful of decks no matter what mode there is very little deviation from meta decks even in quick games meaning you will get smashed with most experimental builds and build meta decks yourself in the long run quick games are basically just there to cheese dailies ppl go afk when searching for matches let timers expire constantly when losing and quit more often than playing more than 5 turns it s just frustrating and it has been for a long time locking daily progression behind winning games is honestly a very dumb move by wizards and causes aformentioned playstyles if you re behind turn 3 just leave the game yay plain dumbfounded by this game design summary game is pretty trash in it s state tbh but it s adictiveness gives crack a run for it s money
