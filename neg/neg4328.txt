2016 as someone who has been a hopeless addict since the days of civilization ii and who was still playing civ v up until this release i was very anxious to finally get my hands on civ vi i watched some of the pre release gameplay on the interwebs so i was prepared for the most obvious changes i really really really wanted to love this game and there are parts that i do love the new way that cities are managed where each tile can contain a valuable resource or an even more valuable district is sublime having to pick and choose which cities will focus on what vs the old method of just building everything everywhere is far more realistic and challenging the new trade system which not only increases your gold income but can also provide boosts in science culture and production while simultaneously and freely building a road network is a huge improvement over past iterations researching cultural advancements as well as technological breakthroughs provides a whole new level of development earning and deploying envoys to gradually boost your influence and rewards from city states is a fresh new take on that mechanic frequently earning boosts to your technological or cultural advancement simply by doing normal activities which you d have done anyway is great the amount of thought going into this game and the obvious efforts to deploy a truly new civilization rather than a re skin of past versions is quite welcome but for every one of the goods there is a bad with so many potential paths toward development and city building the game itself can be overwhelming at times the new hyper aggressive barbarians can require far too much effort to contain during the crucial early game diplomacy with the ai is just as baffling as ever if not more so you ll frequently get cryptic messages from ai leaders which hint to something you re doing well or not without explaining what it is you ll still have ai empires pledging eternal friendship and adoration in one turn and then declaring war on you the next you ll frequently be offered one sided trades which hurt your diplomacy rating if refused and once the ais have declared war on you and fought just as ineffectually as ever you ll be offered a king s ransom to return to peace the map itself can be difficult to decipher as some resources look very similar and rain forest tiles have the tendency to obscure goody huts or barbarian camps located within them ship building and intercontinental exploration seems to come a little too soon on the timeline leading to even more inane and unskippable diplomacy screens once religions come into play the missionary spam is unbelievable and largely unstoppable the sleep and skip turn buttons are easily confused with builders and settlers making for the possibility of forgetting a unit for centuries garrisoned units and city walls do not automatically activate when a hostile unit is within range but units set to fortify until healed do re activate every time they are attacked all of this leads to a great deal of unnecessary button mashing map scrolling and waiting for the dang ai to shut up so you can just get on with the next turn it s that last bit which is perhaps most disappointing in this game i no longer feel that one more turn urge which i have in every previous edition of the franchise i ve started numerous games using different leaders and map settings and the lack of map options is another downgrade but i ve yet to actually finish a single game each attempt starts the same found my capital expand bump into ai civs attempt to build up good relations with them and then end up fighting wars which they cannot possibly win but insist on starting meanwhile i m trying to remember which city just finished which district deciding whether to produce even more districts or building within them or wonders or military units or builders settlers to further expand or traders for money or spies for diplomacy or architects for ruins but do i have enough buildings to put them in it really is a case of too many options spoiling the whole thing oh and when you tack on keeping track of which cities need more housing or amenities or food to expand it becomes more of a chore than a form of entertainment long time civ fans will have already bought this game so there s no point in making a recommendation to them those new to the franchise have probably been actively avoiding it up until now so there s no point there either but on the off chance that you re someone familiar with civilization who has not yet purchased this version wait with some patches and refinements this may well become a very good game but in its current form it might be worth the money but it isn t worth the time required to play it
