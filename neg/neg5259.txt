2017 i will make this as brief as possible the combat engine hasn t been improved since empire total war and this tradition ofrelying on a completely unrealistic and cinematic engine is continued in tw warhammer melee units still form giant blobs of doom with rear ranks either standing around being happy to just exist instead of moving to the sides to surround enemies or they push into the front ranks which are currently busy clipping into the enemy formation additionally the tracers to identify arrows and gun fire are now ridiculously large i have no clue why ca didn t just use the same tracers they used in shogun ii or heck even those from empire napoleon atleast they looked like projectiles instead of some kind of wind magic infused bullet one thing ca did right perhaps the only positive change in regards to the combat mechanics is that they removed the tedious micromanagement no longer does one have to click an extra abiltiy on the ui to make your cavalry charge with full power instead we re back to the same system that has been used since the first shogun and rome i e a cavalry unit will automatically charge if it had enough space to gain speed however due to the nature of the crappy combat engine it also has a habit of going haywire every now and then resulting in cavalrymen stopping mid charge as in full stop only to then jump to warp ix and bash into the enemy formation moving on to siege weaponry it s just as useless as it was in rome ii i just witnessed a battering ram not doing anything to an iron gate and thus i removed mypikemen from it leaving it in front of the gate i then ordered the pikemen to attack the iron gate and what do you know they poked it to death my gigantic mortar also used up all it s ammunition only bringing the gate to around 70 damage atleast i didn t pay money for the mortar and it did take out a few of the archers on top of the gate house so i guess it s all good in the end as for empire management it s rome ii i e completely cluttered nonsensical and boring the province army management agent and building systems in place are still as bad as they were in the first place how ca decided to go from a dumbed down but still alright system in shogun ii to this and just decided to stay with it throughout 3 games is a completely unsolvable riddle to me the sad part is that there s interesting ideas behind all of it but nothing is fully realised or if realised works against the franchise s goals the province system is a one to one copy from rome ii without any changes construct buildings gain synergy recruit badass badasses and win the army management system looks like something i d assume to find in one of those early 2000s rts games that tries to innovate no matter what without actually innovating point in case age of mythology which added a lot of cool stuff to the age of empires style of rts but forgot to innovate the franchise for real and instead opted to just add some extras why after rome ii and attila made this mistake am i still being forced to recruit generals to move units around why can i build a stable at city a and recruit cavalry all the way on the other side of the province at the border of city c why why why does the entire army management feel like it s from a badly designed indie game rather than a reknown strategy dev does that mean that everything is bad no there actually are some good parts i do like the random events which i hope are randomised and won t be the same for every playthrough except for certain key things the general hero management is cool i like how embedded agents actually fight on the battlefield as a seperate unit additionally the skill trees for these characters have a very nicely done rpg theme to them every now and then you get some loot equip it and enjoy the benefits some smaller some larger however that little bit of good improvements doesn t break free from the major issues that have been plaguing this franchise since empire and that was about 8 years ago now that i think about it empire 2009napoleon 2010shogun ii 2011fall of samurai 2012rome ii 2013attila 2015warhammer 2016is anyone even surprised that these guys can t even fix an engine that hasn t worked properly since 2009 every game they promise improvements but in the end nothing comes out of it instead they keep pumping out new games with the same engine and minor changes here and there now for my recommendation get this game when it s on a super low sale price i got it for 10 36 from the humble monthly and i d say that s about the highest i would go for the base game perhaps 19 99 with all dlc but frankly spoken the few extra races don t change much in my opinion sure cool new and different units with new approaches and abilities but in the end the base game remains the same with the same issues and on that note this is a game that when you start it and enter the main menu immediately opens the dlc tab of the menu this is a game that when you click on the options menu and change something then leave the menu again once again opens the dlc tab this is a game that wants you to buy more stuff because more is better it doesn t matter that it s more of the same old broken and uncared for stuff it just wants to sell it to you edit since steam doesn t allow for comments with more than 1000 characters themilk dominic as mentioned in the review it s worth the 10 36 it cost me on the humble monthly depending on your regional equivalent i d say that statement remains the same considering the additional issues i ve encountered since i ve written this review i wrote it at about 6 hours played and now i m above 40 hours i d once again substantiate this point the dlc is highly overpriced and adds things that are quite balance breaking in comparisson to non dlc owners just one example a friend of mine bought the the king and warlord dlc so that we could stomp ais as a double dwarf alliance he immediately had access to upgraded versions of the core tech tree units while i had to rely on the vanilla game s unit roster in addition to being upgraded versions they also consist of units otherwise unavailable during the early campaign due to requiring upgraded buildings i d highly recommend either of these business decisions 1 buy it on humble monthly enjoy what the basic game has to offer despite the massive flaws and buy the dlc once it s cheaper on sale 2 wait for a complete edition which i think is planned for later this year however if it costs more than 29 99 or your regional equivalent i d still hold off from it 3 don t bother at all there s plenty of good total war games out there if you aren t bothered by older graphics then i recommend either rome i or medieval i medieval ii is fine too otherwise i can recommend shogun 2 if graphics are important to you or if you re looking for a coop game however the combat system ai and overall empire management in shogun 2 is already fairly weak in comparisson to older titles
