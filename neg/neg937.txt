2023 it is to fallout new vegas what skyrim is to morrowindthat is to say a shallow experience that ll lull you into a dull state your eyes will skim over simplistic dialogue and you ll thoughtlessly follow quest markers left clicking on anyone with a red name and then looting their corpses for whatever randomly generated goodies spawn on their bodies eventually you ll get a good item or level up and you ll feel a small bump of dopamine that quickly dissipates as the gameplay loop continues to spin there is no mechanical challenge not a single encounter in this game is difficult you won t need to take cover and you hardly need to aimthere is no ethical challenge the factions and people in this game are so comically underwritten that you ll struggle to care about anyone or anythingthere is no strategic challenge ammo guns and resources are aplenty and your special allocation and perks hardly matter even if you refused to level wore no armor and didn t loot any resources you ll be able to tediously but still easily beat the game with your bare knucklesthere is no intellectual challenge npcs can always be taken a face value nobody attempts to trick you there are no puzzles which are hard to solve and despite the game s central plot being inspired by blade runner it s attempts to imitate the film s philosophical dilemmas are both surface level and poorly executed believe me when i say this fallout 4 is as mentally engaging as watching tv commercials the only respite from this dreary game is the far harbor expansion pack still comically easy but at least somewhat interesting
