2016 at the time i m writing this review i have about 302 hours into the game i mained the german nation going on tier 5 planes going on tier 3 4 ground as everyone has mentioned a russian bias in one form or another it is real i know 302 hours isn t much compared to other plays but i think its a valid amount to make a comment with russian bias in application air all russian aircraft are almost impossible to shoot down even with direct hits from cannons e x i was once flying my tier 4 me410 u1 a4 and i hit a tier 2 yak with a 50mm air target round the yak survived this has happened more than once and for scale a 50mm air target round can one shot a heavy american bomber russian aircraft notably the yak line have exaggerated climb rates that arent shown on stat profiles but are very clear in game russian aircraft maintain speed a lot better than others russian bombers have incredible ai gunner accuracy compared to other nations the us has a p 51 mustang which was also given to russia as a premium the exact same plane but with a lower br russian machine guns are op as russian bias in application ground if you fight a russian tank in the same tier as you you might as well ditch your tank theres no point in fighting as you need at least a tier higher tank to destroy a lower tier russian tank unless you get a good shot russians will always pen your armor russians are more likely to set your tank on fire russians deflect shots that shouldn t be possible if you can pen 200 mm of armor why can t you pen russian 80mm effective thickness at 90 degress with a tiger honestly and factually speaking each nation has their own benefits and drawbacks usa very balanced play style just as weak as they are strong germany high speed high climb strong ammo metal armored planes crappy turning brits good turn fighting climbing accurate guns crappy armor japanese amazing turn fighting crappy armor paper armor russia amazing turn fighting amazing climb rate amazing armor accurate guns amazing ammo everything of which is boosted and not historically accurate as oppose to other nations which more or less are every patch in a nutshell if germany gets new plane nerf german air if russa gets new plane nerf german air if any nation gets buffed buff russiai know this review seems very bias against russia but honestly you will notice a bias towards the russian nation if you play this game overall the game is very fun and interesting but its a big big turn off when you get killed by a russian vehicle that was shotting in the opposite direction with a gun that can t pen your armor from any angle or spot
