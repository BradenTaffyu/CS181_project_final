2018 up until relatively recently i d have thoroughly recommended stellaris for me this was a day one purchase that i didn t regret however since the 2 0 update all the warnings that i was given about buying paradox games early i e several years came home to roost the 2 0 change isn t just polish or updated content it completely changes the game asymmetric warfare gone effective war mechanics gone space that felt like space gone multiple ftl methods a core selling point when the game came out gone instead we re forced into playing a less interesting version of every other 4x game coupled with some really weird design decisions part of the appeal of these games part of the appeal of stellaris pre 2 0 is a sense of freedom to build explore conquer as you see fit now the game practically requires you to do things in set orders punishes you for stepping outside the dev specified rails and feels more like a re texture of paradox s other games than the fresh new innovative design they d originally touted there s genuinely less strategy to be found since all your wars all your games feel like they play out the same way that there s often really only one or two viable choices i used to have games where i could make ridiculous gambles and when they paid off have a real sense of achievement now i know such gambles will get nuked by the dev s changes of mechanics and clearly their aims and mine for the game differ add to that the recent dlc pricing difficulties and yes paradox apologised and tried to solve that so kudos to them for that but it still calls into question their decision making the dlcs that make your game appear aesthetically strange because the graphical changes ship designs etc aren t in line with the rest of the game and i get a growing sense that the game is mutating before my very eyes into something i probably wouldn t have spent money on reading back over dev diaries it s clear paradox received unusual levels of negative feedback about these changes but pursued them anyway in the hope of a better game pleasing a specific segment of vocal fans on their forums i m disappointed to say that for me a day one risker they ve failed i doubt i ll be taking such risks again on the plus side i may one day reinstall the old 1 9 1 beta build have a blast or two but even the mods are hard to come by now since most have updated for later builds and bugfixes of course will no longer be forthcoming a disappointing result for a once really stellar game
