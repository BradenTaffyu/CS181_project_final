2021 if there was an ehh or mixed review option i d have picked it fallout 4 isn t necessarily bad by any means but neither would i say its particularly any good fallout 4 is really dying for meaningful non main story quest content fo4 has a settlement builder system in which you design a settlement using pre designed bits and pieces to fill usually nameless npc needs and to attract usually nameless npcs the vast majority of the settlement locations you find are usually completely empty and must be built from the ground up if you enjoy that by all means but i personally found the settlement builder to be incredibly clunky if you didn t want to interact with the settlement builder at all beyond the few quest required reasons fallout 4 features around 6 major settlements of which you can potentially destroy i believe 4 of them the vast majority of encounters you ll have in boston are just hostile npcs standing around waiting for you to either take a shot at them or get within range for them to detect you while obviously having some unavoidable combat situations is always a good way to try and discourage min maxed charisma social builds effectively every situation is unavoidable combat and my god you will be doing a lot of shooting if you were going into fo4 just to have a looter shooter experience no harm or shame in that it s an rpg after all however combat is effectively the only solution for the vast majority of problems in the game so you are set however i d like to add combat gets quite stale one thing i ve noticed and after hitting up the wiki and confirmed is that fo4 seriously lacks weapon variety in total not counting unique weapons which fo4 handles poorly or explosives there are roughly 62 weapons in the game not counting creation club as i would never pay 5 for just one extra shotgun of those 62 31 are ranged and 31 are melee now you might think weapon modding allows you to get around that surely a sufficiently modded weapon would feel and look almost completely distinct from its base counterpart right this is mostly untrue for the vast majority of weapons most weapon modifications fall under the incremental stat boost type for many weapons modding follows effectively a straight line as there are either no side grades or the side grades are usually an obviously terrible choice let s take for example the 10mm pistol you can mod upgrade 6 different weapon parts receiver barrel grip magazine sights and muzzle most guns have about the same categories for receivers it is almost aa straight upgrade path with each upgrade increasing firerate and damage the only side grade being if you want the pistol to become automatic in exchange for less damage per shot for the barrel it is a straight upgrade path you make the weapon ever so slightly heavier for some extra accuracy and reduced recoil the weight is so minor it isn t worth considering grips are a straight upgrade path each grip exchanges a tiny amount of weight for less recoil magazines have a side grade in the middle with a choice between either a larger magazine or faster reloading magazine in the end you get both an expanded and faster reloading magazine for sights ignoring glowing iron sights iron sights but green you either have a reflex sight red dot circle sight or a recon scope if you go automatic you take the reflex sight if you go semi automatic either one works muzzle mods might seem like there are some side grade options but in the end you exchange tiny amounts of weight for less recoil and more accuracy the muzzle brake mod description implies that its a side grade to the suppressor mod but after doing some digging the suppressor is a straight upgrade and you also get mild stealth capabilities let s get into story the start my god is the start terrible you spend a good amount of time slowly walking inside a house pre war just interacting with then you run to a vault watch the bombs drop then you go into a vault and sit into a cryochamber get frozen get unfrozen wake up watch your spouse get shot and your son kidnapped re frozen and then you escape the vault and then finally you re let out to the world at large this whole process can take a hot minute and it s honestly pointless you backstory of being a survivor from the pre war period that isn t a ghoul is largely irrelevant most npcs either don t take you seriously or they accept it and don t care the whole point of it it seems was to have a player character who can ask seemingly insane questions like why are you selling guns or what is a ghoul even though by that point you ve likely killed more than a hundred ghouls and probably talked to a few of them you being a vault survivor much like in 3 seems entirely irrelevant to the plot at large while the plot with your son could maybe be argued as needing you to be from a vault it s such a terribly designed main plot that it honestly just doesn t matter among other things the map itself feels incredibly small crammed while many complained about new vegas being a big desert it helped establish a wasteland ish ness and it let you always see the big cool stuff in the distance fallout 4 has trees everywhere tiny little ruined houses in the middle of nowhere city streets lined with weirdly intact buildings seriously a nuke landed like a 15 minute jog away and boston looks like detroit does today that block you from actually seeing anything until you get close enough to stumble into it another thing of note enemies are leveled strangely at a point you ll fight super mutants you can one shot with whatever gun you have one minute but then three minutes later you ll encounter a child of the atom who wearing nothing but rags can tank multiple headshots from high damage rifles this goes for a lot of npcs speaking of bizzare gameplay balance legendary enemies they are a terrible addition effectively they have a glow on their bodies and have extra regenerating health that is all they are bulletsponges when you kill them they drop a legendary weapon or armor these legendary items take a base item from the game maybe give it a few weapon mods and then give it a legendary effect for armor it might be 1 str and 1 end for weapons it might be set enemies on fire this is also how fallout 4 makes its unique weapons and armor the vast majority of unique items are simply fixed legendary versions for example the le fusils terribles is functionally identical to the combat shotgun it is based off but it has a legendary effect that makes it deal 25 extra damage in exchange for more recoil the weapon has no visual differences and will always have that effect every single playthrough coincidentally there is a slight chance that a legendary enemy will drop a combat shotgun with that exact legendary effectwhat does fo4 get right it looks nice i ll give it that the visuals have held up pretty well over the years and without any visual modding it still looks decent but living npcs have this weird glow around them that makes them stand out especially in the dark the gunplay is better than new vegas or 3 but like i said suffers from staleness and lack of weapon variety there are much better cooler scripted events the vertibird ride is always cool power armor is great really makes you feel like a walking tank my only complaint is that its everywhere even raiders regularly have power armor now and like every 10th location has a suit of power armor hidden somewhere in or nearby it it becomes significantly less cool when you stumble upon your seventh power armor suit just on some random boat on the pier power armor is moddable but like weapons and armor it suffers from the same issues though to a lesser degree
