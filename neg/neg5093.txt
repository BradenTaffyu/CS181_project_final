2017 bought the game and was happy with it realized after a while that i was essentially only buying half a game so many simple things added in that should have been part of the initial game i am usually very understanding of dlc but it got ridiculous very quickly and the prices on most of the dlc are not reasonable at all for the content you get with it it is hard to recommend this game unless you are willing to pay 60 dollars still for a game that will have more content you likely will never be willing to buy but will really wish you had nothing is as sigh worthy as loading up a new campaign and seeing just how many of the leaders or races you won t have access to and is very in your face about it only game on my steam list that i have played this much but really wish i had my money back on about 40 hours ago
