2023 konami has actually ruined master duel by allowing tearlaments to come to the game without any sort of proper balancing i have never had a more miserable ranked experience with this game i m running into it every other match at all ranks and it is beyond broken no meta deck i ve encountered before has been this dominating in every way i do not care if there are ultra specific decks that run counter to it having to build an entire deck just to counter 1 specific meta deck is a waste of gems and if i might put my tin foil hat on for one moment probably by design you have a good game on your hands here for once konami the banlists have been pretty good up until now please listen to the playerbase nerf tearlaments and don t allow another archetype to come to master duel again without any sort of balance
