2023 it s a skinner box with cars the primary path of progression is a slot machine there are loads of cars but if what you want to drive isn t a modern supercar there s a 50 50 chance it s not in the game it s a shallow shell of a video game with nothing to do besides make number go up whether that s the meaningless number by your name or the massive number of cars you re never going to drive the only thing that keeps this game from being exemplary of everything that s wrong with the modern aaa games industry is the relative lack of microtransactions but that s only because they don t have anything to sell you
