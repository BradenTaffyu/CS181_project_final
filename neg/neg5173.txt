2016 an amazing warhammer game completly so an amazing total war game no while i think that it is one of total war s better games they screwed up some things royally in this game seiges now being the worst since ever the real problem for me is the dlc storm i remember when you bought a game for 60 you got a full completed game now you get a game that maybe has half the full content planned for it at the same price my hope is that either all future planned faction dlc s are either 5 at most or just plain free p s for all those people saying well in tabletop we have to pay 500 often you can t compare these two its like trying to compare apples to oranges this is a video game not a tabletop game
