2023 great game but the devs care more about quick cash over long lasting players based on a post that was made by them recently of the time 5 21 2023 they also pretty much admitted to it and mentioned things that were so detached it was offensive to read stuff like saying how it should take a reasonable but not too long amount of time to get to high level vehicles when it takes a dedicated player nearly hundreds upon hundreds of hours to get to high tier of a single tech tree edit 12 14 2023the game a a bit more friendly to newer players and friends i had that quit the game due to the grind have started getting back into the game and giving it another shot the xp gain system still sucks rather bad at higher tiers which sucks for if you want to get right into modern jets in a game that does very well at modelling them both look and feel wise sadly that means i still dont really agree with suggesting this game to people at least if they plan on playing it for cold war jets or higher you wont get it anytime soon and even with premium it takes an annoying amount of time to get the more modern jets that i lose interest for days at a time and sometimes weeks earning vehicles needs to change there is no reason to have repair cost and we need to not feel punished for playing to have fun if you re looking to play this game for any form of cold war vehicle or up be ready to either sit through unneeded pain for probably a year of your time or spend more money then you could earn in a single pay cheque they only care about cash whales you as a normal player mean nothing to them
