2017 there is a horrible gamebreaking bug that totally ruined one of my playthroughs mid game i suddenly lost all of my national treasury in one turn even though i had positive gold per turn and lots of gold in reserves i continued for several turns to see if earned any gold since i was at 0 gold but still had positive gold flow to my surprise i still had not earned any more gold even though i had positive gold per turn my game got destroyed by this bug since my units got disbanded one by one each turn and my civilization crumbled together would recommend waiting until the devs have fixed most of this game s bugs including this one
