2023 early access review this should have been a free upgrade to all past ark se owners they never fixed the original game never delivered on tons of features that were promised now they re not only trying to double dip this crap but they re going to call this early access again drip feeding maps for the next year or longer so i guess ark 2 is a long way out and in need of money huh wildcard visually the game looks beautiful in the new engine but it s literally just ark se with a facelift this should have been free and wildcard snailgames are just greedy tencent money w soh and the decision to force people using 3rd party server providers to only be able to use nitrado was suuuuuuuuuuper shady i m sure you got a nice kickback for that but nitrado is dog and their interface was literally the worst one out there well done
