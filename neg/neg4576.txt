2018 look i kinda liked the game is not civ v much less civ iv but you could play it allright the big problem is this of installing spyware that runs wherever you play or not the game if i had pirated the game i wouldnt have the spyware installed so my suggestion is if you want to play it pirate it you wont get in the ass for doing so if you bought it like me there is no easy way to uninstall red shell block these ports and be aware that eventually they will put more servers so you will have to be on the lookout untill you uninstall this game and similars redshell block0 0 0 0 redshell io0 0 0 0 api redshell io0 0 0 0 treasuredata com0 0 0 0 in treasuredata com 1 redshell io 1 api redshell io 1 treasuredata com 1 in treasuredata comsteam is not doing anything about this either
