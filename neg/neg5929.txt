2022 btd 6 was about to add ads to the game being pay to play as is glad they stopped when they could still even with all the gameplay and strategy this game has i simply cannot recommend it due to the unavailability of the game while you re offline now this would have made sense if the game was strictly multiplayer but with so many stages and gamemodes online connection is just a way to access to miscellaneous gamemodes and limited time offers all that really doesn t touch how the game is more than playable without connection to the net yet this game restricts you what s your problem additionally the fanbase of all of bloons tower defense is kids highly toxic immature as kids are it s not the devs fault per say i m not even sure what could be causing toxicity in a cartoony pve game some towers are straight up just better than others no matter how many balance changes they put out surely there are many situational ones but the point still stands cost or power there is always some outstanding difference tower upgrades have very bad descriptions it forces you to go to the wiki in order to know what you re getting for example the bloons will wish they were never inflated doesn t at all give me an idea of what exactly the upgrade does other than make the tower stronger co op mode outputs extremely little monkey money making you feel obligated to play solo until you have all that you wanted heroes are voiced with annoyingly too much vigor yes there is a special slider for its volume yes it was added because of that the game s built in speed up button is with all due respect trash if you want to try a certain strategy in a hard gamemode there are many many early rounds you will have to go through i ve made myself many cups of tea waiting for them to pass it s all the little things that conglomerate into one thick pile of nuisance that would tick me off
