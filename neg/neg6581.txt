2016 at the time of posting this the cheating that s going on it this game is still an issue both valve i understand they don t have to and fromsoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this i basically got a whole lot of f uck you in response cheats since last i played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed well over a month ago at this point fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges the usual infinite health stamina and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromsoft these are still a thing what makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out the rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls as for the actual gameplay my major complaint besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with is how bad sorcery has it this time around no one was asking for from to make the game easy for us don t understand how it ever was dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp however with 90 of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair playing as melee spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent starting at 60 int is where you ll start to see the damage accel at keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you re still dangerous remember how soul spear and the crystal spells bar homing crystal in dks1 were good yeah not so much in this game incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells i started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit i was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was to start my dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best i don t remember these results in the first 2 games in dk1 with mild point allocation i remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon in this game i deal with one swing 200 210 per swing on a normal enemy with a 3 uchi respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon this was done as apparently you don t see minor returns on int until at least 20 so that s my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov i wanted to love this game really i did but i have completely lost faith in from s ability to make an anti cheat system that s worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play
