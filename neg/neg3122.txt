2022 this game has at times been the most fun i have ever had playing pc in my entire life that s not an exaggeration i love history and the ships maps details like the ocean waves and spray are gorgeous has definitely been driving me to research the history of many of these ships the battles can be intense and hyper strategic researching how to play each ship class and learning the mechanics are critical towards having success and when it pays off there s no other game like it the potential of this game is off the charts but here s some downsides the balance of the ship classes leave so much to be desired aircraft carriers that have far too many buffs harass you constantly with virtually no way to defend yourself at this point you can t even shoot them down once they start their attack run which is the most vulnerable moment for planes this forces players to play soft and clump up making for boring sniper matches subs are back and have homing torpedoes which is fun for sub captains sure but again there is virtually no way to defend yourself other than to use a damage control ability to wipe a sonar ping but you need those for all the he farmers that light your ship on fire every 30 seconds this adds more reason to be timid and hang back i could go on for example a single premium ship costing as much as your typical aaa title while some list for 100 or the incredible amount of time it takes to grind ship tech trees only encouraging you more to purchase their overpriced premium ships don t spend the money enjoy the free tiers to conclude lately i find myself ending a session of wow s with a frustrated feeling of helplessness you play the objective work hard for your team angle change course dodge dodge dodge only to rack up minimal damage and burn flood to death from overpowered carriers or buffed submarines while the brawls and exciting exchanges are fewer and farther between matches this game is the definition of love hate so with that said i can t fully recommend it maybe try it but be wary about sinking any money into it update after 10 mores hours of play since writing the review i am done just uninstalled i spent the last hour being constantly tormented match after match by carrier cv players who i am sure are having just a great time there is no defense against these ship classes especially when they are a decent captain it breaks the game the last straw was starting a tier 8 match and watching the enemy cv take half my health in two passes with the same squadron that s absolutely ridiculous i do think cv s have a role in this game i don t think they should be removed but this is what ruins the play for anyone that loves captaining a classic bb from ww1 or ww2 i would literally have to abandon an entire class of ships to even remotely enjoy this any longer and that s horrendous game design they just want your money and will employ any gimmick to get it
