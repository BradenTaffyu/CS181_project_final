2017 time to post my review i guess i used to play wt non stop i loved it but something happened in 2016 it just became unplayable for me i was up tiered constantly fighting tanks and planes i had no hope of dealing with the grind became so bad i just gave up on tier 4 and the russian bias was so apparent it was almost funny wt is nothing short of the prime example of a love hate relationship i love the gameplay and what is strived to be but all its underlying issues and gaijin not giving a damn to fix them makes me hate it the community is the worst i have seen balance doesnt exist grind is unbearable and dont get me started on gaijin net in its current state i give it a 3 10 it used to be a 5 but then malware happened and that wt isnt off steam for gaijin net is incredible do not get wt its not worth your time in its current state and probably will never be worth your time ever again
