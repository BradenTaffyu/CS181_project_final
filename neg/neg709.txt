2018 i find it highly disturbing that bethesda has gone down a similar anti consumer road to the likes of ea with these monthly content patches that serve no real purpose other than to break free mods in a misguided attempt to push people toward the creation club the creation club is a terrible service which provides very few mods that are anything more than shovelware most are utterly half baked mods that are vastly inferior when compared to similar free mods the best mods on creation club are mostly cookie cutter copies of already existing free mods the hellfire armor for example this fact highlights another severe issue bethesda broke their own word from when they initially announced the creation club they stated that all mods on creation club would have to be new content that they wouldn t just take free mods and make them paid mods through creation club the hellfire armor among many other examples puts the lie to this statement these practices should not be rewarded no matter the fact that this game was in many ways an improvement over fallout 3 new vegas unless bethesda changes these practices this is the last game of theirs that i will be purchasing
