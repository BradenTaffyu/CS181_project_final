2023 early access review honestly when asa was announced and it was decided to sell it again for full price i was under the assumption that the entire game was going to be overhauled graphically dinos creatures included we know wc has new better creature models thanks to previews from ark 2 so why does asa just use the exact same models as ase there are a ton of old dino models that could have used a major upgrade even by ase s standards so i would have thought wildcard would use the opportunity of a full game remaster to upgrade the dino visuals too but now the only real difference is for some not all dinos a few small texture tweaks and lighting that s it now compared to the hyperrealistic environment of asa the dinos and the mammals too honestly look extremely out of place they look more like cartoony painted plastic toys than real living creatures and it s extremely disappointing for a game that touted on about how awesome graphically and next gen it is there are games still running on ue4 that have far better dino models textures everything take the isle for example if you were to compare the isle s rex to ark s ark s rex looks downright goofy in comparison same with the carno pachy parasaur troodon basically every dino just looks cartoony and plastic they don t look authentic and they don t look like they even belong in their environment for comparison s sake here s ti s rex vs ark s the isle ark and the carno the isle ark the isle s models are far more natural looking and look like they could be realistic living creatures that would belong in a hyperrealistic environment really disappointed we did not get any real improvements in dino visuals from asa hopefully it will come in an update at some point especially for something being resold at full price when its entire premise is this old game but it looks better now ase s dino models worked for ase bc the entire environment kind of matched in art style it was stylized enough that the dino models blended well enough but for asa the creatures don t match at all i can t really recommend this game so far when its number one selling point isn t even complete creature visuals are untouched and without that it s literally just the same game as ase with less content and less mods available if you ve already bought and paid for ase as it stands it doesn t really feel entirely worth it to buy this game as well for full price
