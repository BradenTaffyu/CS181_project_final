i ve played this game since it first released in early access in 2020 its release build is just as shallow as it was in 2020 and its current build is still just as shallow no kingdom or culture actually feels different from the others beyond color schemes once you reach a certain point in the mid game all you will do is fight there is no diplomacy the rogue skill tree is completely pointless nobles have zero character there are zero world wide events no storms no bountiful harvests no horde of united bandits no feasts the game has received no major updates since release the game has not received any new systems since early accesswide as an ocean shallow as a pond
