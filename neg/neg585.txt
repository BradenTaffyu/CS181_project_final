2023 i am in minority here and i know it i m a huge crpg fan and this is pretty much only crpg that i did not like at all the armor and magic armor system is so bad imo there are barely any rpg options when it comes to building characters and the story seemed flat to me maybe if you play premade characters the story is somehow better but why play rpg and not make your own character
