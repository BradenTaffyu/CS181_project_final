2021 i m taking the part in a well deserved review bombing square enix never really cared japanese business plans tend to be the least consumer friendly overall btw but now when we know they actually did some effort fixed the pc version of the game and never patched it here on steam it s just spitting us in the face and it s like using way too fancy words here cuz it s way worse fix it and treat the players that bought automata before the goty edition with proper respect they gave you their money ffs
