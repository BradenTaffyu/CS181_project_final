2021 edit as of 28 05 2021 hackers are running rampant in this game playing with a friend and he got put into ng then after 30 min he got put into ng 4 just playing co op no invasion or anything just a connection error and back to the start of the game it is lost all progression multiple times and got put into a more difficult game a fix is a mod not something official by the developer i would not recommend getting this game until this is fixed if you already own it i would strongly recommend you to use the blue sentinel mod spend more than 100 hours getting gud only to be one shot by a naked dude with a massive weapon hidden in his prison pocket 10 10 would recommend on a more serious note beautiful scenery with a bittersweet story rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights this game keeps dragging me back in play through after play through there is enough content to enjoy yourself and the dlc s are the cherry on top if you like to challenge yourself and have the temper to not destroy your controller you should definitely try it out stay safe skeleton
