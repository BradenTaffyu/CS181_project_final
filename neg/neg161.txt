2022 early access review fundamentally this is a great game the devs were always shooting for a realistic simulation and constantly delivering it however i think this cuts both ways as the clumsy combat and inventory systems turn skill into luck i can t be sure which way a zombie is going to get up off the ground teleport behind me relative to my orientation the way the character snaps to different angles while preparing for a melee hit versus the free control zombies have to approach the character makes hitting the zombie a game of luck or limited choice the inventory windows take up too much screen and it takes too many clicks to fully loot a room i should be able to run by a corpse and quickly skim the gun off of it and i should be able to see everything lootable in one tab i think melee weapons do too little damage i should be able to cave in near all zombie heads with a baseball bat from the standing and ready position especially a wooden bat a professional baseball player can exert 30k newtons of force on a baseball it takes 5k newtons of force to cave in the human skull a human head would have a longer contact with the bat that would result in more energy transferred over a ball and i m not sure if this calculation is truly linear but i would imagine that it would be pretty easy to swing a bat and exert at least half the force of a professional player on a human head just saying axes should be unstoppable and have insane durability a proficient lumberjack can chop down 70 trees a day with one axe forever so long as they can sharpen the blade are you telling me zombie bodies are harder than tree trunks guns are weird simply because knives and other sharp objects are weird if stabbing slicing puncturing doesn t do a lot of damage killing i m not sure why a bullet would somehow do more especially from guns shooting higher speed rounds likely to fully and quickly penetrate the target doing minimal tissue damage the push stomp combo is op especially since head stomps are the target and the teeth are in the head you re telling me stomps are 100 accurate and there aren t any stomping mistakes that result in an ankle bite car home alarms should attract zombies but the zombies shouldn t then peel away towards the character the character is one quiet person running away from the loud alarm while hundreds of bodies are swarming towards the alarm making even more noise and motion clothing should be far more protective than it is no one is biting through a leather jacket google it overall these issues wouldn t be such a big deal because i could just get good at the game or create a custom sandbox but the solo grind experience is too grueling and pointless just to be ruined by random bite events caused by stupid zombie standing teleportation mechanics and unavoidable melee push whiffs i might as well be playing a dice based board game a lot of my problems can be adjusted through custom sandbox parameters though i thought the point of a 10 year development cycle was to slowly balance the game over time to achieve a realistic simulation the game can still be difficult while providing realistic benefits to the player instead of the current sadistic un rewarding experience the game provides base building is ok with friends though the underwhelming crafting system has me questioning if it s ever worth it the only time dependent craftable items are crops so as a solo player i would only be base building to harvest crops it s only useful necessary when playing with others adding additional time dependent features would embolden the idea of fortifying a living space and being able to craft better more powerful weapons and tools from large amounts of resources would also increase dependence on a centralized storage area example adding smelting that requires fuel metal scraps and time to smelt would require that i build and protect a smelter example adding some sort of progressive research system towards an end goal like a cure or escape would also add purpose to the game something that currently exists solely as role play example adding the ability to craft higher quality furniture and utilities that buff the player or provide resting entertainment food bonuses would inspire a desire to protect said resources and return to a base it s fun to pretend but it can also become boring and feel purposeless after so many deaths why am i here of course mods add all of these things but mod creators are generally not under payed for their work when the developers of this almost decade old game are still collecting some amount of money we shouldn t have to rely on the unpaid community to produce content for a 20 game again this game can be fun with friends and mods but the vanilla solo experience is immediately boring after the 10th death
