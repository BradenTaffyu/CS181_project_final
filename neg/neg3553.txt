early access review while the game itself is fantastic and highly enjoyable my poor rating stems from the team and developers behavior they exhibit extreme unprofessionalism and treat individuals who contribute new content to the game like trash i took the initiative to develop a dedicated website offering useful information and tools for fellow players which was well received however despite reaching an agreement with two moderators on the official discord server allowing me to mention my page once a day without posting a link i was unjustly banned by the developer from the server citing excessive self promotion as the reason it s important to note that my website solely focused on game related content serving as a promotional tool for the game itself with no personal gain involved i created this site out of genuine passion and interest in the game only to be met with a ban moreover the developers strict censorship extends to discussions about fan made modifications and expansions which are integral to many games users are cautioned against discussing modifications despite their significant contribution to the gaming community this unprofessional behavior from the developers threatens to alienate the community and ultimately undermine the game itself in conclusion while the game offers an exceptional experience the developer s handling of community interaction and content creation is deeply disappointing and may ultimately harm the game s longevity and appeal for this reason i will no longer support or engage with the game it s alarming to witness how people who genuinely enjoy the game and seek to contribute content are treated here i have never encountered such treatment in any other game
