2019 as of right now it doesn t have much content but it has potential especially since the dev zooi is listening the community if you want a torture simulator and can afford to spend ten bucks grab it now edit 2020 the game is still very unoptimized content updates i havent found to be very impressive i honestly just wish the dev would expanded on their animations he updated them and literally remade the ragdoll once and barely touched those ever again there should be more variations for each possible animation more new animations in general i understand that animations are difficult in a physics game but simply tweaking the current ones enough to make them reasonably different and adding them as new one would be great edit 2021 i admit my pc from when i wrote this review was but even with a better pc it can run other significantly better looking games on max settings with a similar amount of physics objects and particle effects flying around and while ppg runs better now on it too it still has disproportionately worse frame rates and things that id be able to do in gmod on max settings with graphical mods on top i cant in ppg on low settings because the game will freeze or have unbearably low fps
