2016 feels like the base of a great game is there but overall it has the strategic depth of a puddle if you enjoy deep strategy games this is not for you i do admit they got the warhammer lore down perfectly in my opinion but sadly that does not make the game good units no longer have stances or various abilities you would expect them to cavalry don t have formations units with shields cannot go into a shiedwall formation etc your armies basically mob each other in combat 2 masses pushing against each other i noticed alot tend to end up not fighting at all just stuck at the back their turn to fight when those in fromt of them die think ac enemies waiting their turn to fight 1 vs 1to sum it up this game has been overly simplified to the point i did not find it fun and wish i had bought doom instead i expected that to be mindless fun not a good strategy game with depthedit for october 14th my game updated today and now it is unplayable everytime i fight a battle the game crashes at the battles end i have gone through roughly 20 game crashes this way all in the same day since the update i have never had my game crash in the 5 months leading up to this point autoresolving does not make the game crash but what is the point of this game if i cannot fight battles whatever this update did it broke my game from what i have seen on the tech part of the forums i am not the only one
