2020 it s about time i said some things about paradox if i can at least open the eyes of one person that would be enough i m tired of watching great games made by people with talent being ruined by grey suits that never played a game in their life i used to hate ea for just being the scummiest company out there but compared to paradox they are saints paradox is like that friend s girlfriend who cheats on him with everyone but being smart enough about it to never let him know they chop off their games in a thousand pieces and sell 90 of their content as dlc purposefully making games feel incomplete and even removing features from the base game so they can sell even more dlcs and yet you see some players complimenting them for their great work which is specially daunting that s how clueless the average player is about what they do and they know it publishers like paradox are the reason that games as we knew them are now so rare the truth here is that the content you get from any of paradox game s dlcs combined are at least ten times more than you get in the base game just open the page of any of their games and you ll see an endless list of overpriced dlcs those same games even go free to play from time to time or get huge discounts why notice how their dlcs never get the same discounts as the base game because that s how they rob players of a proper game experience you ll always have to pay them 5 6x more to actually experience the game as intended by the talent that made them you got to wonder how many more great games will paradox s leads ruin before people wake up it unfortunately took me 3 games to realize what was happening and what they really do so here i am trying to open some eyes and i wish more people would do the same tldr if you can help it do not support paradox if you really want to play their games just know that what you re buying is an incomplete and intentionally flawed experience and that you ll have to pay a lot more to have the actual game
