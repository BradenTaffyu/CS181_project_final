2015 let me start by saying that i have had fun with this game as you can see by my playtime but that playtime has been plagued by bugs glitches low fps and a constant feeling of why didn t they in the back of my mind i never got into arma 2 because of its fps problems netcode clunky and unintuitive controls and just bad game design arma 3 has fixed none of these problems first off the performance the real virtuality engine is an engine from the 18th century being held together with duct tape and semen server performance still affects client performance this is a joke if the server gets overloaded you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s this is why performance is so inconsistent the player controller is the same one from arma 2 this controller cannot play more than two animations at once on the legs and the torso full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this again this is a joke animations are also very stiff and crappy looking same old bugs and glitches from arma 2 that were never fixed you can lean into walls and see through them much worse if you re using 3rd person grass pops in right in front of your eyes objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you vehicle physics are almost non existent and you will explode from the smallest crash voip is incredibly laggy and sounds like it s coming out of a 90s phone game is supposed to use dx11 when in reality it still uses mostly dx9 one example is shadows arma 3 still uses stencil shadows instead of soft shadows even on max settings aside from that visually the game is nothing special it has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it s quite ugly low res textures are a problem the game is billed as a military sandbox by bohemia and a military simulation by pc gamer but nobody plays it as one 99 of servers are gamemodes like wasteland epoch and altis life gamemodes more suited to grand theft auto than a game with as much potential as arma 3 worse still bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless end game gamemode that nobody plays i was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it s supposed to be and i played a lot on that server but the fps was so bad 25 that i eventually stopped playing stemming from the issue above tactical pvp just isn t a thing there is some tactical pve which i have enjoyed playing but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a 45 you re out of luck 3rd person everyone uses it or rather abuses it it s impossible to get the drop on someone in cqc because he s looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person don t play it you might say that s impossible because i have never seen a public server with it disabled don t use it you might say again impossible because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when i come around the corner unless i use 3rd person to look over the wall too updates are a farce game s been out for 2 years and only now we re getting bipods really the dlc is another joke 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns wow bohemia what a deal never half ass two things whole ass one thing ron swanson driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isn t a flat surface plane mechanics are pick up and play guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesn t happen the only saving grace is the combined arms aspect but alone they re terrible to play i m going to stop here because i could go on all day about how this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all i never write long reviews but how much i love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me this game is not worth 50 euro maybe 20 at best the only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game the only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it
