2014 so finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can t be any excuses anymore the game didn t changed much kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something i m not talking about childish comments like your game sucks assetto corsa has the best force feedback and physics out there you feel the car you feel almost everything through the wheel the driving feel is really good but that s all it has developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department but still i want to see subaru nissan ford audi peugeut opel and many more it s a racing game so we need more cars of course i don t want fake 1000 cars like in gt series where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars but i think 100 different cars is a must and it s going the right way yes there re mods but i want professionally created cars tracks not by some amateurs there s no auto updates for the mods so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time and some mods for this game cost money i don t approve payware modsr and will not support it the track selection in vanilla game is not very good but many good tracks were added by with dlc ai it s bad ai is not aware of you they just trying to drive trough you so racing against ai is not very fun at least they ve sorted the difficulty so it s possible to beat ai now even if you make mistakes penalty system is absurd it punishes you every time you go out of track no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track where s the logic behind this i m already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time there re challenges too but they re so hard that there s no fun playing them it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless the best times should be achievable to all players after some practice of course even for those which are playing with keyboard mouse or with a controller not only for aliens online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule oh and forget the game if you re playing with a controller this game must be played with wheel only if you re looking for something similar to forza or gt know that this game is nothing like this challenges are fun but they lose the point when you know they re impossible and you need to be among 0 1 0 5 best racers in the world what s the point trying to beat an impossible time multiplayer it s a joke mp is boring and pointless there s no leaderboards or player profiles no statistics most of the time there re too little servers you just can t find a game you can join the league but it s not fun for a casual player to compete with pros after releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added of course now every mod can ban kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason community is one of the worst ac fanboys are the worst you can t say anything bad about ac or criticize it the game is perfect for them what year is it almost 2015 and there s still no night racing and no weather conditions even gt5 has this and it s some old game made for an old console graphics the cars looks really great but everything else is just bad like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom no leaderboards it is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world find your country and try to beat the time there are few game modes career which consists of races and time attacks it will take some time for you to complete it and you ll try the cars time attack it s some broken game mode which makes you go slower the slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get drift and drag racing which i m not interested in so i can t say anything about them another small annoying things when in photo mode you can t hide the racing line mouse pointer do not disappear while playing can t pause the game and check apps racing line is completely broken you can have some fun in career mode and in mp with friends but besides that i can t see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan i m still trying to like this game and i ve spent a lot of time in this game and i still play it but it lacks so many things it has some really attractive things and hope kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans pros great physicsgood graphicsgood performancesetup sharingcons no workshop supportno leaderboardsshallow career modechallenges are impossible for a normal human being
