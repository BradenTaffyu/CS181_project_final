2022 i have spent too many hours on this game the game itself is a lot of fun but there are some rather frustrating issues and scummy business practices the first issue is that the game is very exclusive and performance based and by performance i m referring to player performance good players are rewarded and bad players are punished if you go into a game head out onto the map and get yourself blown up in one hit by an experienced player before you can even fire a shot you either have to go back to the main menu or spawn in one of your other vehicles and you need to pay for the repair costs or wait for 12 24 hours for a free repair if you perform very well you gain a lot of progress if you perform poorly you lose progress you still gain some research points but you ll never be able to buy a new vehicle better hope you don t have a streak of bad games the second issue amplifies the first there is no ranking system in this game good players do not face off against other good players in other words every game you have a chance of facing at least a handful of players who are much better at the game than you are unless you yourself are very good at the game it is entirely possible to go 10 straight games earning negative progress then there s the scummy business practices you can buy premium vehicles only available with real money most of the unique vehicles like the katyusha panzerwerfer or calliope rocket systems are premium vehicles there is no way to earn most of these no matter how long you play you can buy camouflage with real money to place on your tank and you can place twice as many pieces on your tank as a paying monthly subscriber turning your tank into a mobile bush giving you a significant advantage they have repeatedly disabled the ability to chat in the game because they don t want to deal with moderating their own game they have a daily login reward that spins like a casino wheel showing you what great rewards you could get and then usually landing on some 10 booster that will expire unless you keep playing the whole game is designed to get you to grab that credit card to be able to get anywhere i have unlocked rank 4 tanks with one faction after 400 hours of gameplay there are 7 ranks yes there s quite a bit of content but it s locked behind hundreds or thousands of hours unless you grab that credit card the last issue is the battle rating br system in virtually every single game that i play there are people with vehicles 1 0 br higher than my highest vehicle i frequently play with 5 3 vehicles like the panther or tiger tank and always go up against several 6 3 tanks like the is 6 these tanks simply obliterate mine in one hit while i can scarcely scratch their paint this further amplifies the other issues already mentioned this last bit is entirely my opinion and should not be regarded as fact it is quite clear to me that gaijin is either pro russian or have no sense of gameplay balancing over their desire to keep the game as true to realism as possible mid to late ww2 russian tanks are simply better than german tanks this was true in reality and this is true in this game the difference is in reality the germans still performed quite well against the ussr because their tank crews had a few years of experience already meanwhile the soviets had just done the great purge which meant they had to rely on poor inexperienced leadership and tank crews the t34 was superior to the versions of the panzer iii and iv available to the germans at the time but they were still a match due to the difference in experience this is not accounted for in this game the t34 is simply better the is 2 to is 6 are better than the panther g tiger i and tiger ii i don t expect anyone to read all of this novel nor agree with all of it nor be swayed not to play this game because of it i wrote it mostly to get my frustrations with this game out peace
