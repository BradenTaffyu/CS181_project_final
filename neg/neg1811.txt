2017 game is great but gaijin traes its customers like garbage my account got hacked from russia as they happens often to hundreds of accounts in batches we caught this in minutes the hacker just spent all my golden eagles in stupid stuff the answer from gaijin is its our responsability to keep account safe and they wont restore anything stolen now my password is a very safe one yet it got forced my account is from spain where it has always been logged in from someone logs from buriatia next tomongolia and gaijin doiesnt have even the most basic security check like blocking the acces until confirmed legitimate be very careful to spend any money in this game you will llose it all and they dont give a ratss ass about their customers
