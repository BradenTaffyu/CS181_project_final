2022 so i ve been playing this game since launch and i enjoy it for the most part but the honey moon is over and it s starting to get bad i knew f2p currency was going to be bottlenecked after the first days it s a gacha game after all but seeing that you don t even get rewards from ranked reset is absurd i feel like i m being punished for getting to platinum since i didn t get a reward for the reset and i m losing out on all the gems from beginner to gold ranks login rewards are also kinda bad since they should give you more gems per day to keep players logging in rather than decreasing the amount as days go by add to that that there s not even a casual mode which is nuts i feel like they re dropping the ball they should ve done better taking into account how the game exploded in popularity i ll keep playing it to see how it goes i think the first event will be the break point if you really want to play it look for a video on how to spend your gems you ll not regret it like i did editing my review a day later because they addressed the ranked situation and are going to compensate players still gonna mantain my not recommended for now that is until i see what the event is all about and because i still stand by my other points such as no casual mode final edit event was pretty nice gave a lot of rewards and banned a lot of annoying cards and aside from self burn decks i got to see some cool variety and had fun i have to say the game still needs some tweaking it needs that casual play and duel rooms are not it it probably won t change the other stuff i had problems with like rewards being given less and less as you progress because gacha but i m hoping events will be constant and varied edit to end all edits game is still pretty bad no new cosmetics no rank rewards no ban lists events give gems and no other cool stuff like cosmetics again it s just really boring now
