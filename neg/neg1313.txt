2020 early access review i disapprove of the behavior of the people who maintain and develop this game their private interests and tastes taint the game like a stinky mildew on a piece of meat there s this certain gravitation toward politics and expressing a holier than thou sentiment that can be further explored by interacting with these people directly social media their discord servers etc it s like a miasma lingering faintly in the background while only just being present enough to preventing you from playing the way you want to because they don t want you to play that way don t get me wrong you can fix it with mods but you can just as equally expect to face scrutiny because of course they d tied their arbitrary limitations to politics this is not a joke or a metaphor this is quite actually the case you cannot play certain factions or do certain things within the game because they place their political ideals over a good game it s generally fun and has depth but don t buy it if you can help it
