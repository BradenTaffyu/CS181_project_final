2018 this game is the personification of the cancer of the eyes beyond the art style appealing fantasy world and cooperative features lies a game with a heart of darkness whose sole purpose is tormenting the player the game is unfair it s bosses are broken and irritating to fight resources require too much effort to extract for the little benefit ou get from them hitboxes are very poor and have always been flawed with no sign of being fixed there is a line to draw between challenging and pointlessely difficult and unfair there s a reason as to why having mods is a nessecity to play the multiplayer even with mods the game s bosses mechanics hitboxes and resource extraction is castratingly hard i would rather give myself a quadruple bypass with a rusted dull scalpel than have to endure this tragedy of a game
