2021 edit 19 11 21 i ve repurchased the game following the hotfix that was put out recently nothing was immediate or hot about it it was more of a patch and my opinions of the game are now neutral and i wish it was possible to leave a neutral review on steam i will leave this as a negative review for the time being as i assume people looking through negative reviews are doing so to look for any sort of critique for a game so here s my experiences after the hotfix dropped one positive thing that i can say is that game crashes and being disconnected from online are much less frequent making it actually possible to play in a convoy with your friends now however other players will still disappear randomly even if they are in your convoy this extends to even the eliminator i won a game of it without seeing a single other person despite the fact i wasn t going out of my way to try and hide racing online with your friends seems to also work a little better although i encountered a hilarious one off bug with one of my mates being desynced and falling out of the sky on a flat road right in front of me that isn t to say that i haven t had a few disconnects though and i ve only had one game crash if you want to do massive skill chains to get accolades for them you re still better off doing it offline as if you get disconnected half way people are still losing all of their points for no reason but at least your car won t be stopped dead in the process something else that has come up that wasn t present at the time of my original review is that there are a lot of cheaters now on rival s leaderboards on the accolades hall of fame and even in online races fh4 had it s fair share of cheaters in rival time trials and online too but it s even more blatant in this game with far more people doing it with people having very visible speed hacks in races and rivals laptimes of under a tenth of a second the top 100 to 200 times are all cheaters depending on how many people have done it and as for the monthly rivals this extends beyond the top 500 all being cheated times it s not a huge problem as this isn t meant to be a competitive game ranked online modes have been removed but i still like doing hotlaps from time to time and seeing how fast i can go wheel support at least for me is hit and miss i still often have to unplug and replug my wheel several times to get force feedback but obviously this won t be a concern if you exclusively play this game with a controller custom control profiles still aren t being remembered the last thing i have to say for now that isn t necessarily a bug or exploit is that i hate what they ve done with horizon arcade the new forzathon live there s no notification of when they start anymore because there will be multiple arcades per hour instead of having one every hour on the hour like in the last game not only that but there will also be two completely separate arcades lasting 10 minutes each rather than one lasting 15 in fh4 combine that with the goals being ridiculously high it s almost impossible to get it done for the festival playlist unless there s a large group of players all taking part however that s not likely to happen outside of asking a lot of friends to join you because there s no notification for them this is a serious oversight on the developers as i ve seen more people doing forzathon live in fh4 on a consistent basis even if there wasn t anything super valuable in the forzathon shop all things considered would i recommend this game now based on how the average player would play the game and what they would care about most yes especially if you have friends to play it with and i ve changed this review to a positive one to reflect that even though my views on this game are still neutral the average player probably doesn t really care about setting the fastest times in rivals or the cheaters online or wheel support because they would be spending most of their time playing with friends most likely or customising cars or going through the campaign events and a few custom events too i anticipate the developers will address other important issues that haven t been fixed yet in the future but if you re reading this and debating on whether or not to buy the game here s my verdict if you re more casual about things and intend to primarily play with friends i would recommend fh5 if you are going to play mostly or entirely on controller i would also recommend fh5 if you re going to be playing mostly alone i m not sure for a game that has had over 10 million people play it fh5 sure does feel empty on the online side of things with servers not showing that many players if you re the kind of player who likes to do some competitive racing or hotlaps don t bother i don t think they will add a proper anti cheat system and remove illegitimate laptimes or scores anytime soon if you re going to be playing this with a wheel i would also say don t bother it s seriously frustrating to unplug and replug my wheel several times in several usb slots until the ffb decides that it wants to work and then having to set my custom control profile again every time i launch the gamei ll update this review one more time after another update inevitably comes out to fix more problems and change my recommendation accordingly original review gameplay in premium early access period fh5 has a solid foundation to be a good game but right now i can t recommend it too many problems with not enough urgency behind fixing them which has caused me to refund it when it works it works very well the suspension and tyre model physics are improved from fh4 force feedback on wheels is better once adjusted especially off road but instead of fixing any of the actual problems that players are experiencing they d rather fix the bloody treasure map of all things there are stability issues issues with multiplayer namely convoys and horizon life not working custom controls and preferences not being remembered and having to be set every time you start wheel support being hit and miss a feature the devs specifically said they have improved with me having to unplug and replug my wheel to get ffb to work also taking part in horizon arcade the new forzathon live will cause your game to crash if you weren t there at the very start and they decided to reduce it down to 10 minutes from 15 for some reason i will pick this game up once the issues have been addressed but for the time being you need to vote with your money if things will ever change with broken game releases don t buy this game if you haven t already wait for the devs to fix it
