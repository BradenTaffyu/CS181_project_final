2022 i have never been so frustrated by a video game before this is one of my absolute favorite games civ 6 is not only the best civ game i have played but one of the best strategy games the base game is amazing the dlcs are amazing the gameplay is phenomenal however the number of bugs and the frequency of crashes present in this game are completely unacceptable considering that the game has been out for 6 years and costs 300 total for the base game and all its dlcs when not on sale i m sick and tired of trying to find a solution to an issue that 2k clearly doesn t give a sh about apparently the game was fine until 2k arbitrarily decided they needed to use their own garbage launcher and now the game barely functions get your sh together 2k treat your customers with just a tiny bit of respect and put some fu effort into fixing the issues that you caused in your expensive ass video game instead of presumably devoting your time and resources into developing your next sh show money grab i love this game with all my heart i just wish i could play it
