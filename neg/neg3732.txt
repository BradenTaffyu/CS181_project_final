2018 early access review this game is an embarassment every update completely breaks hitboxes and reinvents features that didn t need to be touched i ve patiently waited while this game figured itself out but this recent update is unabashed trash i m absolutely floored how the developers can spend a year and half on an update and make the game even worse i m so fed up with this perpetual early access dumpster fire
