2023 tldr this game is not even close to as good as payday 2 or payday the heist the devs have no idea what makes a payday game good and are untalented hacks shills can say otherwise but this game is dead lmao biggest issues no offline play always online not pier 2 pier like pd th and pd2 no lobby creation no crime net not enough content bad progression bad skill system many bad skills lackluster released planned dlc planned mtx currency payday credits c stacks currency no option to unready in lobby yes really edit unready button was added in a patch on february 29th 2024 162 days after launch lmao gameplay issues weapon accuracy bloom your guns accuracy goes down after every shot to the point where you can miss a shot at point blank range pistols suffer the most from this as you cannot sustain fire without your bullets going sideways recoil can be worked around but this cannot the gunplay would be somewhat satisfying if it wasn t for how punishing accuracy bloom is no armor regen armor is now a resource that does not regen armor is so much tankier than health that it is the new health bar in a way as a result it is detrimental to bring anything other than an armor bag weapon leveling locking attachments behind weapon xp is a feature only added to extend playtime and inconvenience the player which is especially jarring considering most of the mods make little impact on how well the gun performs weapon customization weapon stats are displayed with bars so it is impossible to tell how much of a difference mods make most mods have downsides for no reason and tons of them make targeting ads take longer no melee you can weapon bash enemies but it does no damage even payday the heist had functioning melee lol short heists all heists can be completed in 10 15 minutes dumbed down stealth stealth has less depth and is far more forgiving than pd2 stealth many skills trivialize it and people only believe it is better because it requires less thinking planning stealth difficulty limiting the amount of available pagers radios to spend and adding a guard that follows rng pathing is not a legitimate way to balance stealth difficulty 4 pagers was just fine in pd2 and it was still challenging 2 pagers is ridiculous hacking circles i don t know who thought this was a good idea but it completely ruins the pacing of loud and stealth gameplay standing in a circle to complete an objective is not better than the classic drill many other issues not mentioned here are mentioned in other reviews available downs it isn t displayed in the armor descriptions but heavier armor has less downs and lighter armor has more this should be removed completely overkill weapons as others have said this addition is very cod esque and doesn t belong in a payday game but since they are going to keep it i d say there should be a slot for it instead of having them sit on the ground after switching weapons if overkill weapons occupied a slot then after being picked up every overkill delivery would instead deliver ammo for that weapon the few improvements subjective deployable and tool slots adding an extra slot for tools could be used in the future to give players a wider range of equipment at the moment it is only useful for stealth sonic mines are very situational motion sensor would be better if it lasted forever the stealth tools that are in game are nice besides the ecm still even with the new additions it is still neutered compared to how it was in pd2 movement i d say it is smoother than pd2 s movement in some aspects but sliding is kinda useless lol gun sounds certain types of guns sound better like the shoguns and rifles pistols and smgs need to have their sounds improved though unmasked stealth a nice feature but it needs to be reworked as it is kinda op lockpicking safe cracking nice changes additions that are definitely an improvement over waiting for a circle to fill up lol human shields the ability to use civs and law enforcement as human shields is a perfect addition and i hope they expand upon it beyond the lackluster skills they have for it music some of the tracks are good but some are forgettable or painful like 99 boxes with all this considered the game sucks compared to payday the heist and payday 2 the devs don t seem to realize what is wrong with their game and see their design decisions changes as good and have been extremely opaque about development maybe they ll turn it around in 2 3 years idk but this disastrous launch will not be forgotten and they should be ashamed if things really change for the better in years time i will change my review but that is unlikely
