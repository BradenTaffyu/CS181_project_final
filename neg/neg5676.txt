2014 rome 2 emperor edition update all patches up toi have not touched this game since last year now being october 2014 i thought i d reinstall it btw that came with alot of issues but i got it to work the emporer edition to the game is a good idea i like the new factions and the story behind them being interested in the time period myself so anyway since rome 2 s early days alot has been improved the ai is starting to think for itself and sometimes picks a good army to field infantry instead of 18 units of missile cavalry archers as we all know how annoying that can be siege ai is much better an can effectivley assault a garrison as much as you d expect from a computer player having said that it could be improved especially when defending when they defend they are still not going to the right areas capture areas the campaign ai is better but still appears to be lost by this i mean randomly appearing to attack then leaves without even a shoe thrown diplomacy is still a disgrace they ll pretty much reject everything until your rich or have alot of military allies don t even get me started on agents ca they are the dumbest thing you ve ever done seriously i understand spying and such but when your capital is surrounded by like 9 spies it s to the point where you can t raise an army in that city of fear he ll be assassinated during your end turn the new politics system however is a much needed improvment on the old and i do quite like it now just to bring back family trees and other roman factions on the gran campaign like in rome 1 so moving on tactics by the ai i ll keep this short and sweet there s alot more of this on other posts i guess 1 i find it extremely annoying when fighting an enemy still if they have a good stack of infantry they won t double up to keep reserves they ll use the entire battlefield to position one battle line 2 why does the ai still run a mile into battle 3 flanking is still 50 50 ai only does it on occasions that i ve noticed 4 testudo doesn t work still roman ai won t use it approaching walls i was never good and paragraphing in college so it s probably a literacy mess up there having said all that i do like the new edition with it s new factions and improved bits but i think ca wasted their time with dlc s and add ons and given us a polished turd a runny one at that rather than really focusing on the real issues here yes i know they keep releasing patches but seriously how long can they keep this up before admitting it s a disgrace oh and what number patch are we even on now it seems they released a game 2 years before it s time and tried to sweeten us up with the extras overall verdict by me a customer among thousands i m sure game release 1 5to date release 2 5quick side note reinstalled it to see if anything changed march 2015 you guessed it not much if anything i can t recall seeing another update patch but anyway if you do decide to read this and give rome a shot make sure you look around on the community mods workshop just discovering them myself properly they are fantastic ca should employ these guys instead of the 40k a year experts
