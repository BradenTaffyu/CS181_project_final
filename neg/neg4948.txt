2020 it took me 102 hours to complete the first campaign granted i think i left the game open while afk a few times so the number might be skewed sadly i just can t be arsed to play another campaign because it feels like such a chore pros the diplomacy is really good you can trade territories you can trade items you can arrange marriages really for me the trade territory feature is something i wish was in previous tw titles you can also click on quick deals and get a list of nations that will accept diplomatic options so rather than going to talk to one at a time to see if they are interested in trade or peace or vassalization or confederation etc you can just get a list this is an amazing feature that i hope continues in the tw series the graphics and sound are very good the level of graphical and sound polish is extremely high early game first 50 turns is by far the most interesting part of the game cons mid to late game is where things become boring having to take at least 95 commanderies and the three seats is just not much fun the ai starts sending really weak armies all over to try to slow down the progression so whack a mole starts to become a thing the generals upgrades and items are just not that interesting after mid game i just didn t want to bother with having tons of characters that have leveled up and now i need to add a skill that won t really matter i m more or less just dominating the enemy turn by turn having to manage the generals and court each turn is fun when you have a handful and you are in early game but mid late game its just boring the buildings also really dont matter just get enough food so you can afford to upgrade the city maybe add garrison or something public order really isn t an issue at all unless you have food or money shortages i really didn t even bother carefully picking buildings or anything just spammed upgrades when needed early game units are just as powerful as late game units making late game unit costs just not even worth it i can t sit down and play another campaign because i know that it will be the same me having fun early game and then the mid late game turning into a complete boring chore i don t want to sit here clicking upgrade buttons every turn and playing whack a mole the ai was not threatening at all mid game either
