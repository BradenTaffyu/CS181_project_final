2021 early access review the game is unique you will not find any game that plays like 7d2d most probably the best fps openworld survival building zombie game why the best because it s the only one it is the only one that give you such freedom in doing whatever you want no dayz rust or whatever can compare now i m leaving a very negative review on the game due to the developers who ruined their only baby this team is unable to deliver a finished polished product they re unable to respect their own dead lines they do know even know what they want to do with this game absolute incompetent game devs i ve been following this game since a11 and this is a complete sh tshow over 8 years after the first release and the game is still in a broken alpha state this is a disgrace to the gaming community the game should be banned from the steam store for abusing the early access tag there have been other game devs who with less money and in a shorter timespan released a full working title with more content and a much more difficult game to develop i remember well over a year ago when the fun pimps themselves said ok we re taking way too much time for updates we will do them quicker since when is a20 worked on ah yes 10 months 10 months for a couple new zombies and weapons skins none gives a damn about the twitch integration you have been working on for the past 6 months because none plays this game anymore and no streamer would like to show epic gameplay of rock breaking for 30 mins stop changing the basics of your game every update and start taking responsabilities the fun pimps finish the game you made millions from before talking about other projects your game is fundamentally broken unfinished and has no goal at all you are a disgrace to the gaming community
