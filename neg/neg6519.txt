2017 dark souls 3 is a great game for all who loved the series and is especially more forgiving to newcomers the game has a greater focus on gameplay and less emphasis on story which basically means less talking and more killing the pc port brings us better framerate and graphics and that adds to the beauty of this gem i definitely recommend anyone who wants a game with great mechanics to buy this game and play it offline on the pc port the online gameplay is utter cancer how so many hackers are allowed to roam free without any repercussions is beyond me you will literally despise being invaded or invading players that either clip through attacks have infinite fp or stamina or just ghost through the entire area literally unkillable how steam or from allows this nonsense to go on unchecked and letting these hackers get away with all this is beyond me i m all for the modding community that wishes to mod their game but for the love of god leave that for offline play seriously steam or from anyone ban modded saves from being playable online and let people play in peace oh other than that this is a great game and you should definitely buy it for a great experience offline until those hacking bastards are banned from any online play
