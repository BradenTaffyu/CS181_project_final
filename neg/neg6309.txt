2023 overrated game of the yeari know this will piss many people off seeing almost everyone loved this game and most of my friends as well but i don t care hogwarts legacy is nothing more qualified than a ubisoft title okay maybe a little bit more than that it s ridiculous how people call ubisoft s copy paste open world content trash and praise hogwarts bland content just because it is harry potter in hogwarts legacy the developers tried adding some breath of the wild shrine like puzzles merline trials which consist of 6 7 types and are no brainers you memorize them and the rest is a matter of finding butterflies or other objects needed to pass the trial simply they are fetch quests rather than actual puzzles moreover they implemented some of elden ring s caves mini dungeons because they had to do that too after elden ring s success which is fighting the same enemies and mini boss again and again for some not so rewarding randomly generated loot at the end this definitely is not an rpg where you can make your own path despite the developers saying so it s an open world action adventure game yes you can upgrade and find new gear if that makes this game an rpg but none of your choices matter devs saying you might even be a bad guy is also untrue here regardless of whatever you do you re the hero in the end here is an example from my experience during the side quests i first offered people help for free but after realizing that it would not change anything at all i began charging them this is the first time that i asked for money in return from people in any videogame i played that s how serious this is you don t give your character s personality a form your characters bearsonal ity is already settled and you are simply a boring npc what else you don t get rewarded or praised for not casting unforgivable spells or punished for casting them there is not even a single dialogue that condemns you for using these forbidden spells even if you couldn t add anything for that matter you could have just added an achievement that said complete the game without using the unforgivable spells you should have done at least that developers you may wander in the forbidden forest for days and perform unforgivable spells all the time however none of your professors will warn you or say anything to you about that matter the main story is terrible the storytelling and characters are dull and lifeless and the side quest stories are not interesting either terrible villain like almost all games who is not given enough attention another lazy design is how professors teach you spells in exchange for fetch quests bleh there is a day and night cycle but that does not affect vendors they will always be waiting for you to shop there are not many people at the castle at night that s all this game should have just been around hogwarts castle and not focused on the open world combat is fun at first but gets fairly boring after 20 hours it s because of the lack of spell and enemy variety dumb ai and a combat system that s not very exciting traversing through the map is also a breeze after you have acquired the broom there is no danger that you cannot handle all you have to do is fly up if you want to get out of combat not like there is any threat for you in the map there are no dragons goblins that use brooms or any other enemy type that can counter your easy way out of battle so flying is boring too the game s marketing led me to believe that this would be persona but harry potter even if it wouldn t be exactly what i hoped i would expect so much more to do as a student inside hogwarts than what you actually can i hoped for a game that you had to go to classes in specific times where there was authority a similar experience to bully that would have made the game way better you cannot interact with any person other than a few predetermined ones in addition you can not spend time with your friends as much as you want sleep do homework legitimate homework not fetch quests eat food in the hall or explore the magical or should i say unalive castle of hogwarts hogwarts castle is visually appealing however it feels dead inside you don t feel like you are a student instead you feel like i am the chosen one and the hero of this world common rooms are useless there is nothing to do inside them or any reason to spend time in them at all hogwarts castle is filled with invisible walls overall a bland atmosphere throughout the map there are no puzzles i wouldn t call those no brainer merlin trials or alohomora locks puzzles there are many collectibles in the world as well which are obviously artificial game lengtheners there is no immersion at all wasted potential optimization sucks how tf can this game use 23gb of ram at times it s inexplicable constant frame drops and stutters all over the place graphics are okay feels like early ps4 era at most lighting is terrible to conclude the major issue with hogwarts legacy is its game design and the lack of detail almost everywhere it doesn t do the player any favors to direct them in every mission with the minimap and various hints that is not how you lead the player into exploration i can t have fun in any long lasting 50 hours long open world game after experiencing botw rdr2 and elden ring not only is the open world very poor content wise it is also not visually appealing i disagree with those who say there is great art direction in hogwarts legacy it looks just like the far cry 5 map full of copy paste trees and zero points of interest in hogwarts legacy where can the player look and say what s that interesting looking thing over there just like how we all said in elden ring or breath of the wild regarding hogwarts because everything is already marked on your map for you you just open the map mark your next quest and follow the path by tracking the minimap with your eye as a result the urge to explore disappears what s there to explore when you 100 know what you are going to find developers it s 2023 learn from the innovative and successful examples around you bronze medalfollow my curator page
