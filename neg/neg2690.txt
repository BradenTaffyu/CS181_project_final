2022 at this point i have one play through and 3 played species overall i guess that is enough for an informed opinion first of all i like the game for the feeling of realism you get when playing it the variety of species events and play stiles is great lots and lots of ideas for scifi novels i will never write formed in my head during the last weeks and months when it was my main game be it the mega corporation xenophile merchant or evil military empire you name it you can play it i really enjoyed most of my time with the game but why do i not recommend it first of all you get the full experience only if you play with all or at least most of the dlcs ok some seem optional but then you miss out important parts that you will possibly expect the game to have this is quite annoying because the base game costs 40 and most of the dlcs cost 10 or more each ok you can get all of it cheaper on steam sales but even then it is quite a lot when summed up what bothers me even more is that some of the features of these dlcs should have been part of the base game or are so badly implemented that it hurts e g slavemarket and espionage instead they are main features of dlcs you pay extra money for the thing that actually brought me to stop playing is the bad user experience while it is not a problem to manage 4 or 5 planets it gets quite frustrating if you have 40 50 or even more one example if you have jobless people in one of your colonies and want to relocate them to other colonies you have a dialog with two lists the first list contains all people living in the currently selected colony and on list for people in another colony you can change this selection only with a drop down that contains all your colonies there is no search at all and the drop down is not even ordered alphabetically and seems to change its content as soon as you select another colony now imagine how tedious this gets with 40 colonies and more same with slaves you want to see which slaves got criminal to sell them you have to go through all your colonies for all species separately you want to give slaves better working conditions in your colonies you have to do this for each type separately you want to delete fleets the computer created automatically but does not contain any ships you have to select each fleet press x and confirm deletion that gets even funnier as the leader of a federation where you get lots and lots of fleets that contain only one or two ships if you click wrong you lose ships if you don t clean the fleets the fleet manager is barely usable you want to downgrade space stations then delete by pressing delete on the keyboard not x like you did in the fleetmanager in some cases this removes the whole station which why you will loose a whole star system these are all things you will do increasingly often as further you get in the game and it causes more and more frustration i mean the main entry point for information about ships colonies spacestations political factions and fleets is one list on the right side of the screen that does not even allow you to search anything but it is not only the ux the ai acts in silly ways to the leader of my federation for example opened a war to force his beliefs on another species this war raged for 50 years from which we only fought 10 the reason for this was that the targeted specie was only willing to accept if all its colonies are captured unfortunately the leader and every other member of the federation did not capture any colony and so i had to put raiding parties together drive to each of the 60 solar systems of our opponent and capture one planet after the other only to get nothing in return what a fun the whole game feels to me as it was playtested only with smaller factions and only for 100 years or so lots of game mechanics and the overall performance crumble into pieces if you play larger empires and for a long time even the ai gets dumper and more predictable as longer you play i can t accept that because the game is getting new dlcs over and over again but no one bothered to fix all these issues in the base game and user experience ok they changed alot of the gamemechanics and thus we are on version 3 now but this made it only even more complicated to find into the game thats because you can not trust many of the online tutorials meanwhile the basic issues in the ux department are still relevant and untouched
