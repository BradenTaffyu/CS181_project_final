2018 was great before 2 0 when it felt more like its own game more like a grand strategy space sim now with the changes to ftl it feels and plays more like a typical bland 4x rts game there s basically now only one correct way to play and if you don t play it that way you will be punished by the game in the form of getting your ass handed to you by your ai neighbours very early on it s very rushed now too before you could play at a much more sedate calculating pace but now it s a frantic rush to claim systems and survive against neighbours who in my experience have always been hostile and with the bonuses the ai gets can easily outproduce you and maintain much bigger fleets despite being the same size as you this basically turns the game into a franctic unfun slog right from the start and once you re done surviving that neighbour you run into more hostile empires so rinse and repeat and just fight endless wars in the narrow confines of the hyperlane system you re forced to use the empires that aren t hostile are either useless or just get in your way in the sense that they re not hostile enough to declare war but not friendly enough to be allies i was really hoping they d take the game down a more ck2 route with more life and simulation in the galaxy e g galactic councils trade etc and more interesting ways to interact with the rest of the galaxy but it seems paradox are determined to turn stellaris into more and more of a space rts edit the latest dlcs and moves toward having a galactic community federations are a good step in the right direction if i could i d change my recommendation to maybe
