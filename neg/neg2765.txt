8 years of development and the game is still in a terrible state performance is horrible barely uses any cpu cores paradox is again busy with pushing juicy money dlcs instead of making their game playable 500 pops or a max size fleets will cause terrible lags for some reason no matter the cpu used you can only play smaller worlds smaller timespan fewer ais small sectors else it will result in crippling performance around the end game does not matter how good your cpu is the game simply only uses 1 core no matter what many people including the idiot who gave me the clown award do not even play the game until endgame or often do not play bigger maps the people who say the performance is not an issue are clowns themselves i have asked some of them and it is always the same story they do not play the game they simply start a game and fool around a little bit before they start a new game or play on smallest maps few ai opponents etc definetly last paradox game for me
