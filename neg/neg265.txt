originally i defended this game thinking that the issues upon launch was entirely deep silvers fault for trying to turn this game into a live service one as well as the dlc that changed when starbreeze announced their operation medic bag to fix the bugs of the game instead of fixing them they added things not a single person asked for as well as adding things like quickplay or stay as a team after the heist which should ve been in the game day 1 can t filter quickplay most of the time when you use stay as a team it dosen t even work i ve played the payday games since the armored truck heists came out in payday this isn t the developer i once knew and paid for every single dlc they released even if it was garbage or i never even used them i just wanted to support a developer i loved f ck starbreeze f ck overkill f ck deep silver they ruined this franchise and operation body bag is just a slap in the face to the diehard fans of this community i can t believe i sunk hundreds of hours into payday 2 grinding day after day to get 100 100 i don t even want a refund i just wish i knew before i grinded day after day that this company would throw itself off a cliff edit so the dlc came out and starbreeze has said money is tight all around the world we ll be changing our prices to reflect this therefore they lowered the prices for 5 5 whole dollars just release all year 1 dlc for free as compensation personally i m not interested in paying another cent for anything made by starbreeze or overkill until this happens people who bought the game and silver edition and have gone through these horrible development choices deserve this
