2020 early access review project zomboid is so close and yet so far from being a phenomenal game i ve backed pz since 2011 and for a few years i d read through all the updates npcs have been promised since 2014 and over 12 years later it still hasn t happened and the game is still somehow in early access indie stone truly show you how not to do game development and there s literally no excuse for it not to be polished and finished the game functions almost exactly how it did back in 2013 2014 menus are mostly the same bugs are mostly the same content hasn t changed much other than adding a few new things here and there to make up for the lack of qol updates simple fixes and other things that the devs simply couldn t and or didn t want to do they left it up to the workshop modders what indie stone do have is an incredible foundation for a game but that s where it stops there are some many features that could have been fixed polished or added over the last 12 years that for some reason haven t and indie stone have made excuses for 12 years straight there s still fun to be had in the game but you ll have to overlook a lot of little frustrating details like not being able to drop x number of items from your inventory or hell not even being able to sit on any in game furniture it s still only 20 of what the game could be in the hands of the right developers but indie stone isn t it you can have fun here especially playing with friends the map is insanely huge and the buildings are varied but all the little bugs terrible ui slow animations and even having to port forward for multiplayer in 2023 like what is this the developers simply put are lazy slow and don t know how what to prioritize this game was truly saved by some big youtubers and streamers finding it just hire some proper experienced devs to fix the game and make it what it could be because the current dev leads certainly can t it s been 12 years npcs will never come to this game
