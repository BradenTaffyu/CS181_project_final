2022 i got auto surrendered because i fell asleep after waiting for eternity for my opponent turn to end aside from the ungodly long time per turn this game is actually fun if you play with your friends using fun decks not with some tryhards using meta deck and combo that last for eternity good for try hard for casual players like me not so much
