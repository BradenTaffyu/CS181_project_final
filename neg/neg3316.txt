2016 i m a big fan of the series but they dumbed down almost every element of the game compared to hoi 3 2 this may makes the game more accessible but it ruins all of the joy and long term motivation of the game the new game should allways have more and better working features than the predecessor not less main issues are bad very very bad ai how come the ai has become worse than in the previous games the lines of ai generals look like swiss cheese and as long as they feel superior in numbers they keep attacking in the most self destructing ways without any regard for there losses and the value of the gained position and now you have to rely on this stupid ai because micromanagment has become all messed up same goes for diplomatic ai when soviets can stroll trough axis territory depsite beeing on the brink of war with them and capture south africa from the allies you start wondering why they delayed this game for a year how bad can it have been before no more support attacks no more planed arrivals or sheduled attack times for multiple divisions the manual stategic movement and shipment of troops is completly messed up the trading system is a warcrime why must i buy 8 pcs when i only need one and why can t even isolated dictatorships decided what they want to export to the world market and tho whom what was wrong with the old trading system no more sending air or battleship support to a single important fight now you have to order them to ridiculously big regions and loose all oversight for ground forces you have no chance to count your losses and compare them to the losses of your enemies after a battle ends ever heard of the term war of attrition paradox what happened to all the statisitcs you could get in the previous games the new map sure looks nice but without terrain and weather filters it is useless for placing and moving your troops this takes the rest of joy out of micromanagment missing or broken supply system for fleets and air wings fleets can move and fight for years despite beeing cut off from friendly harbours the few improvments the new production and equipment system the only thing that became more complex compared to the older games they added peace conferences like in europa universalis the focus tree system is very helpfull in customising your nation you can now stage armed coups in any other countryin grand strategy i do not need fancy toyplanes flying over my map give me a working ai i recomend you wait untill they fix this game as allways with their countless dlcs and then buy a hopefully playable gold edition
