2023 post ending review update so after finishing the game i ll be still not recommending this game to other player for a lot of different reasons even month after the release there are still countless bugs the story in chapter 4 and 5 is mediocre at best the difficulty level is way too low after mid chapter 2 90 of the fights were finished in 1 round some boss encounters required 2 or 3 rounds due to some mechanics making them invulnterable in one way or another without those mechanics 1 round on highest difficulty for hardest bosses is just waaay too easy initial review it s currently a buggy mess a lot of skills just don t work or work incorrectly i had to restart the campaign because my playthrough was bricked while being on the second playthrough and finding out that my origin planet death world s talent doesn t work i decided to just stop playing for now i absolutely regeret buying the game with all the previous ones i bought them only when they became available in the final version to avoid exactly such a situation of struggling with bugs that s what i ll be doing from now on with future games from this company edit1 just to be clear i m not saying not to buy it just not to buy it yet until all the bugs are fixed edit2 just logged in after the 1 0 1 update and a lot of things are still bugged for example dont pick death world for the origin if you decide to play the ability still doesn t work edit3 tried it again with 1 0 78 still absolute trash 0 mechanics were fixed they re still fixing the quests which makes sense since those bugs just straight out brick your runs still it s an absolute disgrace they re incapable to provide any mechanics fixes weeks after the release honestly stay away wait for like half a year wait until it s on a huge sale 50 done waste your money on that pile of g which it definitely is right now just check out the bug thread on reddit it s longer than the whole storyline edit4 it s mostly playable finishing the game before revising my review
