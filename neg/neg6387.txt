2021 i really hate to check the do not recommend box but at this point i kind of need to first you should know that this game is a huge improvement over fh4 in just about every way graphics are gorgeous terrain and race tracks are much more varied and characterful they seem to have fixed the issues with convoys and multiplayer queues crashing we used to average around one race every hour trying to play competitive in a convoy tons of stuff to do for everybody whether that be drifting road racing or just roaming around and exploring so many positive things it s hard to overstate how impressed i am the reason i have to vote no right now is the most important aspect of any racing game the racing right now the game is making such an attempt to be new user friendly that what you actually do in a race really has no real impact it doesn t matter if you carefully upgrade a track weapon lovingly tune it and then drive like a zen master you will do exactly as well as someone who takes a car without upgrades and just barrels around the track wildly crashing into every wall and corner the ai will also smooth their performance to how well you are doing did you bring a 260 mph top speed missile every ai driver will be able to do 265 even in tiny little cars with a quarter of your horsepower that are designed to be nimble instead of fast did you bring a darty little car and plan to earn places in the corners every ai will take that same corner flat out even when in massive muscle cars that should struggle to complete gentle corners when every car feels roughly the same when your level of effort and knowledge in building them don t matter and when how you drive them has no real impact in how you place then what s the point i m really hoping this is an initial bug to be worked out if the situation improves i will joyfully recommend this game but until that happens be aware that a twelve year old picking up the controller for the very first time will be actively competitive against someone with 1000 hours of racing experience under their belt may as well just watch gameplay videos at that point
