2018 game crashed and lost progress checked discussion forum and this happened to a lot of people the devs knew about this issue since probably april 2017 and it s still not fixed the devs wrote on the forum that we should backup our save files every once in a while to prevent losing progress guess what most people checking the gaming issue part of forum is there because it already happened and their game progress lost it s such a shame that it s been more than half a year and this issue continues instead of making more money out of dlcs maybe fix the bugs so people don t suddenly lose what they have been fighting for in the game it was so disheartening when it happened to me people invest their time and effort but never know when all they have achieved are just gonna disappear not the kind of game i want to play other than that it s a beautiful game if you are willing to take the risk
