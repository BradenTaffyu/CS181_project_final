2020 early access review i love this game i truly do but unless all you want is combat don t get this game yet i can only say yes to people who only care about war this is also the audience i think the devs want because politics land management trade smithing and rogue characters are all dependant on also being fighters here is what i like combat has never been so good in a game like this i cannot explain how good it feels to lead an army of khurzait lancers down the steppes into the front line of some poor army graphics its not jaw dropping but it is great to look at new skill tree has alot of promise shame most of the perks dont work here is what i dislike its a sandbox where the only thing to do is fight now i know that has always been the mount and blade way but come on why add a smithing and trade tree if their only purpose is to make more money purely for fights when the easiest way to make money on this game is selling high end equipment you get from fighting armies politics comes down to win fights to get influence to spend to get settlements from under other people for no money cost factions factions confuse me the imperials especially they are clearly based off of the romans but their armour and weapons look like a blend between roman inspired but eastern design they could be placeholder armours and god i hope so the vlandians are a mix of calridians and rhodoks but less interesting than both in my opinion the sturgians are fine and are nords the battanians are clearly brittons but their middle tear troops look like medieval english bowmen but their higher tier troops look like they are from a different time period or at least i get that feeling i am not too big of english history town and castle ownership is a joke all they do really is give you money and what is money good for only war or making more money there is no land to own and manage really no charity to increase your towns respect for you or morale trade the trade perk made me believe my first character could focus on trading and smithing due to there being that perk too but smithing takes about 1200 days ingame time of smelting every weapon you get and making ores in ingots to get to level 200 to where you get some decent perks that allow you to make weapons that turn a profit worth selling how ever once you have all the money you could ever want there is nothing to do unless you then want to take your weak ass character who has no combat skills to war you can t own a mansion or house and upgrade it to reflect your wealth and standing as the game goes own raise your kids or stash your gear if you want to stash gear you literally have to have an entire bloody castle relations this is broken currently the only way to get your relation up with characters is to murder their armies then let them go or do missions that doesnt sound so bad until you learn that your wife husband will stay at 0 like dislike towards you even as you have kids and then they die mods i love mods mods are what got me into pc gaming when i saw how much they could add to games i loved why is this a bad side because go to the nexus and see how much work modders have done in their free time out of passion they fix or add things that havent been done yet or things that weren t fixed until later literally a day after the game came out a mod was made that let you make axes and maces it took the devs like 3 4 days to make that in a patch now i am sure the devs are hard at work and have much love for their game but come one what went wrong during development where so much was broken that was clearly so easily fixed i am giving this a negative because people looking at games usually read the negatives first because they are the ones that usually go into detail like i said above if you want an indepth rpg game where you can be or do anything you shouldn t get this yet until they update it more hell you might never get this because i have the dreadful feeling war is the only thing the devs really plan on doing anything about i hope i am wrong this game could be playable for years on and off with the same save file if they added more to do but i ask you to do this to anyone who disagrees with me start a new save give yourself 1 million gold and what are your options now there is no point trading because you will never need gold again no point making your own kingdom and going to war because all that does when you win is give you more gold no point doing missions or having children or keeping your villages safe and well done you are now at the end or middle game state for i would wager everyone
