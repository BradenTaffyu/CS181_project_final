2018 i loved this game past tense in order to fix a few things that were broken paradox decided to destroy other things that were not broken at all and they also didn t fix the things that were broken stellaris had an exciting start a slightly tedious midgame and a stellar endgame that gave you something that is rarely seen in 4x games an endcap that you could finish your campaign on or continue playing if you wanted and feel satisfied now the start of the game is slow and tedius i hope you like saving up resources slow and thoughtlessly construct starbases on every single system tedius you want forget the dozens of ways you could design your races to expand in different creative ways now you expand one way all the time you want to create a race of merciless robots that destroy all organic life before you could just consume the galaxy at as you will when you will now well they better have a casus belli freaking really a war justification how about i want to eat you how s that for a justification and make sure all the space nobles think thier claim on those worlds you want to eat is acceptable oh and the mericiless robots also get war fatigue because all this consuming and killing is just such a strain on thier poor robot hearts plus there are innumerable bugs you literally could win every space battle and take more regions than your opponant more often than your opponent and still the game will give you a greater war fatigue for no discernable reason how would you like to play a game where you beat the utter crap out of your opponant in every way and you still lose make sense sound fun what developer in thier right mind would remove content remove player choice with 2 0 you have less choice and less ways to play not more on this alone this gets a not recommend couple that with the bugs and the grinding broing early game now my recommendation is play something else and save your money i know i can revert the game to 1 9 i know most mods will still work maybe i ll do that but honestly i m better to uninstall this game play something else and not give paradox my cash anymore i suggest you do the same
