2016 stellaris is awesome game that has very complex and interesting early game however that s when the fun stops after progressing to mid end game the game lacks some serious content i m giving it thumbs down untill devs fix the current issues pros awesome and unique races different play styles resources are meaningful ships look pretty cool managing planets is fun discovery events at start of game primitive civilizationscons mid end game is very boring there is not much you can do just two boring victory conditions all the cool discovery events and special missions stop appearing after start combat is pretty boring usually the side that has more ships wins same missions keep appearing like the zerg that invade after x years in the end limited options for diplomacy endgame feels rushed compared how awesome the start is dlc is no excuse to leave mid endgame unfinishedtotal graphics 8a i 7gameplay 5 early game 9 tldr awesome early game after that the game becomes very boring and repetitive it feels like the endgame part of the game is not finished
