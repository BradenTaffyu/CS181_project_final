2023 this game is often ludicrously good looking has a very fun and simple gameplay loop and is generally just a chill nice time traipsing through the woods while testing your hunting abilities but i cannot really fully recommend this due to major issues with the audio the spatialisation is just busted the direction which you hear stuff is frequently completely wrong sometimes 180 degrees wrong in a game with otherwise very nice sound design and foley this is a huge shame and it causes real problems in gameplay the game does have a visual indicator thing that shows where sounds are coming from and this is basically essential otherwise you would end up looking in the wrong direction when you hear an animal it s especially annoying with the dog s barking when they re tracking an animal i generally have to bring up the gps map thing to see where he actually is it seems like these this issue with audio spatialisation has been reported for many years now and it hasn t been fixed this really isn t great it s mostly solid otherwise though one bug that keeps happening for me is the weapon and all gear seemingly disappearing from my hands when i make certain inputs in fast sequence and i have to go into the inventory to unequip equip to bring it all back so i can use a gun etc if this happens at a critical moment as an animal is passing by it kind of kills my enthusiasm for the game tbh hopefully this stuff gets sorted sooner rather than later because i really like the game and would like to play more
