2015 it s confusing on one hand i did play 172 hours so far and enjoyed some of it compared to other titles i d say i got my money s worth if solely based on that i would recommend this game unfortunately i m confused because overall despite all the hours played i did not like it the entire thing feels like a mindless uncreative game i can t shake the thought away that if this game had been handled by another team it wouldn t have been the mess that it is now without giving any spoilers the plot storyline is not presented adequately and attempt to dupe the player for a plot twist but ultimately steps on its own feet while trying to do that which leaves major plotholes confusing the player before you can take the final most important decision the game feels uncreative because many of the quests are very repetitive there s little to no place for politics problem solving or plotting the only problem solving is in the form of bullets in your enemie s heads the rpg aspect is very limited too while you can make your own settlements and even equip them with whatever you want which is fantastic they will always treat you like a stranger and will never acknowledge you as a mayor or a superior in any kind of way you have very little power over your settlements and they are quite limited in size there is a size limit to towns which is pretty small you can t choose the type of settlers you want you can t attract visitors and the stores you build are solely for your own use and as far as i know nobody in the wasteland will ever mention anything about your settlement s they will never mention how small and undefended or how great and thriving a settlement is nor will they ever mention you being important rich or powerful or the opposite even if you own every damn town in the wasteland the conversations are also underwhelming while not terrible and often quite enjoyable played as a female character they are just rarely deep enough as if no one in the wasteland had anything to say that would last more than a minute the only npcs that acknowledges anything about your character afaik are the guards minutemens which is fantastic but i wish more important npcs would do as well like vendors or quest related npcs as for the companions they re not very useful and will burn through your ammos if you re not playing a cookie cutter build charisma intellect companion localleader or str end per agi luck dog companion lone wanderer it may be difficult to supply your companion with ammos and just generally have a harder time they do however interact with the world around when you re not moving and they will have something to say or people will have something to say about them often enough to be entertaining i d want more as usual but it wasn t lacking their perks however are all over the place some of them gives amazing perks while others are just plain useless which doesn t help wanting to team up with them content wise it s all south you start the game up north and all the quests towns are densely packed at the bottom of the map my first impression of the game was where the hell are all the merchants which unless you want to be a smart mouth and claim that there are plenty of merchants elsewhere the main merchants are down south those other merchants are traveling merchants which means they re not always there for you and can be killed by wildlife raiders explosions you or smaller merchants which means they won t have much to sell you anyway if like me you decided you want to explore the world before doing the main quest which is located in the biggest city in the game and avoided to go too far south because a i didn t want to do the main quest right away b i had other to do like the million things the minutemen asks you to doc the loading screen explicitely tells you the further south you go the more dangerous it becomesthen you most likely felt the way i felt the hunger for any type of community politics town with interesting stuff to do and hear about you roamed the wasteland doing missions like go there and kill that go help that settlement go kill the stuff that harrass the settlement in fallout new vegas your started in a town goodsprings with interesting people to meet and when you were done with them a little bit further down the road you had the powder gangers and other communities it had memorable people memorable places things you don t forget easily because they re interesting and not straightlined all those things despite still not being that much memorable or interesting are all south that s where things gets more fun people to meet things to do and see that doesn t end with putting a bullet into someone s head although it does happen and in a somewhat enjoyable fashion to not spoil anything the pace of the content isn t great at all i ve already mentionned everything being south but there s more to it i made a 5 intellect character int influences xp gain so i m mathematically assuming that my character is intellectually average i ended up getting my gun nut lvl 4 perk about a few hours away from beating the game finished the game lvl 41 that perk is required for silencers for high end ballistic weaponry which was the entire point of my character the perk lvl 3 wasn t much easier to get i spent most of the game playing with unsilenced weapons because the game just wouldn t let me craft it unless i m high level enough to get that perk which by the time i got it i had already done half the game i know this is something every game does but can we just stop that can we stop locking everything up until x level it s spoiling the fun for balancing purposes it s not an online rpg or fps since now they all have rpg elements it doesn t matter if i get that damn perk so fast i can blast people in one shot because guess what i m already blasting people in one shot on the hardest difficulty i just want to have fun while doing it i rped my character as a retired commando a stealthy lethal mofo you wouldn t want to mess with but spent most of my time shooting my way in because my level didn t allow me to have good enough stealth yet and because i wasn t high level enough to put silencers on the guns i get at my level forcing me to spend perks in charisma and other stuff until the perks i wanted got unlocked when i don t have a blackface or a whiteface or grey nights the graphics are actually pretty good and very immersive i love the clothing aspect of the game and the character creation isn t all bad i especially liked the opacity slider although not having sliders or numerical pointers for most things makes the creation a bit too clumsy and un repeatable it also isn t an efficient way of displaying the set of tools that you have you re left to a point and click minigame to figure out what does what and what cannot be changed i m not sure if i m giving this game a thumb down because of what it could have been or if it s because the current game as a whole is not great overall it just feels like a pipelined game it feels hollow it has no soul no passion the intro is where it s all at whoever was in charge of the intro and the first hour of the game did a great job that was amazing it s arguable that there should have been more pre war to give the player some time to actually care about the characters and get into the pre war mood but i was and still is thrilled to start a new game just not what is after that it s not a terrible game it was quite enjoyable at moments wish there was a meh button instead of a thumb down i still have a lot more to say about this game without even going into the bugs storyline spoilers aspect but fortunately i ve reached the maximum length for a review
