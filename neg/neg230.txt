2020 it s a fine mmo with a great class system and story choice mechanic however the company behind the game is atrocious truly the worst most incompetent simpleton people i have ever dealt with i have never gotten so mad at a company cs reps before essentially they have stolen from me twice i wouldn t imagine on purpose but it doesn t matter their resistance to fixing it despite my consistency as a customer is a level of abhorrent i have never experienced with any company before without going in to detail they did not give me something i paid for on two occasions the first time i spend tons of time gathering screenshots and writing emails once i had gone over the screenshots to be sure they fit the guidelines i sent them after sending them i was ignored for days until i recieved the same preprogrammed response asking for screenshots the fourth time this happened i had the rep say something was wrong with the shots but refused to tell me what i gave up and wrote a few bad reviews btw steam had records of the payment that directly contradicted their ledger one look at my screenshots of both dated ledgers would instantly make it obvious that i was screwed but that s apparently too much for them it s kind of them to hire solely the applicants who score get help on any iteration of the iq test but it makes for an impossible to deal with amalgam of the worst humanity has to offer bioware is truly beyond repair and although i have enjoyed ripping into them for this on any forum review i can i am saddended to think what swtor could be if it were run by a single functional person the second issue occured tonight i regrettably got a small purchase of coins again and tried to buy two of something i saw a loading ball for lack of a better term that i d never seen before now i am short the currency for two of these items and yet i have only one a person with at least half a functional brain could see the strange new loading ball ledger discrepancy what i have spent as a customer in the past and the missing item and see oh yea of course it is us i dont think this person is trying to scam us for 1 50 or the 10 from before they clearly have plenty of money and enjoy the game let us fix this for a good customer clearly the strange loading ball and missing item are a result of our error unfortunately this type of person is not a resource the swtor staff have access to not very much money to be fair but the time i have spent dealing with this and my consistency as a customer should warrant some benefit of the doubt on principle i am going to get what i paid for pack or i am going to continue to cost them more than it s worth in time i have and will constantly make new meandering tickets full of non sequitors i will make sure they make just enough sense so that it takes time to discern that they re nonsense i will call customer service from the many phone numbers i have access to whenever i remember that i am mad at them or bored and take as long as humanly possible i will continually email the 5 cs emails they provided me from my many emails same as the tickets i will constantly badmouth the company in game post the screenshots on forums amidst the bad reviews and explanations of what happened this is all between when i m doing other stuff but itll happen plenty i will happily cost myself more time and effort to cost them on principle i have never seen a company act so brazenly incompetent moronic and blaise i have told several friends acquaintances not to play oooor they can fix my issues costing them about 12 bucks and will allow me to continue subscribing supporting them the game is good a nice mmo it could be great if a functional company or single employee were at the wheel so sad
