2013 broken game broken company full of bull and finally my heart is broken been with this fanchise from the beginning and i sadly don t know if i ll ever buy a ca game from this point on sad very sad could have been a great game but is just flat and tedious edit now they have the balls to set a date for the first major dlc so soon when the core is still so broken at the very basic level not even talking optimization here really shocking i wouldn t even gift this to my worst enemies i just am in shock edit 2 beasts of war really just one face palm after another don t waste your cash edit 3 while i still do not agree with the buisness practices of ca i would like to amend my review a bit after many patches and with extensive mods this game is much better if i could give it a side ways thumb i would disapointed it took so long to fix 7 5 10dei and radious are the only reason to play this half game
