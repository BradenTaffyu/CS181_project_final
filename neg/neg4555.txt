2016 i have been playing civ since i was in 7th grade when i played the original game and colonization all the time i have spent about 2 000 hours total playing civ 5 i enjoyed beyond earth and starships for a bit not as good as regular civ but still fun i pre ordered civ 6 and vocally defended it at this point i believe i am going to give up on the game and go back to playing civ 5 though not very much because honestly i am mostly burnt out i probably won t buy the next firaxis game that comes out my reason is that i believe that this game is broken at its core i don t believe mods or expansions will fix what is wrong with it i feel that this is a trend that has been going on in the gaming industry and i am feeling saddened by it let me start off by saying i love the aesthetics of the game i think the art style is brilliant the animations are great and i just generally love how it looks and feels i had one game that i won through a culture victory and generally enjoyed it what i really don t like is the task list based game play each game is basically the same you are given a list of tasks to do and you need to do these or else suffer this is primarily from the eureka inspiration stuff and from the way the ai works now the ai is based on these arbitrary things that they love you or hate you for rather than the more organic feeling from previous games in the past ai generally hated you if you were expanding too fast if you were competing with their city states if you broke your promises etc now they hate you really fast for silly things i think it was a great idea as a concept but i don t believe it was executed well in civ 5 it was better with the ideologies it was great how game long friends suddenly become enemies because they are autocrats while i am using order etc i am not enjoying warfare in this game it s just about spamming units and i don t like the way the promotion system works at first i liked districts but now i despise them they look beautiful and really enhance the visuals but i just don t like the way they work this game is now all about micro decisions to maximize benefit rather than the organic fun that previous games were there are small things that i think expansions could fix such as the lack of information i am having a hard time figuring out religious pressure culture border growth barbarian expansion etc i can t find a unit list to figure out where all my units are and to find idle ones so far i have 1 completed game and about 10 abandoned games because they just weren t fun for me i am still glad that i pre ordered and if i had to go back in time i would do so again i get a bit teary eyed thinking about this since for the last almost 25 years civ has been my absolute favorite game franchise and a big part of my entertainment life and i am feeling that perhaps the magic is gone it may be gone for good
