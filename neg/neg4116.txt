2018 i would like to know why the cut off is 1 5 13 to be eligible to get the making history expansion for free i bought the game 13 5 13 and have been an active user ever since its not really fair to have missed out by less than two weeks almost 5 years ago when i bought it early access on steam which promised me any and all future additions to the game i would ve hoped my brand loyalty would mean enough to reward me every other game addon ever in every other steam game ive gotten in early access would reward all early access purchasers i have clocked nearly 400 hours in this game all of it was with no mods i fly manual and always have done so but if they re just going to alienate loyal users then i can t recommend this game to anyone who knows what they ll do next updatei emailed support and received this hi andy you can see the reasoning for the free dlc here as you can see it was less of a reward for early adopters and more of a clarification a oh so many of you thought we meant x well we didn t but since you thought that we ll go with it up to this point it was never part of our plan originally having made the clarification and set a date we re unable to start making exceptions for this as more and more people would start asking for less and less reasonable exceptions i ve already had a user ask for an exception because he bought the game only a year after the deadline i understand you re probably frustrated but we think the expansion is reasonably priced and i m sure that if you do buy it you will too all the best xxxx name removed ksp supportwhen i clicked on the provided link here s a snap above all is the admittedly quite grey area concerning what constitutes an update or an expansion to ksp and most importantly what our promise of all future updates for free actually means we realize there is more than one way to interpret that regardless of whether updates implies expansions or not it s quite obvious now that we need to rephrase that statement so everyone knows exactly what they re getting when they purchase the game this is an admission of guilt that they were misleading by consumer law this entitles anyone who feels misled the right to a full refund if ksp take two don t either give me the expansion for free or offer a full refund for the game i will be contacting the consumer protection agency the better business bureau and the federal trade commission for further action if i am successful i will make it very well known so that everyone else in my position can use my case as a precedent and do the same i will also consider starting a class action if there s enough interest if it was indeed considered by them a paid expansion outside of the agreement of the original program then why give it free to those who bought it before may 1st 2013 they should have either made everyone pay or offer it to all early access members who bought the game before official release in 2015 this is highly fraudulent behaviour and its clear that take two are trying to make their aquisition of the product as profitable as possible while hoping people wouldn t realise how illegal it is
