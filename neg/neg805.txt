2016 having played 86 hours of this game explored countless locations killed endless raiders and looted endless piles of objects i can safely say this is not a fallout game what exactly does that mean it means that almost everything that made fallout what it is is stripped out the skill system has been stipped away and replaced with an utterly dull perk tree remember how excited you were when you levelled up in the previous games well forget about that because it is not a pointless process done only if you feel like crafting or lockpicking gone are the days of having to plan your character and roleplay as a specific type of individual instead the addition of endless levels and being able to upgrade your s p e c i a l skills with level points means you will be a jack of all trades and a master of them all this is great news for casuals who bethesda clearly targeted but awful news for anyone looking for a deep role playing experience and replayability the story is dull and awfuly slow not going to spoil anything but its just meh you can only be one character the concerned maybe sarcastic dad want to be evil well you cannot be maybe a bit naughty but if you are looking to be that devil you were in fallout 1 2 3 and new vegas you will find it utterly impossible here the dialogue is widely complained about so i won t go into much detail all i will say is that its either yes yes no yes or a sarcastic yes no options no variety no roleplaying no depth the art style is way too cartoony i have no issue with the below par graphics but the art style just dragged me out the game completely i m not saying it had to be as grim as fo3 but something more realistic like new vegas would be good looting is terrible and this destroys the drive to explore exploring is of course the basis of a fallout game so when the most interesting thing you find it a bottle of wonderglue you have a problem the weapon variety was stripped back to allow for crafting which is great and all but now you no longer find great weapons because all you have to do is craft them armor is ugly and making power armor a vehicle is a poor gimmick in my opinion the only way anyone can find looting exciting is if they are obsessed with the underwhelming crafting element speaking about crafting thats another underwhelming element not only is it very clunky very difficult to get walls to click properly or align fences but also completely useless sure its cool to have a badass base but what exactly does it do no one else can see it and nothing ever attacks it meaningfully so whats the point this element has been done better in countless games it feels like bethesda just threw it in because its a treding thing the locations and characters are dull no life to them no cool secrets hiding about in them except one or two spots vaults are awful and considering they were a highlight of previous games this is unforgivable quests are mostly repetitive fetch quests you may at first be overwhelmed by their quantity until you realize 95 of them are go there kill that repeat companions are just as stupid as previous games and more dull on the plus side the game did not have as many bugs in my experience as previous games the weapon modding is cool and the robot modding added by automatron is nice shooting is also a lot better than previous games and v a t s is no longer neccesary however thats where the big problem comes in you can see that shooting was bethesdas total focus they built a shooter with rpg elements that for me is just disgusting to take a deep ongoing series of rpg s and make it into a shooter series more akin to rage that fallout is disgraceful thats not mentioning the abysmal handling of dlc where bethesda nearly doubled the cost of the season pass when it decided it could milk more from us all in all a decent shooter but an awful fallout game as a shooter 7 10as a fallout game 5 10
