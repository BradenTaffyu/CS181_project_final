2022 i cannot recommend this game to the general audience not even for people interested in building and colony sim type of games like rimworld or factorio if however you are a fan of engineering games like kerbal or shenzhen i o and on top of that enjoy the additional survival pressure then this game might be for you i have spent a lot of hours on oni many out of which are due to spite most of my friends who owned this game didn t bother after a couple hours and i can see a few major reasons first of all this game punishes you for not being ready before the problems even appears heat water food breathability all can end your colony before you realize you have to deal with them and if you survive you might be left with a mess that you are probably better off just leave behind and start a new colony this is especially rough for new players since the cost of their mistakes is usually a lot of hours and not many of them have the leisure to start over even there might be interesting content down the line that they would enjoy and not even the no sweat mode can rescue you when the vent you unknownly dug out heat your entire base to 70c or when the crude oil touched magma and flashed into sour gas and fill your entire base the second issue is the convoluted mechanics the devs meticulously added heat properties density radiation absorption rate etc for each material making me think the correct approach when engineering a solution is through realism but then when the physics is implemented it just doesn t make sense liquid locks are unaffected by atmospheric pressure solid blocks take damage from liquid pressure but not from gas heat can be destroyed by the power it generated etc etc and lastly i think the most demoralizing aspect of the game is balancing through research you can unlock machinery like gas filters heavy duty wires metal refineries airlocks and fridges some of these are quite accessible at the earlier stages of the game and guess what if you watch an experienced player like francis johns you will notice that they simply don t touch these tools when they are first acquired gas filters use too much power metal refinery generates too much heat airlocks don t work well at all just use liquid locks and fridge could just be replaced by ration box submerged in co2 there are so many exploits that work infinitely better that also avoid the downsides of the tools the game offers you and combined with the aforementioned bizarre implementations there sprung a multitude of wacky hacky builds that became the go to solutions to the aforementioned survival mechanics spom starvation ranch water lock petroleum boiler etc etc so if you are into figuring out the very particular implementations devs use and craft builds to exploit them to your advantage you might very well have found the perfect game for you for anyone else this is a warning for the frustration ahead
