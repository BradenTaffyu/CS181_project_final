2018 i used to enjoy this game its relaxing teaches you patience and can just be good fun that is until after 135 hours in it decided to crash and wipe out all progress i put in another 10 hours to get to a point where i could start getting decent equipment again another crash and loss of all progress after searching on the forum i found a post showing that the devs have known about this issue since march 2017 and it s still not fixed unfortiunately it s kicked me for a second time and i really have no interest in grinding again to get to the decent equipment a great shame as as its best its a cracking game just a shame the devs don t care about fixing major flaws
