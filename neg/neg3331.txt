2016 the game uses a world tension mechanic that i find extremely boring frustrating and that i believe was most likely an attempt at avoiding the challenge of programming a real ai that could actually respond in the national interests of each nation instead of countries doing what would benefit them once world tension reaches a certain point they will guarantee the independence of any nation no matter how small and insignificant no matter it s lack of strategic significance to the guaranteeing country resulting in endless wars that make no strategic sense for example the only difference between whether or not brittan declares war on germany when germany makes a move on poland is whether or not world tension is above or below 25 also the battle plan system is absolute it looks like a good system at first glance but when i started watching my units more closely in large offensives they were doing some really strange things they would stall out stopping their advance well before reaching their objectives even when the enemy they were facing was inferior i often found units moving from one end of my front line to the other for no apparent reason it was not at all unusual to see infantry units swapping places along extend fronts infantry at the extreme north end of an offensive line would suddenly move to the south while infantry of the same type would move from the south to the north it made no sense a lot of the problems aren t apparent until you re well into the game i didn t really understand how up the world tension mechanic was until i was trying my forth play through and started looking at online discussions to try and understand why the ai was doing such stupid things i didn t notice the problem with battle plans until my last play though i grabbed a couple of mods that nerf the world tension mechanic but when i went to start another game i found myself exiting out as soon as it started i just couldn t bear to play another moment and to be honest i can t really say i enjoyed any of my time with the game the thing is it take so long to figure out what is going on that by the time you realize how up it is you are way past the 2 hour refund period edit fixed spelling
