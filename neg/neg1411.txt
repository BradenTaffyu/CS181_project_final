2022 i am not a review guy but i had to leave one for this game i love mount and blade around 600 hours on warband and i couldn t miss out on this game either but god honest truth the first 20 hours in campaign are cool after you own a fief it all comes crashing down the enemy has infinite lords who can rebuild a 1k army in 1 2 days and come at you where you can defeat all of them with the best troops in the game but there is no penalty for them losing 1000 troops i even had 100 lords captured from one fraction and still there were like 50 more running around it becomes so stagnant and boring to fight all of the battles where there is no end in sight without mods this game is really boring
