2019 i finally hit the wall at tier 8 ships after a few hundred hours without paying for credits the credit service cost on the ships becomes so high you have to buy premium plus play excellent all the time or the post service costs bankrupt you and you have to sell off your earned ships to keep the gamble alive i paid a little on the up for xp which is the first catch and i am not paying on the other end to buy credits to keep the russian casino afloat im insulted and you got your last penny out of me
