2023 edit game is better but some aspects some ui and qol could really be added are similar to my previous review so i ll be leaving it as is below there s more options and some things about defense dice are a bit better but other things could be better you have your typical gacha powercreep as usual and more stuff that are kinda questionable game balance but considering there s good amount of viable options for how to play it s not the worstpm gives a lot of resources for free out so as far as gachas go it s not that bad ishmael is still cuteold review below a lobotomized version of ruina s combat complete with extra rng and 50 more mechanics that are horrifically overwhelming with a worse ui things like what color is this sin supposed to be that had an easy fix such as coloring the text with the sin s respective color aren t done at all on the later fights where the enemies feel like they re always rolling 13 haha k corp time there s no way to exploit or force one sided attacks meaning you just get slaughtered because all you can do is clash or tell your nuggets to stand there and take it mobile ui makes figuring out anything extra difficult such as what skill set is this id because in things like mirror dungeons you can t long press and figure out what loadouts you want to go with until you select your sinners locking you in other aspects of gameplay feel poorly thought out for instance counter defense coins counter coins are worthless in return for taking one hit you get to attack back without having to clash essentially making it 2 one side attacks great if you can trade except in situations where you cannot trade you have no other options but to go for a clash or hope that rng means another skill will interrupt bad attacks ruina is already kinda just game about gambling but you have ways to mitigate the random this game is just a gambling game with the gameplay loop being more gambling a simplified ruina would have been fine making it fast and sweet but instead this game feels like a slog to do anything ishmael is cute
