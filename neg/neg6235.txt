2023 played the alpha played the beta loved the game however the devs practices have completely turned me off from this game even those that bought the 300 dollar practice dont have access to the season pass which is a joke and then the whole practice of only selling preorders on their website so that people couldnt refund their game is just sad owlcat has gotten greedy and instead of wanting to tell a story they only care about profit on that note im out and i hope people strong consider if they wish to support these devs but more than that i hope that the devs take a good hard look at themselves and see theyre destroying the good will and community they built up over the last couple years even months ago they said on reddit that their plans for dlc was going to be the same as the way they handled dlc for wotr so i call on their excuses theyve made on other negitive reviews addressing this issue ill gladly come back to the game and change my review once owlcat addresses their internal issues they made a good game but a good game doesnt excuse bad behavior and abuse of their community
