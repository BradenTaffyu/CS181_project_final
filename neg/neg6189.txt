2023 edit 2 many many patches and six months later every fix spawns a new bug game can be properly finished now but so many aspects of the game are still broken so much time is spent leveling up my characters only to find out that their abilities often don t work time is spent to get rep and profit factor for traders often to find that items don t work so many talents are a waste of time since they re russian dolls of basically nested if then statements that will take several turns to set up but why bother when cassia and or argenta can just nuke the battlefield before the enemies get a turn it s ironic but the combat and leveling system that are the heart and core of this game are by far the worst buggiest and most tedious part of the game and the space combat which is almost an after thought is simple elegant and most of all fun i m sorry owlcat but i just can t recommend rogue trader at anything lower than a 75 or greater discount edit 1 one patch two hotfixes still borked like previous owlcat releases the story and writing is quite engaging and they ve really nailed the rogue trader vibe but it is the usual owlcat release buggy as hell overly complex rules for no reason other than to add arbitrary layers of complexity never ending filler combat and about as polished as a rusted soviet car i might change my recommendation later but now at release wait until it s either severely discounted and or has been thoroughly patched
