this game is fun and more than expected i thoroughly enjoyed this game but i can t in good conscience recommend that someone pay for this game they ve turned a good product into a dlc factory and those of us who care about achievements get shafted they might as well be ea games with the micro transactions cause that s literally the next step don t pay money for this
