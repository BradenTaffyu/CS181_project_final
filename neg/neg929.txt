2016 this is my opinion about about fallout 4 and the dlc s pros bigger scales graphics are nice weapon mods act better as a fps running easier to acces favorited weapons or items you can quit to desktop without going into the menu music is good in my opinion neutral beacuse i don t consider them bad or good voiced character follwers liking or disliking you actions functions kinda like karma animated pip boy animated perks settlements the radio isn t really god vats is now in slow motion cons acts worse as a rpg who tought removing the karma system was a good idea enemys become bullet sponges around level 50 to 60 no more tag skills there are still some that resemble the one in the tag skills the season pass is just a rip off right now the only dlc worthwhile is far harbour i have fps problems in some areas maybe is my pc but why do i get those problems only in those areas depends a lot on modding to fix bugs and glitches that bethesda didn t fix themselves the dialogue system is just horrible when compared to the other fallout games when you pick a dialogue option you don t know what your character is going to say you just get a bland yes or no or maybe sarcastic and a question or maybe it just doesn t work the charisma checks or the yellow orange red options work differently beacuse of the tag skills being removed the settlement system is almost useless for most people and most of the dlc s realeased by now are settlement based if you dont have enough perception you will miss every shot with vats in the end i would recommend fallout 4 is you like fps but if you like rpg s stay away from this game it just sucks at the rpg department also do not buy the dlc season pass is just a rip off for things that mods for the game already do and some of the things that are original are not even worth it far harbour is the only dlc that is worth your money maybe automatron but that s it the workshop dlc s are only for the people who like settlement building which most people who bought the game didn t use the settlement system most of what this dlc s do can be already done with mods
