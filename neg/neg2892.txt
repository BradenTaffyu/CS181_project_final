2019 tl dr stellaris used to be a great game but has turned unintuitive and very unfun in recent updates 9 10 before update 2 1 4 10 after update 2 1 stellaris was a great strategy game until they made it overly complex micro management based and incredibly un intuitive when i say un intuitive i m not complaining from a i don t understand the mechanics standpoint i m talking from a even the game s ai doesn t understand the mechanics standpoint whereas it used to be a decently immersive well thought out strategy game it feels more akin to a mobile game nowadays with ridiculous amounts of micro management and a slough of resources tied to an economy so fragile that only you the player are bound to it if the game s computer controlled empires were required to put in half the insight or strategy you are required to to keep your empire running smoothly paradox interactive would have accidentally created skynet but more on that later in the review in previous iterations of stellaris you managed a select few resources energy minerals food and population these were quite fun to manage allotting entire worlds to massive mining complexes or energy plants was beneficial simple and kept the game running smoothly alternatively you could run less risk of losing a massive chunk of resources should a planet fall by building whatever the planet s surface tiles dictated farms on rich land mines on mineral laced areas and so on occasionally you would find strategic resources finding these and harvesting them granted permanent bonuses to your empire as long as you controlled the resource additionally once your empire expanded to an appropriately galactic scale you could allot star systems to sectors lead and autonimously run by governors as long as a planet is well governed the locals are happy this allows for efficient expansion through the galaxy and intuitive trades with other empires as you become a notable force on the star map dlc s added a massive amount of variety in your empires playstyle adding content like ship designs government types empire backgrounds races and traits and so on in the current iteration of stellaris brought about with update 2 1 the megacorp dlc you have upwards of a dozen resources to worry about in an ever so fragile pyramid scheme a is required to make b b and c are required to make d a through d are required to make e and f etc etc additionally modification of a population s current employment the information on which can be found on the bland new planet chart as opposed to the previously colorful planet map with a variety of land tiles results in widespread unemployment poverty and unhappiness on the planet as a result production lowers and even more unhappiness arises this chain of resources and population maintenance is so convoluted that a quick peek into any ai empire will reveal they actually have no idea how to manage it the resource and production numbers you see from your empire s perspective while observing others are arbitrarily allotted regardless of what the empire is actually capable of producing this leads to very frustrating wars where it really makes no sense how another empire is withstanding yours even after sustaining critical loss of territory and speaking of seizing territory your economy comes to a grinding halt whenever you gain another empire s planet thanks to the painfully bad ai economy often times a planet will be covered entirely in a single type of building or some other incredibly inefficient design that keeps production almost impossibly low in addition to keeping the locals unhappy and unemployed which has ridiculously expensive repercussions across your empire the bottom line is strategy games are frustrating when not only are you required to worry about a million little things at any given time but your methods for managing the aforementioned million things is very poorly designed and inefficient to top it all off you are the only person worrying about these things the ai empires get to blissfully free float in an economy magically materializing to fulfill their every wish it feels very one sided rushed and poorly thought out i d give stellaris 4 10 in it s current iteration and a 8 5 9 10 in previous ones
