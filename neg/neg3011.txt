2018 1 9 was likely the best iteration of this game war may have been a bit janky but at least it didnt take a rediculous amount of time and copious micro management to reach a system a few jumps away personally i feel paradox have removed what was fun about this game somewhat quick pacing for ship movement and an interesting system of controlling space through the use of colonisation and frontier outposts paradox have apparantly decided this game should become a multiplayer experience forcing those of us who only play single player myself included to have to use mechanics that limit warfare and colonoizition why would i want to spend rediculous amounts of influence on creating claims to declare war on someone only to be run into the ground by war exhaustion i ll probably revert to 1 9 edit 2020 yeah its aight
