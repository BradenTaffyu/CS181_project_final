2020 so i ve spent quite a few hours in here and manage to talk in public chat for the first time i d like to start by saying i have a clean steam record for the 17 years i ve had it and i ve never been banned from any of the 400 games that i have on my account someone other than i made a political statement in public chat i commented on it which apparently sent right after a mod said to keep political statements out of the game and instead of a warning i got perma banned from public chat because they assumed i was going against what the mod said did anyone else probably not this game has terrible moderation no warnings they go right for the throat they don t want to deal with people civilly so they decide to ban whoever they feel is fit to ban at the time and ya go ahead and tell me oh well that s what you get for bringing politics in a game zinoxic no i wasn t the one who made a statement to start try warning kicking the guy who made the statement in the first place you go for the source of the issue the mod s seem like children who are licking their lips and excited to click the ban button on people and it s ridiculous you have a public chat you re lucky enough for this game to be funded by people like me yes i actually kickstarted your game a long time back you re welcome and now you make it so i can t find anybody to play board games with all because i take the time to make a political comment on someone else s statement which wasn t even bad mind you why don t you developers watch who you make mod and try giving a temporary 1 hour ban to start instead of getting so trigger happy maybe it was a staff member who had a bad day maybe work your way up to harsh punishment instead they throw the ban hammer right out the bat who wants to buy continue playing a game that bans you from their chat community that is supposed to help you find people to play board games with and for what making a political comment not me sad part is i didn t even curse and still got a ban unheard of try banning all of the trolls that infest your chat instead of targeting innocent people buy tabletop playground instead
