2023 early access review tl dr recent update s ruined the game which is 10 years old and still buggy unfinished and developers have disabled comments on their posts to silence criticism there are better games out there now i really want to still recommend this game as the exploration element was strong and one of the most immersive games i have played but unfortunately recent changes have negatively impacted those elements and made things more linear the developers have also gone on the route of outright disabling comments an their posts and locking the old ones which tells me things are going downhill quickly if anyone is actually reading this review than i would suggest avoiding this game now as it s been 10 years since this game released and it is still in an unfinished state and honestly i don t think this game is going to ever get finished and will probably go belly up in the next few years
