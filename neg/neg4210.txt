2013 arma iii is a good game with a good concept of what it is trying to do they have started to roll out the campaign finally after a few months after realese what helped arma ii was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game as this seems to be the direction that arma iii is going and that for one thing is excellent this could spur some very interesting gameplay and i am hoping it would catch on with groups such as shactac or lsg just like in arma ii graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game now for the downfall not everyone has this but many people do the game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise cpu and gpu properly these two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful playing the game at 10 25 fps is not possible you are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance the bis developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining this feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers when it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly a similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is too hard and we are not willing source really i do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them they are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising finallypros excellent multi roll military simbeautiful graphics imoway smoother than arma ii ex shooting aimingaltis and stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplayimproved physics with bullets and vehiclesthe ragdolls cons severe performance issues and utilisationthe sound assets could be better that is nothing mods cannot sort game feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles weaponsthe campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incompletethanks for reading editso i upgraded my pc and have been playing a ton of arma recently the sad thing is though my fps never stays above 60fps and i still sometimes even drop below 30fps with such a good pc it is really really depressing that this game is so awfully optimised when i jumping in the editor and get 60 fps i see what the game could be they have also now finished the campaign and on the plus side jsrs studios are developing a new version of jsrs that is going to be a must have mod in arma iii for me i am still going to leave this unrecommended on the fact that it does not even seem to have changed despite spending alot of money on a new pc and even buying a watercooler for the cpu so i could overclock it just to find out that i still get bad fps i am playing the game yes i am also enjoying the game but underlying all of that is still disappointment i guess if you like arma ii and you think your pc would be up to it go for it otherwise don t bother again thanks for reading
