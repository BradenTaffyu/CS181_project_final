2017 there are lots of choices in this game currently i m roleplaying as a veteran who was married to a lawyer both had a child but the child got kidnapped and his wife got killed while in the vault i think next playthrough i will be a lawyer who was married to a veteran and both had a child but the child got kidnapped and her husband got killed while in the vault a bit radical i know but that s the kind of freedom you have in this game the dialogue system is a blast i don t like reading or making difficult choices so they reduced the number of responses to 4 don t worry though if that number was too big for you just remember that 2 3 of them result in the same output wow how immersive like arbitrary crafting systems and picking up random junk off the ground because that s a fun thing to do great this game has you covered make sure you fill your inventory with lots of junk because you ll want to craft that thing that the said junk may or may not help you with crafting for a game that is touted as a fully fledged rpg it couldn t be any further from the archetype this is a shooter with rpg elements and there are virtually no negative consequences for doing whatever the hell you want in the game there is no karma system there is no faction system aside from the s p e c i a l points there aren t any other character based stats this is probably the most dissappointing game i have ever played being an avid fan of fallout nv and a slightly less avid fan of fallout 3 tl dr bethesda keeps dumbing down their games for a more broad audience the game is shallow the story and characters are boring and very linear and there are very little choices to be made in this rpg note i wouldn t advise going to the comments section of this review it s a toxic mess full of assumptions and unsubstantiated claims that appearantly i didn t play the game long enough or rushed through it i spent 40 hours on 1 playthrough and i didn t even start the main questline until 20 hours into the game i don t like rushing through games i m very observant and i love to try everything i can before giving up on it i m not going to continue to play it if i don t like it i just didn t like the game simple as that cry all you want my opinions won t change to the people saying that there s a backstory in every falllout game and that makes my first argument invalid read this yes there is a backstory to each fallout game however the things revealed about your playable character differ greatly i play fallout games to make a new character with their own lore and backstory beacuse you know this is an rpg franchise built on that principle in fallout 4 many of these intrinsic variables are decided for you we know for a fact that your character is had a veteran in the war or a lawyer a middle class american is from the commonwealth in an affectionate heterosexual relationship presumably no criminal record had a male child because of the few dialogue choices and voice acting your character s temperament and emotional attitude are pretty linear and don t leave much to the imagination in comparison to a title like fallout 3 you lived in a vault your entire life yes i m aware you learn you were born outside the vault later on you are from the dc area you had a caring scientist father and a mother who died in childbirth and to fallout new vegas you were a courier at least at the time when the game starts you were delivering the platinum chip to new vegas see how little is made for you in those games especially in fallout nv where the only thing made up for you is your previous occupation any other variables ie your vault was compromised in 3 or benny tries to kill you in nv are purely extrinsic variables and do not affect how you make your character there are very few degrees of freedom in making your character in fallout 4 and many of the metrics like character stats karma and group affiliation numbers are completely taken out i bought this game at launch because this is what i was expecting but the game i got was different that is why this review is negative
