2021 well written mechanically obtuse and enthusiastically mean spirited divinity 2 has little respect for you your time or the quality of the story hidden somewhere inside it first the rogues gallery of rpg sins that i wish i knew about before playing badly sign posted points of no return overwhelming inventory clutter the ability to accidentally sell quest items you re always under geared and short of money unless you cheese the theft mechanics which is tedious and turns your heroes into kleptos irritating skill combination requirements your mc needs high persuasion for the story and high strength if you want to loot stuff quickly so now you have to put maxed bartering on a second trade character and move everything you want to sell from your max strength character to your trade character and even though your mc has higher attitude with the trader because of the story you have to give gifts with your trade character until the traders attitude with them is highest so you can buy and sell at the best price a crafting system that offers nothing useful until you re replaying it and already know all the recipes extreme power scaling means you either effectively win a fight in the first turn or get hard countered or sand bagged by mobs with various artificial difficulty asspulls the content looks sandboxy but it s actually gated behind the extreme power scaling there is very much an intended route and if you want to go off it then you ll have to cheese everything many many unwinnable or otherwise game ruining fights that will trigger with no warning whose only function seems to be to teach you to save scum i understand that this is supposed to make it charming old school or otherwise resemble a real dnd campaign but if this was a real dnd campaign i d stop being friends with the guy running it because he s wasting my time a lot of the game feels designed around these moments where the dm goes ahaha i got you and i sigh yet again gee divinity i guess you did and i reload my save sandbox rpg sure there s thousands of ways to build your character but there s only a handful that won t get you blinded knocked down teleported into cursed fire and turned into a chicken before you ve had your first turn the game is full of fake choices like this that ultimately force you to play within very strict boundaries every character is a wizard warrior necro rogue hybrid that can all do largely the same things because spiking through armour while having a bar full of cc summons ohshit buttons and heals is the one way you don t die that s fake complexity by this point the plot is all i m sticking around for and it s great i m totally invested i just wish i could spend more time following it and less time teleporting back and forth between my base cleaning my inventory and fiddling with stats the plot holds real interest dozens of hours in the voice acting is great the writing and character work is patchy stabby revenge lady sebille is japanese video game terrible grizzled mercenary with a heart of gold ifan is modern fantasy novel good and feels like my friend the worldbuilding likewise offers rather booky twisty grandiose stuff really excellent for a video game though the world itself is far too depressing and absurdly dependent on animal cruelty and sickly sweet pathos to achieve tragedy i return to the game with a kind of funereal sigh every time wondering if i m going to be babysitting a kitty through a bunch of guys with crossbows talking to a sad dog who misses his friend who i have to explain death to or a crying baby bear whose mamma won t wake up who i have to explain death to or a sad undead cat who misses her owner who i have to explain death to or a suicidal beached shark or a couple of kids looking for their friend who the shark ate or any one of hundreds of dead people inhabiting the world as spirits who i can see and who or one of the many many many times i was obliged to feed my elf a dead eviscerated person s hand or foot because in this world elves are magic cannibals who can absorb a person s last moments and which allows me to it s full of this pantomime of horrible things without actually achieving horror i think it s an attempt at mature themes or dark fantasy but it mostly comes off as just nasty the story is still there despite all the rubbish piled on top of it and it s been a lot of fun but it seems the developers cared more about it feeling mean than delivering it well
