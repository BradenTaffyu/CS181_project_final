2020 early access review love the game but the discord server for this game is a travesty the developers of this don t deserve support i got banned for offhandedly calling the six day stilt cathedral crap said something along the lines of great i gotta go back to this crap place a bunch of people got triggered and i got banned i had literally never broken the rules before that either also there are aspects of this game that are severely unpolished i once got trapped inside a forcefield bubble by some psychics couldn t attack them couldn t reload a save couldn t do anything at all there wasn t even a warning as far as i could tell because they just jumped me from offscreen so that was a nice softlock i could do nothing about not to mention there are lots of enemies that can one hit you or severely damage your run if you don t know what they do don t you just love trial and error time wasting so yeah decent game overall kinda jank though and hard to learn it s not really that hard to be honest more annoying than anything because of highly overpowered enemies that you won t know about until they ve ruined your run lots of trial and error as said which is bad for a game you re in the long haul for one mistake starting a several hour run all over again you need a lot of patience the developers and community for this game are the worst i can t overstate this enough don t try and reason with these unhinged people they ll just call you a crypto fascist and ban you as they did with sseth himself
