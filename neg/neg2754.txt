2018 as of todays update 2 22 2018 i cannot recommend this game anymore i will change this review if the game is fixed however in its current state the game is beyond broken it is a reskinned mix match of eu4 crusader kings and sins of a solar empire with a dash of identity crises that makes this combination a complete mess it s no longer a game where you can write your own story the story is now pre written for you and you have to comply with that template when you play the biggest issues with this latest update are the war system you can no longer take individual systems from empires if you want to play a determined exterminator you better be ready to create diplobots and fancy posters to announce to the galaxy that you want systems x y z even though you re supposed to be a driven exterminator uh oh that doesn t fit into your template anymore pun intended nomadic pirates the game now features pirates who are spaceborn and have a triggering event later that allows them to become basically an end game event except it triggers much sooner these factions come so early that you cannot stand up against them so be ready to restart if you re near one additionally because the ai knows exactly when their attack timer is reset good luck ever being able to hire these guys to attack an ai to be fair you can turn these off so it s not game breaking but it s definitely annoying and disappointing that it was put in with such pre alpha level testing war exhaustion there is a new system in place that is called war exhaustion meant to imitate the fatigue weighing on your people during a war since y know war costs a lot however this system is so laughably poorly designed that it will force you to surrender a winning war just because your people are fatigued this is so game breaking because the ai can simply declare war seize 6 8 systems and exhaust you by spamming peace talks or just taking what are essentially worthless outposts yet fatigue your entire empire this is part of the customization restriction because if you are a determined exterminator ai faction ie the borg your empire could litterally be cut in half because your peace loving borg are tired of fighting i must ve missed that episode overall this system literally will end any war no matter the circumstances in 5 years which is absolutely insane earth in it s history has had dozens of wars that lasted much longer over a much smaller distance so why are we surrendering in such a short timeframe absolutely game breakingly stupid fleet composition this is a gray area it is a small improvement but an overall game breaking change fleets never had a limit ending up with everyone creating a deathstack all your ships in one fleet that roflstomp everything to fix this there is a new convoluted pointless system now how it works you have an empire wide ship limit within that limit you can allot a certain amount of ships to each fleet this is intended to stop you from death stacking but it does not you can simply make the fleets travel together but now you have to monitor 2 levels of ship limits pop cap instead of just 1 additionally you now have to spend vital society research to increase these limits of which again there are now two so this is a double whammy therefore this is overall a negative a much simpler method would have been to restrict fleet size to the capability of the admiral which would scale naturally and take some skill as well as make admirals valuable scripted play style after this latest update it is virtually impossible to play this game the way you want if you deviate from the intended play style you will be punished by the ai in the form of a federation of ai that bear down on you with endless attacks using the broken war exhaustion system to seize your systems until you have nothing left with each update this game has become more difficult to amass resources or maintain a fleet and this is essentially the final straw the entire economic system of this game makes no sense anymore as the government you literally pay for everything and your citizens give you nothing in return except force you to surrender your empire because a few sensor outposts were attacked this game used to be about creating your own story and playing it out now you re given a story and punished with destruction and the realization of your wasted time if or when you don t abide overall if you are considering getting this game pay close attention to reviews on or after 2 22 2017 as this was the date of the most recent update that makes the older version unrecognizable i spent almost 400 hours playing this prior to the update and would have recommended this game to anyone that likes space style rts however in the current state it s extremely disappointing to see how little effort went into fixing the issues the game had and creating so many more maybe these will be fixed by future updates but my hope lies with the modding community
