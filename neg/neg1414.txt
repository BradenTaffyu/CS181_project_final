after being on the fence for a while with this one now i have decided to leave a negative review i ve been a mount and blade fan before warband addition back when you had the trial up to level 7 before they made you purchase the game i was one of those people that bought multiple serial keys of the original due to accidentally uninstalling and losing my licence key due to the old rubbish launcher i ve racked up over 1100 hours on warband on steam alone and countless more off steam i played the original and warband all through high school university and now banner lord in my late twenties although there has been some major improvements in banner lord like formation targeting graphical rework improved sieges and improved ai for me at least banner lord does not feel like a major step up from warband in its current state it feels like its only half complete yes the combat feels good yes the graphics are a big improvement and the ai is a step up but the replay ability and the depth is just not there the major issue i feel with banner lord is the lack of depth and extremely and i mean extremely repetitive mid and late game outside of hunting down lords and building up your army there isn t that much to do relations with other lords has no real impact in the game diplomacy is bare bones kingdom management doesn t feel fleshed out our meaningful it just feels incomplete it feels almost like an arcade battle simulator some major areas that need to be worked on are as follows tournaments meaningful lord relationships more events hunting courts intrigue diplomacy kingdom management fief development fief governorship i d love to feel some connection to my fiefs flesh out alternative play styles trading banditry smithing mercenary companies more involvement in enterprises better mid and late game these are just some suggestions from a long term fan
