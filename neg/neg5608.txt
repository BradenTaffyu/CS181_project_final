2014 i ve been a long time total war fan since the original rome back in 2003 i think this game was hyped up and i was keenly awaiting its release back in september thinking that this would be the best total war to date alas i was mistaken it s been 8 months into its release and is no where near being a finished product the politics is terriblethe ai doesn t work in siege or sea assault battles there is still a massive fps lag when units engage in combat the ai difficulty on campaign is done by handicapping the player and giving the ai bonuses rather than a more superior ai to fight against diplomacy is beyond dull and pointless have to play the game with mods to get any decent game time out of it then as soon as i hit a siege i get bored and quit as the ladders take 15 minutes to reach the walls and then the ai decides to throw flaming twigs at the gates i don t know what design decsions were made but it s safe to say that prmary school children 10 could have come up with better ideas i haven t purchased any of the dlc since there is no point what with critical gaming elements broken or missing and the fact that most of the dlc should be included in the game as standard this is the last total war game i shall ever get unless by some miracle the next one is outstanding you will also notice from any of the promotional videos that ca have never done a battle defending in a city against the ai since the ai is completely broken ca shipped an unfinished game which should have been advertised as early access alpha rather than a finished product in summary do not purchase this game unless you are just going to play multiplayer battles against real people
