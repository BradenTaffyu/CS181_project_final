2018 this is a fun game don t get me wrong but there are many many dlcs that are required to have fun and be remotely balanced with every dlc features are stripped from the based game and modified the modified features are locked behind a paywall through the dlcs if you bought this game when it first came out and played it now without dlcs you have much less of a game than you had originally it is much better to play a game that adds content for free or even that stays neutral than one that keeps making the base game less and less playable and balanced you either need to pay two hundred dollars of dlc or only play multiplayer with friends who have these dlcs and never play the game by yourself it is just not worth it
