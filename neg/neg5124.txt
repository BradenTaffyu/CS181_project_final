2016 its total war for people who don t like or are not super familiar with strategy games what you are going to hear over and over again is that this game is super flashy and it does some things great but always manages to simplify and reduce strategy and player options agency so if you have ever been daunted by a previous total war this is a great jumping in point but if you are looking for strategy or have liked previous total war games then you will be dissapointed as you will feel that this game is dumb silly and lacking in content also get it on a sale not worth 60 compared to other similar games single player campaign is fun but extremely simplified in terms of strategy there are no real bulding trees or religion mechanics or even diplomacy if we are being honest here agents heroes are amazing magic is great much of the changes made to the campaign map itself are fantastic and campaign map is actually dynamic and interesting props should be given to ca for their marketing team being honest and giving us real gameplay perhaps they learned from their lies and deceptive ways from rome ii dlc is already here to it all up of course but if you are even casually familair with the modern creative assembly you probably already know that is par for the course these days with total war game is beautiful wonderfully optimized and almost completely bug free but gameplay is the least strategic and tactical that we have gotten yet battles are short 5 10 minutes rush battles you don t even have time to proper flank or cycle charge or maneuver units and that is not a micro issue that is a simply the game ends too fast issue the silver lining to that is it makes the ai seem more intelligent since all it can do is rush and that is all a human can do these days as well multiplayer is a joke and broken as hell balancing is completely shot and there are no penalties or drawbacks to spams unlike in past total war games those are desperately needed there are very few options for multiplayer battles you cannot even set custom money amounts for individual sides or fight ffa basically multiplayer is bare bones or nonexistent and is worse than total war games from over a decade ago siege battles pah they are a joke sieges are a single wall not even a fort you surround just a single wall on a single side of a fort of which you cannot actually enter once the battle for the wall is over the game is over and every siege battle is and has to be a boring rush battle and you would think that with such a narrower focus they could make more variety in the sieges but nope every siege in every location for every faction is identical yes mods will probably be to the rescue but they are largely not here yet or still in infancy stages when they are i will update this update mods are gaining ground some great ones that i suggest you look up are 10 home region movement speed radious radious units radious blood better camera mod rebalanced heroes vastly fewer chain successes and any of the submods for radious that bring upkeep costs back down to the origional level while they are good they are not good enough there has been a single update so far which is pretty disgraceful support which did not balance anything and in fact only made multiplayer worse to play oh and they are calling basic game support updates free lc basically ca just insults their playerbase and tells them to off all the time then again blood pack dlc so i mean ca bending us over to give us a good reaming for daring to buy their product is not new update 2yeah so mods will never be able to rescue this game the only way to save it would be some large complicated costly complete overhaul mods which take years to make and only come from the increadibly devoted hardcore fanbase but this game deliberately on hardcore fans so its probably never gonna happen update 3so for a while my game had started to run more and more poorly i had blamed it on mods having gone back and re installed wiped a couple of times now i can say that the optimization which used to be great has been lost now i am lucky if i get 15 fps on a small scale battle when i used to get 40 on battles that were as large as they come not sure what the deal is here its the game s problem nothing is wrong on my end do not try if you just have a 970 apparently
