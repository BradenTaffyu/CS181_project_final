2016 as much as i hate to admit it fallout 4 is not a good game please note that the storysegment contains minor spoilers for the main story of fallout 4 world dont get me wrong its has a big exploreable world that has a lot to offer it feels bigger than the worlds of fallout 3 and fallout new vegas and theres lots of small stories to discover but they just arent fleshed out you find holotapes notes letters and entries on terminals but these stories are all already finished either because it was before the war or should establish some backstory to a place or to lead you to a reward but thats it there are sidequests offered by numerous people throughout the wasteland but they all are pretty much just about going somewhere and killing something with the personalities of the people that give you these quests feeling rather lackluster and unrelatable even if the reason for them giving you these quests in the first place may be understandable and relatable its hard to emtionally connect to the world and the people within because fallout 4 in simple words lacks one really important aspect soul interaction diamond city which is supposed the be the great green jewel of the commonwealth turns out to be essentially just a marketplace with the home of some compagnions nearby the residents walk around operate workbenches or sit somewhere with some food or a drink in front of them but thats it they dont react to you they dont resent you if you choose the arguably evil faction s and take actions that would bring the commonwealth under a dictatorship but they also dont appreciate you for helping the people of the commonwealth out in fact they dont recognize you at all theyre just there sadly this translates to all the npc s you meet everyone who isnt involved with the story or a sidequest just kind of exists in his own confined space this goes as far as the closest thing to an interaction between npc s that arent followers some followers will exchange lines with other followers or butt into conversations with one or two sentences to show their opinion being two raiders joking about their druguse when they loose you while sneaking or telling eachother a story if you listen long enough but thats it noone recognizes you except members of the faction you finished the main storyline with but even they just give you generic lines nor does the world go through a significant change through your actions which makes it feel like the whole game lacks depth the world is pretty to look at but it doesnt feel alive decisionmaking what plays into that is the disappearance of the karma system fallout 4 doesnt offer any real moral choices in a way you dont even get to play the bad guy anymore you can give sarcastic answers sure but thats about as evil as you can get theres no moral pathway to follow you cant become the shining hero of the wasteland that everyone likes neither become the villain everyone fears you cant get on the bad side of a faction just through your actions or on their good side by blending in through wearing their clothes which was a great feature in new vegas youre simply always the good guy who can choose to do the chores that npc s give you or not quests note that i say chores here then thats basically what the quests in fallout 4 are chores to aquire new places to build a settlement for example you either have to stumble across an empty settlement or wait until you are given a quest to make an existing settlement your ally which by the way always runs through 3 different variations of the quest those being kill the guys that gave us trouble save a kidnapped person or clear out a settlement space you havent discovered or cleared out yet the other quest almost all have that same principle as base go check something out and kill the entire population of that place seems to be the bottomline for most of these quests which becomes really repetitive especially considering how unimmersive the npc s are voiced which gives it a bland monotonous taste lore ontop of that at some points the game doesnt even make sense in its own lore for example at one point it exhibits that ghouls dont grow up if theyre ghoulified as children only to later have a school in which the all the kids that have been turned to ghouls have grown up to be adults this choice is made to prevent the player from killing children yet it takes away from the immersion by having inconsistencies in it owns lore another example of that would be the female protagonist being able to wear power armor despite not having any of the lorewise required training necesarry to do that story contains minor spoilers ontop of that the story of the game also falls short from the beginning on in fallout 4 youre playing just a normal person you lived before the war where the male protagonist is a veteran of the u s army and the male protagonist his wife a lwayer youre not a hardened wastelander the game acknowledges this by making your character questions the radroaches the first time he sees them and proceeds to then completly forget about this fact sure theres some dialog options that let you state youre from a vault but thats basically it the main character leaves the vault in pursuit of their infant son without much more griefance than taking the ring off their murdered spouse and swearing revenge and goes onto a killing spree without any hesitation whatsoever why because the game tells you to this person who knows nothing about the wasteland disposes of several human beings whose motives are unclear to him and he knows nothing about except that they look dangerous to rescue another group of human beings he knows nothing about while doing this quest the main character also displays the ability to use power armor which makes perfect sense considering the male protagonist was a soldier before the war in the case of the female protagonist this isnt the case yet she shoots rifles shotguns pistols and every other weapon in the game as if she had done nothing else all life long and moves in powerarmor as secure as in normal clothes of course i understand the design choice behind this but from a lore standpoint this simply doesnt make sense as every title before it required special training to move in the power armor ontop of that the maincharacter simply looses interest in their son after actually finding him reaction in some options completly cold toward the person that they spent the entirety of the story up to that point searching for which makes absolutely no sense the entire rest of the story from that point on revolves around who takes control of the commonwealth in the end with the family story almost entirely being shoved aside tl dr the game lacks the soul that made the other fallout games feel alive and decides to put shootergameplay over lore and story
