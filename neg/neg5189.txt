2017 tl dr i don t recommend at full price just get it when it s on sale and don t mind buying the dlcs unless you are really a fan of the warhammer franchise pros nice battles big monsters like giants or terrogheists make battles very intense and nice to look at siege battles got reduced to just a frontal assault of the sieged settlement which is nice in their previous games i e rome 2 you could attack settlements from all sides which was cool but most of the time you didn t even do that and attacked on just one or two sides every race is played differently i find the orcs to be the most amusing ones because they get armies through their waaargh when they fight raid a lot i like playing with an aggressive playstyle and therefore spamming orcish armies and just overrunning the enemy is awesome i really liked the customization of your heroes different skills spells and gear since they are an important part on the battlefield giving bonus to troops in the vicinity or maybe healing empowering them with spells cons i didn t like how the game proceeded so fast in like turn 50 70 the end game crisis chaos rises but even before that you will get to the highest tier units in no time most of the time i built one or two armies with low tier units and after a few rounds way before the endgame crisis you pretty much had endgame armies the gameplay gets pretty repetitive after you finished the main story line like defeat your nemesis faction and after that it becomes pretty much the same as every faction you build up your armies conquer settlements and that s it dlc policy as in previous games is horrible you pay to unlock blood you pay to unlock factions that are already in the game but you cannot use them this game gives you 4 playable different factions empire vampires dwarfs orcs and you have to unlock all the other factions like chaos which should be in the base game
