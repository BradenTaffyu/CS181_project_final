2019 i have purchased and played stellaris from its initial release along with all of its current iterations minus the megacorps dlc through several dozen games as various types of empires to experience the breadth of the playstyles along with the various chains of events although the game was not without its faults right from the 1 0 release paradox developers have made significant improvements over the life cycle both in gameplay and performance unfortunately the roll out of the le guin update 2 2 has introduced drastic changes to core game mechanics and more importantly game performance i understand that the overhaul will require time to fine tune both for players and for how the ai works within the new environment atm it does not the are unable to achieve a stable position at around mid game mark the biggest gripe significantly is an astronomical drop in game performance no matter the settings used the size of the map played upon or number of empires in play this has evidently been met with significant backlash by the community which paradox has responded in force with downright censorship of media platforms and adverse reporting for that in itself the game warrants a very negative review as for what is offered the first hundred years are quite enthralling with the age of exploration generally low levels of aggression and the various trigger events and anomalies this dies down to a general stalemate with your neighbours about 50 70 years in until the galaxy plunges into an age of war with the formation of various super entities and high aggression expansion the learning curve can be pretty steep with various things to micromanage as the defaults work in the same way as the ai and the game heavily punishes non optimisation this goes for as much the player s economy as for ship designs and population management unfortunately the game enters a state of extreme slow down around the 200 year mark due to the sheer volume of different calculations in play combined with ai decision making and end game crysis events even on a modern infrastructure
