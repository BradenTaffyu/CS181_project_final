2022 early access review more than 2 years after release and still an early access game tells you a lot fun was not had while playing this game lacks a lot of content in terms of map unit faction gameplay lore the definition of an unfinished product numerous visual and non visual bugs floating teeth and eyes in npc portraits game suddenly going back to the brightness adjustment screen when you quit you name it the user interface is rough and on top of all the ai is bad like troops running in circle in the highest difficulty combat realism while completly ignoring your troops bad like your faction declaring war on another faction you don t even share a border with bad like npc armies running around doing absolutely nothing and when actually do something they take castles settlements behind enemy lines bad oh and the loot system can be pretty unjust too defeated an entire bandit camp killed the final boss and his guards which had great looking gear loot given after nothing exciting which is odd when compared to warband you would get some sweet looking viking gear after taking down some sea raiders which you know makes sense it s the gear of the people you just killed it s not harvesting season
