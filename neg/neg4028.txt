2023 early access review got 2000 hours in the original ark so i really love the game but i just barely got 60 fps when everything is on low and dlss on i7 12700k and an overclocked 3070 ti in the remake no support for self hosted dedicated servers refunded maybe i ll will buy again when the game doesn t need a supercomputer and we re able to host our private games ourself
