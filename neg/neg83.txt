2021 early access review the early promises in development a full map with generated npcs and quests made to deliver emergent storytelling was pitched to consumers in 2011 with it appearing on steam early access in 2013 it s been 8 years of development and there are still central aspects of play missing for reference here was a roadmap post written in 2014 which made it sound like they were close to a 1 0 release including npcs and a storytelling system project zomboid announcement jun 23 2014 march to 1 0 hello everyone we ve had a rather wonderful weekend of steam saleage and are feeling in very high spirits we ve also concocted a plan for our advance to the ever elusive 1 0 and graduation from as of right now while a few random events exist in the game that spice up circumstances the game world feels empty every now and then you ll hear an ambient human like scream but there s actually no source to that scream currently there isn t even wildlife available for you to hunt just zombies the only way to fill the game world in this way is to play co op with a friend multiplayer servers supporting more than 2 players are coming soon the lack of storytelling really hits in mid late game after you have established a base and have enough supplies to keep yourself stable the motivation to continue into late game and beyond is entirely dependent on your ability to set your own goals as far as those go late game goals are incredibly grindy laborious the replay value is pretty good as it s fun to check out how different positive and negative traits really affect your gameplay style still due to the fact that the map is static you will find yourself exploring less and less with each new character and using your meta knowledge to make decisions about where to raid for supplies and which buildings to use as a base the workshop community is good and a handful of mods can change your experience with the game pretty thoroughly
