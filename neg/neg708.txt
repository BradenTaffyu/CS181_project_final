2018 i m a huge fan of open world games and i have played bethesda s games since i was a little girl oblivion skyrim fallout 3 nv and then came the time for fallout 4 i was so hyped to jump rihgt in and play the game experience the post apocalyptic world again but then after playing for a while i became super dissapointed so much that i couldn t bring myself to finish the game fallout 4 lets you explore a huge city which looks amazing the games looks very nice although they have been using the same ol engine for years the atmosphere is great especially in dark places you actually get chills down your spine the creatures and monsters look great compared to previous games deathclaws and ghouls especially in my opinion the new weapon building system is amazing and overall the combat is good and works smoothly even when you re not using v a t s you can combine tons of pieces and create your own unique gun from scraps that you collect in your journey but then 0 sense of rpg remember stumbling upon dying patients in fallout nv and realizing that if you have enough points in medicine you can actually save them how awesome was it to have 75 points in medicine just to save these guys when you have good karma and someone walks to you and hands you some bottlecups or unlocking special dialogue options with people just because you have a specific high skill these and many many more were the little things along the way in fallout 3 and nv that made you feel rewarded for investing in karma and skills and help you unlock special dialogues and options that otherwise you couldn t do they made you feel special and contributed alot to the sense of rpg in these games fallout 4 barely has these options and when it does it doesnt have the same impact as in fa3 or fa nv the dialogue wheel is one of the most pathetic things in this game and makes dialogues boring straightforward and almost always with the same outcome no matter which option you choose the dialogues in fa4 are voiced which in my opinion ruins the sense of rpg in this game but this is for you to decide the settlement building minigame was fun at the beginning but turned out to be a huge burden with each time it was attacked in a middle of a quest settlement is under attack wanted to explore this house settlement is under attack it s so unimportant and unnecessary to the game in my opinion especially with all the bugs it has i built an awesome bar with lots of bottles and stuff on the tables and shelves and when i returned everything was on the floor brahmins walking on roofs and things falling through furnitures it s not worth the time the quests i must point out that bethesda are great at making the open world in their games but story writing not their strongest quality and it can be seen during the game the game is filled with exhausting annoying repetitive quests especially faction quest these are the same quests all over again that take place in different places apart from a couple of good quests that i remember most of them were repetetive or just boring and what about the main quest well i couldn t bring myself to the end game as i mentioned because i got bored most of the companions are boring have no dept and suck when it comes to shoot things that s why dogmeat it ok because he doesn t have to shoot he s a dog their quest feel like anyother sidequest nothing special i didn t feel attached to any of them and the romance option cringe bomb i know i gave combat a but there s a thing that bothers me and it the v a t s system which hasn t been changed at all why not spice it up add something new there are many more things that just didn t make sense to me such as giving us power armor at the very beginning of the game oh and you don t just find it the power armor is given to you by a bunch of people who just met you and decide that you re ok enough to have it there are other stuff but i don t want to write anymore spoilers so there you have it to sum it up fa4 feels like an old bethesda game that had some major content removed and was left with less content then the games before it it s a good shooter yes but it s a bad fallout game
