2020 don t get me wrong the game has improved since launch and is worth picking up on sale it is fun to play up to a point once your junk starts limiting your stash you spend way too much time organising your inventory limiting how much fun you can have however bethesda has a solution the fallout 1st subscription the fact that they re selling unlimited junk the feature that would make everyone s time in the game more enjoyable forces me to give the game a bad review unless they give the scrapbox the everyone they should have better incentives rather than an essential feature
