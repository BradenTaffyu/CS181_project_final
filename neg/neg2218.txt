2023 what we need from gaijin the immense amount of vehicles you have to grind trough be put into folders for example all mig3 s under one folder etc so we dont have to unlock basically the same vehicle and the grind is more efficient and rewarding and also we need either less vehicles unlocked to advance a tier or some sort of research point nerf on a very good match i get 7 12 kills and still walk away with 1500rp when i got vehicles that need 26 000 or more
