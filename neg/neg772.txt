2020 if you re an fps player looking to play a fallout rpg its a very good gamebut if you ve played fallout new vegas or 3 and are looking for an rpg similar to fallout 4 s predecessors this game loses a lot of the charm of the previous games the dialogue isn t great the quests are repetitive and i don t feel like the game has any replayability as the players choices aren t as game changing and story altering as new vegas
