2023 i kind of wish steam had a maybe or sort of option because sims 4 has the potential to be a good game but because ea is so money hungry it can t even be bothered to put out barely functional content the wedding stories pack completely breaks weddings even worse than they are in the base game created kits just so they could drain even more money from us and quite frankly we re still being way too patient with ea at this point this is definitely a pricey game which is ironic given that s it s now free to play it s over 1000 to buy all of the dlc which i ll break down for you right here 560 for all 14 expansion packs some of which include features like playable school and careers weather pets and university which you need to pay extra money for in a life simulator plus other feature such as the ability to live in cities islands and mountains 240 for all 12 game packs which are features like supernatural beings werewolves vampires etc camping restaurants spas the aforementioned broken wedding stories pack and then the ever shameless journey to batuu star wars tie in oh and there s another one strangerville that s basically a parody of stranger things shocking i know that lasts like a good hour or so before the story s over 180 for all 18 stuff packs which are usually just collections of furniture clothes and a few new gameplay features that aren t big enough to warrant being a game pack one of these is my first pet stuff which is infamous for being dlc for dlc as you need to own the cats dogs expansion pack in order to even use this one yeah you can t even have a hamster unless you pay 40 dollars extra for another much larger pack and then we have the kits the kits these are basically just pieces of content ea purposely took out of other packs so that they could treat their self admittedly overly loyal fans like cash cows the best examples of this are the bust the dust and throwback fit kits two of the first three kits ea released both of which i am slightly ashamed to admit i actually bought when they first came out this was just before i realized how scummy ea truly was towards sims fans the content in the bust the dust kit whose whole thing was that it had functioning vacuums and would cause dust to start appearing in your sims house whether or not you had a vacuum in it could ve have been lumped in with the laundry day stuff pack and the content from the throwback fit kit which is get this just a small amount of retro athletic wear could have easily easily been added to the fitness stuff pack i don t think i need to explain the logic behind that one and kits were first launched in march of 2021 and as of writing this review july 2023 there are 23 kits in the sims 4 look back at every other category of dlc i ve listed in this review all of those have been around since the 2010 s and yet not a single one of them has hit 20 through this game s entire run with the highest the stuff packs only hitting 18 and yet the kits which have only existed for like two years have already topped them and will likely continue to do so and while yes the kits are only 5 each that s gonna add up eventually so 115 for all 23 kits if we combine the prices for all of the dlc in this game that brings us to the mind numbing wallet draining total of 1 095 for every single dlc in a free to play life simulator which speaking from experience is extremely empty without it the base game is very empty especially once you play it after buying a large amount of the dlc interaction between sims is boring at best to incoherent or nonexistent at worst clothing choices are bland and please please don t make me talk about how bad the skin tones were back when the game first launched all in all sims 4 is just kind of okay you either need a lot of dlc or a lot of high quality custom content to make it worth playing for long periods of time but if you re just looking for something to mess around in for a bit then it s fine edit y all really did not just ask us to vote you for being a labor of love after scamming us for nine years straight
