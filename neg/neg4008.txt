2015 while i had fun in the beginning once you dive into the worlds of cinema and ttt you can see how and awful community if mics and chat aren t being spammed with little kids racist sexist and pornographic content the admin abuse is truly something out of the worst horror stories you ve heard just now i was on cinema and 3 of these main issues occurred 1 in the lobby a man was spamming his mic with some dank memes like m lady and some really messed up mlp 2 while in the theater the only videos that anyone would request was porn mostly gay or some kind of fetish 3 and finally when a normal video would come on the piece of admin would blow up everyone in the theater and all those things bring me here to you right now writing this admittedly angry and hostile review so in conclusion i can say 1 this game and 2 this community p s have a nice day
