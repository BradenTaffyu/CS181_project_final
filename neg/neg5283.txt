2023 updating my review after finishing an ultimate victory on hard difficulty this game is just lacking at full price much like the desert it feels empty and devoid of any unique features i love the historical i e non warhammer total war games and have put close to 2000 hrs into shogun 2 and three kingdoms combined pharoah is a significant letdown in comparison the good beautiful campaign map some quality of life improvements over three kingdoms incremental saves campaign customization options etc performance improved in general well until the game stutters to a halt after a couple hours of play outposts and campaign map movement mechanic is cool and adds significant depth to the gameplay the barter system is awesome and makes economic management much easier if you find yourself in a resource hole financing some ill conceived warthe bad there s no content the game feels empty and basic every faction feels same y in both gameplay and in the court system which is basically identical regardless of if you re a hittite egyptian or canaanite zero sense of grandeur and epic ness ai makes nonsensical and suicidal decisions even on hard difficulty the ai really feels like a massive step backwards from three kingdoms boring repetitive units boring repetitive intrigue court politics boring diplomacy the ui is terrible campaign map armies only show unit count no easy way to tell how your army will match up against another poor battle unit banners memory leak or some other performance issue that occurs after a couple hours of play where performance starts lagging out badly until the game is restarted2023 should have been one of the better years for game releases and instead it s been one ugly cash grab after another greedy publishers are asking full price for half baked rushed games that launch without content and features and it s gotten to be a depressing time to be a gamer
