2018 early access review i played this game for a bit now as i was instantly hooked with the idea of the minecraft zombie combination and it was also one of the first early access games i supported the game plays fun and can be quite challenging especially in you play solo on a random map the crafting element is great and keeps you motivated for quite some time the overall atmosphere is also very fitting and the lighting effects are very nice but after surviving the first few weeks the game gets very tedious and boring you have your weapons arsenal your impenetrable fortress with several layers of defenses and none of the zombie armies the game throws at you stands a single chance of overcoming it after the 7th night you repair the damages and restock your supplies unfortunately there is also only very little and slow development being done on the game after they cashed in on it and worse the unfinished version they released for the ps4 some zombie models are improved added as well as some new buildings but thats about it for the past year or more nothing has been done except bugfixes yes there are some sort of quests now build x find y but that actually only acts as a tutorial for the crafting system so it s about time they declare the game finished and move to beta status or add some more features finite ressources to force you to move rebuild other factions to interact with add some boss zombies for the late game otherwise its worth to look at it during a sale for 10 especially with friends if not don t expect too many things to improve with the game in the future it s only gonna be fun until you get the hang of it
