2022 early access review so here we are my friends after years of waiting after years of hoping after years of broken promises it has all come down to this release day what stands before us is a beaten up soulless pretender for whom wobbles on cheap crutches mount blade ii bannerlord bannerlord struggles with it s identity a lot it either wants to be an e sports multiplayer game which nobody asked for nor wanted or it tries to be a slimmed down console game with much needed and improved game play yes it is playable and yes it is fun in a lot of aspects but at the end of the day fancy new graphics systems and pomp is nothing if it has no soul with release day around the corner it would seem bannerlord will be forever soulless misdirection has once again swooped away another beloved series so go do your self a favour go play warband it didn t have fancy graphics or new systems it had a soul and a great community and for a game such as mount and blade that is everything as without it you have nothing but a hollow husk of a game now with all that said there is still time to save bannerlord if taleworlds somehow manages to surprise us with a huge update on release day or before with all the promised and missing features i will update this review with a thumbs up if not this review will stand forever as a monument to dreams and broken promises remember this review is not for what they can do after release it is for all they promised on release over the many many long years
