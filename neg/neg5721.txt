2014 firstly let s get this out the way whatever way you look at it rome 2 is a disappointment from the farcical siege battles reminiscent of a mexican stand off to the bugged out textures terrrible performance and awful battle mechanics rome 2 really pushes the boat out when it comes to how much a game can be screwed up to put this in perspective i have accumulated over 200 hours on rome 2 during that time i had been forced to restart a rome campaign 7 times due to post release game patching at least 3 4 of my total game time has been campaign restarts testing bugs testing performance and most recently attempting to create a series of videos with a friend that show up all the broken battle mechanics that limit the game so much basically i have spent most of my time trying to get this game to function and trying to squeeze blood from the proverbial stone in trying to eek out a sense of enjoyment in this title of course all this would be acceptable if there were any form of communication from ca or any intents to fix these problems unforunately anybody who highlights these issues is removed from the main forums and treated like dirt customers unite do not buy ca s next title certainly do not preorder it they have no intention of fixing rome 2 up to an acceptable standard and any attempt to establish communication on the subject results in a banhammer on the main forum it is about time that we as customers said no this is not ok you cannot release a product under false pretenses then proceed to silence the critics it is truly amazing that they would have time to release dlc s like cig but still have the audacity to refuse to fix the main game properly do not buy avoid it is the plague normally i would recommend shogun 2 to anybody who wanted to try a polished ca product but right now i am rather angry at the company for the way i have been treat personally recently hence the decision to actually review this game yours sincerely a bitter ca customer
