2018 ca liking tweets that call your fans nazis for commenting that you are changing your game to become less realistic than it was for shame i ve been a fan of total war since shogun 1 but it seems you don t want customers to feel immersed in your games since you support comments calling us nazis your fans will remember this betrayal and we will talk with our money until you undertand the people you re backing now aren t the people who are buying your games they re not even gamers who are you selling your games to if not gamers how is your company going to make a profit with no consumers who s going to buy your products when you ve angered your fanbase you re a business and you mess with the consumer at your peril as for myself i was really looking forward to three kingdoms and now i learn of this stupid thing seems like i m going to have to wait a looooong time until you earn my trust back remember the saying get woke go broke
