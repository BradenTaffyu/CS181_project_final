2023 a fun game at its core but too much micromanaging and grind times spread across far too many fields to truly be a long term game how can someone expect to play a game when their brand new vehicles cannot be repaired or put out a fire it is my understanding that may have finally changed but since launch that was just how it was now the economy is being nerfed further making grinds longer yet i cannot recommend a game with such a tenacious predatory and greedy drive to pull any red cent possible out of a player by simply making everything as tedious as possible to do otherwise edit 5 5 hours via steam several hundred logged prior to steamlink new edit i still hate this game but cant stop coming back to try and enjoy it for a while now and again
