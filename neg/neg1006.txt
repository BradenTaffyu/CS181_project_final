2017 for everything this game does right it gets a laundry list of things wrong turning a beloved and unique series of games praised for its freedom to craft your own experiance and playstyle into a only four options open world shooter as either a army veteran looking for his son or a lawyer looking for for there son while the map is fairly large with a fair few loacations to explore it really suffers from the saying a mile wide but an inch deep jumping from location to location in the hopes of finding glue like some kind addict not to mention that the characters in said world are just as badly thought out with little to no saving grace as they plead you to build there villages and save there loved ones would be nice if there was a do it yourself option but no the world comes to complete stand still until you realise you have nothing better to do and then it somehow gets worse as the dlc was coming out only 3 of the 6 could properly be called an expention half of which only addind things which were at the time already modded into the game only with the gaul to try and charge money for it and even then just a bug filled mess of broken items and useless junk the other 3 were actually ok at least adding new mechanics and such but ultimatly learning nothing from the inital release as it suffer again from the poory thought out and lackluster experiance but the worst part of it all for whatever reason not content with all the money they arguably swindled from many long time fans they have the the audacity to try and push paid mods again something what was met with deserved and abundant backlash in what seems like a final attempt to shake off whatever support they had as they attempt to charge frankly absurd ammounts of money for something that already exists for free trying to charge money for reskined pipboys which can be done in less than 10 minuets by anyone with image editing software all said and done its a once loved series now tarnished with a garbage game coupled with garbage buisness practices and completely undeserving of its beyond the pail community willing with each release to not only fix the broken mess they created but give an almost inexaustable ammount of content if you want a good fallout game get yourself new vegas because you wont be able to get anything else close to its quality for a long time if bethesda keeps doing what its doing
