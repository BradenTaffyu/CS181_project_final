2014 sad what was once a great simulation has turned into a big middle finger to loyal followers dlcs that should have been released with the original game because let s face it even on release it was still a beta i have followed bohemia since operation flashpoint and i loved their games and their attention to realism arma 3 could have been so much but releasing half dlcs instead of the old good hardy dlcs you use to get with arma 2 and still not fixing glitches i can no longer support this game heck even all the arma clans that switched to arma 3 is suffering membership loss due to the unplayability of this game on multiplayer and that s where this game really shined at one point it s a sad day
