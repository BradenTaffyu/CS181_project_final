2020 early access review the good the bad and the damn right ugly short edition firstly i m a die hard mount and blade fan and have been watching this closely for a long time now i m currently playing the game and have put 24 hours in already sad right but i enjoy the game style so much the good exactly what we wanted a mount and blade game they did not try and become something they are not good foundation to build upon not as many bugs as there could be the bad the bugs that do exist are game breaking nothing new same old features we loved however nothing new or expanded re skin of warband at the moment lack of depth in all the features the ugly 8 year s development laughable release either they went through a new lead every half year or the current leadership have never made a game before absolutely zero depth the game lacks any real content apart from the usual and expected the game draws you in with a beautiful start and raises your hope only to drop kick you directly in the scrotum when you look under the hood nothing to master serious bugs that turn 14 hour saves into junk i mean did they even play test their own game conclusion this is a pish poor excuse for a mount and blade game in 2020 the development team should be ashamed of what they have released even for early access i seriously believe a team of 20 kids fresh out from university with 12 months and a limited budget could produce a better more feature rich game than this this game makes me heart cry since i know this game is still years away from being what it should be now in early access you should only buy this game is you have money to waste otherwise save yourself some money and wait 2 3 years when they release what i think they hoped to release due to budget reasons staff issues talent problems or what ever pathetic reason taleworlds have it s most of all a shame as long as the company does not go bust i m sure after a few years it will be good enough to be early access then modders can take over and make the game what it should have been
