balatro is a neat concept but the game mechanics are just frustrating paired with no real sense of progression there s no way to fix a run you can build your deck enjoy your run and just into a boss that says no and there s nothing you can do about it there isn t time to rebuild no way to recover it s just frustrating and can t really recommend the game in good conscious
