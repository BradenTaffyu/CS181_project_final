2016 bandai namco responsible for a half ass poorly optimized port of a game and acting as enablers for hackers and cheaters they also seem hesitant on fixing either one of these issues and instead blaming their consumers i thought you were better than this bandai come on placing the blame on players for taking advantage of an in game feature that s meant to be taken advantage of seriously i don t care how good your game is if you re gonna be that irresponsible with it this level of laziness and negligence cannot be condoned edit is everyone marking the review as not helpful looking at nothing but the red thumbs down and the playtime and ignoring what the actual review says seriously again i don t hate the game like some people are suggesting i hate bandai s management of it and find a large part of its functionality and content not worth the risk of using because of the way they re doing things it s the equivalent of serving people frozen or undercooked food in a restaurant and then saying oh well you should ve checked the food more thoroughly and brought a portable microwave before buying after they complain developers should not be allowed to place the blame of their own malfunctioning products on the buyers
