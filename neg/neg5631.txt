2014 i bought this game as soon as it came out i even preordered it in full i was so excited needless to say as you all know it was absolutely terrible when it came out but i didn t jump ship immediately i waited it out the devs continuously patched the game the community pulled together with mods and the like but now months after its release i just finished a 20 hour playthrough and even with over a dozen mods and all the patches and fixes they put into it its still terrible i had this realization that i was putting all this time and effort into this game to just make it playable forget making it fun the game is beyond salvaging and is a true lost cause a black mark on rts gaming history which cant be removed avoid like the plague
