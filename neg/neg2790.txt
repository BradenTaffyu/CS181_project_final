2016 diplomacy is weak for a grand strategy game ai is problematic for the time being mid game content is not enough late game crisis events feel out of place ai is retarded for both vassal allies that keeps following your biggest fleet during the war war score system is broken in this game you can vassalize an empire that s 2x bigger than yours for only 60 of the warscore but you can t cede more than 4 planets because the war score is too high overall this game is unfinished it s better for you to wait for an expansion pack
