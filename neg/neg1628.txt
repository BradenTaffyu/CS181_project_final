2022 early access review don t buy this scam game stop they ve waited 9 f ing years to develop showed gameplay in 2017 and released the game exactly like the 2017 version with a story which i should add they said it was going to be so deep that s as long as a kindergarten student s vocabulary knowledge and content so little you d think they started making the game 1 week before the release if they ve said i could write a story for them in like an hour which would be 100x times better than this they gave us and like it s not already enough it s been in early access for the last 3 years as a fan of the franchise i hate taleworlds with all my soul
