2023 first game review on steam i told everyone you can trust paradox they made awesome cities skylines i game but after trying the sequel 2 game some hours every day since launch it gets worse and worse the longer you progress into the game it s in such a bad state that it now bsod my pc every time it wants to save the game and random times too game is so unstable and glitchy that it s beyond my imagination that it was released so early in development i like many other negative reviewers had such big faith and hope in paradox to deliver an amazing product but this early version of the game is simply not that i know the game over time will be fixed but that cannot justify the state you launch the game in and ask for full price when its clearly not up to that standard of price range had to put out a warning to buyers
