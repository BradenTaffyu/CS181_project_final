2021 i ve played about 12 hours since i wrote that last review i came back with the game being given away free in epic as i was able to talk a few friends into playing this game since they got it for free i was able to find a backup of my whole drive that was still a bit out of date and i did have to buy some things over again but most of my stuff is back while there are some new bugs that have come out since i played last the game still seems pretty stable for the most part i m having fun again and was able to bring some friends along something that i d really like to see would be a multi player vehicle a 4 seat side by side or truck something so we can actually go out as a hunting party i am very worried about the save games still i played alaska got the bug where i couldn t fast travel anywhere and the next time i played it said my saved game was corrupted it was able to recover it and i don t think i lost anything but that does not give me any confidence in the new save system they added since i played last i m still leaving my original review below because i still don t trust the game and if i hadn t been able to find a backup that i made months before i would not be playing this again at all this game is fun but the fact that they opted to not use the steam backup and only store your save data in appdata which nothing backs up has completely ruined this game i lost every bit of progress i had in the 151 3 hours i ve played and i will likely never play this or any of their games ever again
