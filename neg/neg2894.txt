2018 review of 2 6 patchi had been struggling to even run a decent huge galaxy from 2 2 megacorp launch it seems that while they did focus and fixed most if not all late game issues my problem is not with how well they fixed performance but that stellaris is struggling to run past 2300 on huge galaxy without any form of stutter or bottleneck for example i am running a huge galaxy with 20 ais and typical setting and 2 5 worlds 60 years in i am seeing micro stutter every other day after just barely 50 years in 1 9 1 used to run so much faster than this on huge galaxy and back then stellaris had to do alll kind of ftl calculations it seems odd to me that population faction pathfinding take up a bigger chuck of main thread processing time at least that is my guess after two years of waiting for 2 6 federation patch i have to cut my losses and time at some point that point is here now old old review of 2 0 combat mechanicminor update even after 2 0 2 patch which fixed a few broke mechanics and re adjusted war weariness most of my issues are still a problem first off let me preface i have been pretty much against the rework ftl from the beginning for reasons that has been already discussed to death in ftl discussion thread so i won t go over those for this review secondly i am not going to go too much into broken mechanic auto exploration refusing to survey solar systems that are empty not surveyed as one such example only talking about mechanic that actually works thirdly i have been playing stellaris for at least 3 days by now i have tried two different games small galaxy with determined exterminator and large galaxy with tall spiritualist now for my review early game feel so much slower i believe most of this feeling comes from the fact that hyperlane was made the only starting ftl you can use and the fact that you have to travel at sublight speed between nodes now there are both good and bad side effect from this change the good side effect is that you have more time to react if someone declare an early game war against you the bad side effect is that many many civilian especially science constructor ships suffer a lot from this which bring me to my next point early game and late game exploration effort has been so drastic differently between my two earlier game i mention like i said earlier science ship suffer a lot from having to travel at sublight between hyperlane node from what little i have seen it just means that you need to unlock better sublight engine asap to reduce travel time by a substantive amount while the ftl tech only boost the spin time by a few day each ftl jump meanwhile better sublight speed allow you to reduce travel time easily by a month there are also certain solar system which slow down sublight speed by 50 if it was a longer multiple ftl jump i don t think this is an intent side effect but that is what it is now i can not believe i am saying this but putting more ai on the map regardless of the actual galaxy size involved indirectly hurts your exploration effort too much in a such way that the rework ftl has a huge detrimental effect you would expect as a determined exterminator you would have access to less space to exploration due to automatic border closing the thing is after 130 years as tall spiritualist large galaxy with max normal ai and 4 fallen empire no advance empire i only had 3 fragment and two were gifted to me which meant i discovered only one via normal means while as determined exterminator i manage to finish the exploration event chain before the other 3 ai empire on small galaxy no fallen empire or advance empire border touched mine in the early game phase bottom line i discovered the cybrax homeworld and could claim it for the ring world no benefit to machine empire as mine which is bizarre feeling but i will put it down due to sheer luck ironically i did indeed predict that the overall exploration would be hurt but i did not expect that the number of ai on the galaxy map would have a drastic overall effect on your exploration effort like this i am still not sure that the edict abilities migrate changing from using influence only to using several possible resource from food to energy and unity overall expect to have more influence income overall as opposite to 1 9 1 or earlier however it was a good change for determined exterminator which meant it is easier to move many population at once to sector in order to not waste your time to micro manage obsolete robot population but outside of that i find that it just add more complexity for little gain for everybody else in certain cases you use food instead of energy and other thing you have to keep in mind when playing different govt for example do i use 900 energy for 10 on a small empire or is it better to get more population and use then how do i quantify 900 energy for 20 growth i have not done much experiment with combat or even with warscore thus far but i find that the fleet command vs naval capacity to be little harmful for tall empire because often you will ending up with 80 fleet command limit and you only can support up to 30ish naval capacity so you have to completely ignore fleet command tech and grow more wider to just take full advantage of higher fleet command limits for example in my tall game i have 100 fleet command limits but i can only support up to 72 naval command limits which meant that doomstack is still the way to go for tall empire at least until you unlock habitat ringworld and start spamming them with my determined exterminator i did indeed have to split and have multiple fleet on different fronts so your experience may be different td lr i am not happy with the general direction that stellaris is going in even although there are some nice changes
