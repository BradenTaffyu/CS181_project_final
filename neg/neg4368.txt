the core gameplay is great but the ai is so garbage that i ve discovered i never had a satisfying match it s like playing a game of soccer against toddlers here s a list of things the ai is bad at or will never do they don t use generals strategically when they get an admiral they sail it around like a scout and never use its bonus if you do not share a border with a civ you are at war with they will never be a threat because the ai cannot comprehend moving units in a way that is not linear i have never seen an ai put aircraft on an aircraft carrier i have never seen an ai use a weather balloon with artillery without the weather balloon artillery is essentially useless i have never seen an ai use a medic guru s yes however i have never seen an ai build a fort not an encampment naval combat is pathetic one time a few of my frigates ran into an enemy submarine the sub could have destroyed my ships but it never attacked and i was able to whittle the sub down in a few turns and kill it this made no sense every game play s out the same all ai are very powerful and aggressive at the beginning but if you are able to survive to the industrial era all ai no matter the difficulty just starts to disintegrate ai doesn t seem to know how to build a modern military if you destroy its military in the medieval era they don t seem to build it back let s be honest combat is the most fun part of the game so the fact that the ai is so terrible at it takes away the best part of the game when you don t align with their ideals they have to interrupt the game to tell you constantly it s super annoying and childish
