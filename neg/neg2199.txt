2016 do not get this game i ve played this game for more than 600 hours in ground forces now and i really can t recommend it at it s current state the game itself would be good if there would be more players and a better matchmaking system the graphics and models are good also there are no flamers in the community but letting tiger 2 s fight against t 54 s and is3 s is4 s when you can t even touch them in the tiger frontally is just a joke also there is no russian bias itself its just the thing that the russian tanks are way to undertiered to fight the germans brits or americans you have to spend alot of time and money into this game to get some tanks which are actually fun to drive like tiger i s or t34 s to be honest i hate world of tanks but since warthunder doesn t give a single crap about its community and players you should rather play that instead of wartunder
