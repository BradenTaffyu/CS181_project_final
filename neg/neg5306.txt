2023 this game will ruin your life not magic the gathering that s a great game but you should play cube and proxy cards so you re not burning money for the oppressive glutenous tyrants that work at hazbro they control what you draw and who you play against so they control your win rate sometimes it feels like mtg arena controls these things in a way to give you the least satisfying way possible which is quite likely as a tactic to proc you for more dopamine and encourage you to spend money any penny you spend on this game is a waste you ll lose 6 times in a row to getting land screwed and get all your spells brutally countered or all your creatures removed and then you ll win 4 games in a row from an opponent conceding before you get the chance to do anything or from simply playing against someone so bad i seriously wonder if they re a bot planted to give people free wins plus there s the fact that every format is becoming worse and worse so even if mtg arena wasn t rigged and made to be unfun by the matchmakers it would still be unfun because the game is simply not balanced and it s in shambles also fun story january of 2022 i played a bunch and made it to mythic tier that s the only time i ve made it past platinum and the only other time i made it to platinum was in janurary where upon being 2 wins away from diamond teir i kid you not i lost 20 games in a row 40 of which were land screws another 40 were problems with the autotapper timeouts or connection errors and the last 20 were just insane match ups so i was brought all the way back down to the bottom of platinum tier amazing this game will simply make you feel bad about yourself get angry get into a toxic dopamine cycles hopefully you re lucky enough to have a good playgroup for magic who isn t toxic this game is about the gathering after all about the community for that same reason it would be good if we as a player base actually stood up against this kinda bs happening to our game
