2023 thumbs down to this game for several reasons the gist of it just not as good as civ 5 there will be a continuous theme that i will try to lay out as i write this the game either lacks any sense or it does not have any logical sense do not get me wrong the game is fun i was entertained and hooked for some amount of time but the decisions made in this game are glaring when compared to civ 5 it is sad to see a decline from such a great game dlc are terrible do not add much value and overly priced not really worth your time the whole aesthetics of the game is pretty fortnite like to me civ 5 was also a bit cartoon ish but it felt way more serious and impactful you were an actual leader of the world trying to achieve your goals civ 6 feels like a circus everything seems as it is a joke very cartoon like and magical obviously the game is very beautiful and looks superb the tone is completely off and firaxis has deviated way too much to please who after seeing a few interviews it seems they are trying to get a more whimsical crowd to play the game civ 5 is better graphics in this game are amazing early game civilisations late game civilisations i do not know if this is accurate but from what i have seen being able to snowball early can mean you become unbeatable not really balanced i enjoy this aspect of the game very much but the bonuses each civilisation has are too strong combat is sincerely unbalanced and very punishing if you do not know the meta there are so many bloody bonuses from religion governors unique traits etc i have watched people get 20 combat bonus or more on their units and it seems insane forget deity in multiplayer you can get trashed by a military that is behind scientifically very easily you have to get these bonuses and know how to get them or you will get trashed in multiplayer the rock paper scissor still works very well in this entry but units are also quite forgettable nothing beats england s long bowmen from civ 5 or ship of the line combat feels very smooth and easy to understand even though rng can be a problem gameplay is pretty trash i cannot think of a single mechanic that civ 6 has improved to civ 5 i think the only mechanic that was good was spies religion is boring and the game play is not entertaining i do not know anyone who really tries to win through religion it is awfully tedious i am the most ignorant about this aspect you have to place districts and wonders on tiles which restricts your territory and placing these in a certain formation grants you from minor bonuses to massive ones why because the game developers said so my gripe is wonders and districts take an entire tile removing bonuses the land was giving you and giving you an adjacency bonuses if it is next to certain other districts improvements resources and wonders most of these bonuses in the game make no logical sense for some civilisations the bonuses can be massive it restricts your freedom on how you want to build your cities you can play however you like but the repercussions are huge if you do not optimise your cities and it causes you to micromanage your cities twice as much as you would in civ 5 it causes games to prolong way too much adding several hours to your sessions once you get to end game it is so tedious to continue playing so many little details which has to be taken into account and no way to automate i wish i could hire governors to automate cities for me because i really do not want to have to give orders every single turn for mundane stuff thankfully there is shift enter to skip all orders and end turn age of wonders has a fantastic mechanic which is idle cities produce merchandise automatically which gives you bonus gold depending on your production god such a simple mechanic and firaxis cannot even fathom a solution to this civ 5 is better just because none of these bonuses exist and wonders are placed automatically in one of your tiles giving a nice subtle aesthetic look to your cities i miss being able to automate my workers nope that does not exist here micromanage is once again very tedious i personally sell or kill all my workers after a certain era because it starts becoming more annoying than beneficial my personal view is they should just remove workers from the game and replace it with a different mechanic also workers having 3 charges then disappear is probably the worst mechanic in this game i would understand if my worker was building the pyramids it would probably die but a farm my worker makes 3 farms and it dies what is the logic behind it at least make workers not have charges when you reach a certain era or research workers right or something probably has to do with balance civ 5 is better in every way eureka and inspirations are absolute garbage they force you into playing one way pigeon hole you into a meta to maximise your research and culture which are extremely important in civ 6 basically you have a checklist of things to do not doing this checklist punishes you severely do not have iron around you get punished do not want to build spearman and use it to kill a unit you get punished no hills to build mines you get punished what is the punishment research and culture taking more turns to complete how many turns could you have saved 40 of the total time which is massive this system should be scrapped great persons is a terribly implemented mechanic because it is a competition on who can generate the most points in the respective field to lure a great person or buy them with gold or faith this has some logic to it but lets be honest great persons should never run out and some great people are born into a civilisation just like in civ 5 in civ 6 if you cannot compete in anyway you cant have a great person of that field and they run out which means you need to snag them early or on time also each great person has a unique bonus or active ability which can give once again massive bonuses which no one else can get it creates a mini race for great persons if you do not participate your opponent will become very powerful civ 5 does this way way better if they wanted to improve this mechanic it should be a spy feature like it has happened historically for instance albert einstein or many of the nazi scientists that were either were smuggled out or captured during world war ii to work on several different projects which led the usa to win the space race the spy feature could be steal scientist if a certain civilisation has a great person born there are so many solutions to this yet they went with this dreary silly implementation spies in civ 6 have several cool additions to game play like sabotage production but unfortunately not an important aspect of the game spies effectiveness is very low for the amount of effort you need to get them stealing art and research can be cool and necessary to win reality is once you get spies and promote them so they are efficient usually the game is almost over or the fate of the game is already sealed the game can be so quick now most late game mechanics are not worth getting governors are absolute garbage another mechanic that adds bonuses that can scale to abusive amounts few of the governors suck not every city can have a governor and promotions can only be received through civics this could have been a great mechanic in which every city can toggle what it wants to pursue and give small bonuses for having respective buildings tiles districts and such instead we have a very restrictive system that again has no logical sense pigeon holes you into a certain build and bonuses are too game changing i could keep trashing gameplay but let us leave it here civ 5 is ultimately way better in my eyes
