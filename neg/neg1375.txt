2020 early access review this game is amazing don t me wrong singleplayer is a bit stale but it s in ea so i can t complain much my biggest issue with the game is the fact that china has a monopoly over the east asia servers they ban anyone from playing if they see them promoting anti chinese ideals in games this is utterly unacceptable and as a hong konger who like many others hate the ccp i have to protest against this tw should fix this issue as freedom of speech is vital and chinese censorship should not spread and affect others who are allowed to speak freely absolute disgrace
