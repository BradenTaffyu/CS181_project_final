2021 thehunter cotw aka thehunter call of the water lakes being the only good place to hunt kill everything for exp and let god sort it out the reaper would be impressed who else indiscriminately kills everything they see recommending this game or not is a hard call for me but in the end it has to be a thumbs down it would easily be a thumbs up if the bugs and imbalances were fixed but that never seems to happen i enjoy the outdoors having lived in colorado my entire life i enjoy hunting especially with bows from stealth i actually enjoy the stalking experience of following tracks using callers lures to bring animals in and yet the game is so damn buggy and inconsistent that the zen like experience that might be gained while playing is forcibly ripped from you and replaced with frustration and hours of googling why things don t work pros1 good outdoor graphics and atmospheric effects2 fairly realistic ballistics for all weapons including wind effects3 meaningful hit detection on animals and their body parts organs4 good ish stealth mechanics with animal senses in tune5 a decent selection of hunting maps each with their own look feel and unique animals6 bows can be fun and very useful once you buy the dlc and get the hang of them7 mods can help with some of the game problems but not nearly allcons1 skills don t have enough of an effect on performance2 highly limited skill perk points available even at max level3 some skills perks are highly buggy soft feet works in reverse sometimes extra grass bush foliage noise can stick persisting out into open low grass areas rinse repeat for other skills perks4 sleeping even in a tent costs a significant amount of money every time5 bloodhound ai is utterly worthless often moving you out of cover or blocking a shot6 many missions are totally broken with necessary animals in a zone being missing7 animals de spawn from the world randomly unrelated to view distance 8 sounds are mixed terribly meaning environmental sounds can literally deafen you9 blinds are terribly implemented i don t know anyone that uses them10 stands free and tree are limited on the map and spook things within 200m when placed11 hunting structures are totally worthless and cost a large amount of money to construct12 no way to quick switch ammo sights etc i e carry one bow and quickly change ammo 13 short range on lures and scents and zero ui indicators of what you have on you 14 no way to hotkey multiple use only type skills beyond just 1 at a time 15 extremely short view distance for animals they de render past 400m or so16 perks affecting scent lures don t also affect scent cover17 abysmally small inventory space backpacks are never used due to huge sight sound penalties 18 the difference between bagging small large huge animals for money xp is virtually negligible19 more difficult shots range windage day or night don t get any additional reward a 10m shot a 500m shot 20 handguns shotguns are all but unnecessary in cotw a rifle and or bow if you like them is all that s needed 21 to make significant progress with your skills perks you ll end up killing thousands if not tens of thousands of animals 22 walking up to and jumping over a hip high fence makes as much noise as driving an atv23 no official modding support any update can break any mod at any time summaryi could go on and on with the cons about the game but it s pretty clear that poor design decisions imbalances and huge number of bugs is what destroys the fun factor and zen experience the game could have for now the only thing keeping me playing even a little bit is bow hunting and only because i love bows and stalking obtaining that zen experience in any game is very important to me and it is hard to do with cotw fighting it every step of the way the developers appear to have stopped any kind of meaningful patching old bugs are allowed to go on for years literally and new bugs creep in with every new dlc which is unfortunately the thrust of the dev s focus bringing in more money on a game they don t appear to have any interest in fixing or balancing bottom line if you find the game at a huge discount and are firmly convinced you can look past all the bugs and just see the game as a casual open world lake hunting experience a bit of an oxymoron but meh you might like some of what it brings but steel yourself for the inevitable frustration
