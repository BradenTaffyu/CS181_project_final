2018 this is a great game i certainly can t deny that as many other reviewers have noted however the dlc is completely out of control i m not even going to complain about the price because it s entirely possible to get most of it for 50 or even 75 percent off on sale what deeply irritates me about the dlc is that the game is never complete if i want to play the full final definitive version of a game like civilization v i only have to buy two dlcs if i want to play the full final definitive version of battlefield 1 i have to buy four dlcs which is a little more expensive but still doable with this game though there will apparently never be an ultimate version of the game since there is no end in sight for dlc releases playing a game that completely changes every 6 months is deeply frustrating since i don t have unlimited time to learn every feature of every new release i m glad i own the game but i can t recommend buying it for that reason steam tells me i ve played an additional 500 hours so here s an update the dlc situation has not improved all the packs after rights of man have been either a minor tweaks to countries that were already fully fleshed out or b absurd power fantasies that take the game even further away from an alternate history simulator there were also a couple of catastrophically buggy releases although at least those seem to have been fixed at this point i can t seem to stop playing it but you shouldn t start
