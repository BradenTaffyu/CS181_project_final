2019 early access review as a gamer for 30 odd years this was the most fun addictive and scientific game i ve played in my life it will require you to have a solid knowledge of circuit theory hydraulics fluid dynamics and an ability to solve an overall complex survival problem if you don t seek online tutorials with others explaining how these things work in the game this game caused me to neglect my real life in every way including skipping various meals for one week straight i ve never played a game this addictive before that was until and given how addicting it is i m actually relieved i m writing this i realized there was one absolute deal breaker for me that no matter how great the game is this deal breaker completely kills the immersion and how i enjoy playing this sort of game what s the deal breaker i encountered causing my heart to completely sink the map sizes are limited the reason the map sizes being limited is a deal breaker for me is because i like to play this sort of game with grand visions of expansion in my mind the game has the tools within it via automation gates and electronics that you could probably program a real life turing complete computer in it that s what makes it addictive its potential seems unlimited i m also the sort of player that rather than sitting down trying to optimize efficiency everywhere i d rather just expand extract more resources and build an even bigger megabase because it s not a big deal if i waste resources i can just mine them elsewhere willing to take all the risks that that might involve and the game does present acceptable real risks when mining far away locations i have long term visions of abandoning my bases and creating perfect new ones with complex base structures that are potentially huge none of this is possible in the game due to the limited map size in fact the more i played it the more i realized this wasn t the sort of game that i thought it was at all it s rather an efficiency game it s about surviving with a pre determined amount of mineable resources that cannot be increased the limited map size means that the copper iron water and energy sources are strictly predetermined when the game starts at map generation it s like playing minecraft with a limited map size it s the same sort of feeling with minecraft in that respect if i ever encountered an artificial wall in minecraft that game wouldn t have anything interesting about it at all the feeling of infiniteness that makes minecraft unique would be gone completely that s the exact feeling i felt in this game when i realized the map size is limited and this fixed map is not even that big really especially when you go hunting for renewable energy sources there are various sources of unlimited energy such as natural gas geysers and various sources of other unlimited substances and gases such as chlorine geysers the problem is that these geysers only omit a certain amount of gas per second if your compelx base needs more gas or energy than these geysers can provide per second you re out of luck and since the map size is limited there aren t all that many of these geysers in it anyway perhaps 2 3 or each type max things like mineable copper are strictly limited to a fixed amount and don t even have anything equivalent to these geysers that means your entire grand vision of expansion and complex base building is ruined when you realize that your per second consumption rate of energy or any other resource is limited and pre determined when the map is generated in summation i d call the reason for this negative review being the feeling of playing a game like minecraft with a limited map size the game has nothing to do with minecraft but that is the only succinct and accurate way i can describe the dealbreaker i encountered at least for me if a limited map size wouldn t be a dealbreaker for you then for sure you ll enjoy this game if you re like me and enjoy expanding and creating complex things even if they contain various inefficiencies then no doubt you ll feel the same way as i do the amount of copper and iron you have to build your circuits the amount of sandstone you have to build your walls all of it is limited and the limited map size isn t that large really once i realized the map had walls that i couldn t go beyond the game suddenly felt like i was trapped in an ant colony being examined by someone outside it with all the limitations that the glass walls of an ant colony have the entire feeling of immersion was gone in a way this is all a good thing since the game presented itself as the most addicting thing that i don t know when or if i could have ever stopped playing it already my girlfriend was acting suss about my lack of attention to her so all in all i m thankful for writing this negative review as it allowed me snap back into reality and realize this otherwise perfectly addicting game isn t what i thought it was at all
