2016 this game is utterly broken some will like the new features some will dislike them that s a matter of personal preference when i say the game is broken i mean game breaking crashes i have read the forums and the best fix for the crash to desktop at the next turn bug is to declare war on everyone sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t at turn 300 when your game becomes unplayable no matter what sequence of events you try to stop it crashing it gets pretty frustrating wait a few months before buying wait until the bugs are ironed out this game is still in beta absolute waste of money and now i have multiple save games stuck at particular turns which means i ve wated my time too
