2018 edit after all i really enjoy playing this and others tw games but everyone must know this ca was just caught inserting redshell spyware into their games while some people are stating redshell transmits purely harmless analytics data the fact that ca was completely silent about it looks shady simply deleting the redshell file will cause steam to download it again when you launch the game and if you block the ports redshell uses to communicate then your game will not launch people thinking of buying this game should be aware for more information check out
