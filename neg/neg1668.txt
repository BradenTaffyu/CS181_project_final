the game isn t bad but i think it has to be the worst in the series for many reasons for starters we all know that the beloved owners are an abusive company on the other hand without the dlc it s almost empty and having to spend over a thousand dollars doesn t help at all personally i bought it before it became free and we didn t get anything significant honestly if you can pirate the dlc don t feel bad it s the least it deserves qualification 4 10 garbage company
