2018 t2 has decided to illegaly even per the original licenses terms change the eula and enforce people to click i accept through steam in order to be able to update not only is it against the original terms which i actually did accept at the time of purchase it is also unlawful to amend the rights or license after it being purchased to be blunt any changes would have to be accepted by the customer or the customer holds the right to hold the other party to our original agreement hereby i also inform taketwo indirectly of my decision to click i accept while not actually agreeing to the terms for contractual obligatory extortion which this now has become is rated as a crime in eu law i strongly advise taketwo to at the very least let a human look at the eula and how it very clearly interferes with ksp s modus operandi it s been running at the very least the past 2 years also i d like to mention i find it strongly coincidental the eula mentions no credit has to be given to mod owners whose code may be stolen injected and that the latest patch mainly seems to include the resize everything mod s features i strongly vouch for the gameplay ksp has to offer but only when we can keep respecting the modding community which has leveraged the game from a concept to being actually a fun experience due to t2 not being able to honor even our original agreement by even trying to make unilateral changes to that agreement and at the same time conflicting with eu consumer protection laws i ve decided to report this product for legal offense
