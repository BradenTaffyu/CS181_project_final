2018 would of before nowadays i can t the game has way too much dlc that not even both your kidneys could cover the cost for those who haven t bought it here s how it works you spend 35 on this game only to realise you can t do anything without dlc 1 so you end up buying most if not all the dlc ignoring the skin packs and all that stuff so really you end up spending like 200 300 depending on when you buy this game because paradox isn t going to stop dlc whoring anytime soon instead this covers you for a couple of months then the next adventure happens so paradox release an update after a couple of months normally completely changing an entire section of the game fair enough but what they do is that they lock core mechanics you need to actually manage that section of the game and to unlock said part you need to buy the 10 15 dlc they release with that update this causes an issue because unless you buy that dlc you re pretty much stuffed as a country thus forcing you to buy the dlc if you do buy this game believe me it is fun but i wouldn t judge you at all for pirating the dlc its a bad practice but paradox is abusing their fans with this dlc policy they have going on ontop of the game already being a heafty 35
