2017 the vanilla game is a barebones experience to lure you in to buy the dlc it worked for me and works for many the base game gets boring after a couple playthroughs the only reason i have 400 hours is cause of mods and dlc and mods were the overwhelming majority of these hours i dont regret the hours i put into this game but i do regret the money i gave to a company who put what seems to be minimal effort into this title the horrid dlc is one thing but theres also the many gameplay issues that annoy the heck gotta be family friendly outta me the ai is broken germany will blindly declare war when they havent finished another like declaring war on denmark and norway when the allies are at the gates of berlin the ai completely neglects its shorelines and cities so you can easily take over a nation in weeks with paratroopers and naval invasions especially italy and france nations will completely abandon their frontlines as you roll across their country and they do nothing to stop you the representation of troops leads to the late game being an absolute mess and the game generally just runs bad the game at its base is not worth the 40 they want you to shell out and the half decent experience isnt worth the cost of all the dlc id only recommend this to people who really like strategy and have alot of cash to spare and want to support these horrid dlc policies
