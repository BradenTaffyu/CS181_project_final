2022 fh5 is a really great game but i can t recommend it because for me it s horizon 4 with a new map i think the game mostly improved in the areas where it was already good and became only worse in it s weak spots so at this moment i believe that it makes more sense to buy horizon 4 with discount pros basically all the pros of horizon 4 so i keep it short graphics is great car sounds are good soundtrack is okay plenty of cars flexible tuning large map cons no feeling of progression at all game just throws at you the best cars in first 20 hours of gameplay you can open almost everything from a wheelspins without do a single race in a race game ai maybe it was the same in horizon 4 but in this game it looks so fake many times i have a situation when i overtake all the drivatars and they just form a train and ride like this one after another on exactly the same line till the finish so they don t even try to imitate the real race and competition and yes they don t care about the game physics if race has a jumps or water in it drivatars have a huge advantage because the terrain doesn t affect their cars you re a superstar 111 it is way too much this time all these radio announcements sound so unnatural you are praised for absolutely everything they don t reward they just cause facepalms stories are mostly meaningless and dialogs are weird in one of the stories there is a phrase like why people don t like sandstorms they re so fun i mean there should be a line somewhere in being so optimistic and positive right horizon has so great potential for a proper singleplayer campaign but it s just a waste of time now constant interruptions new adventure new wheelspin new level after a race dancing before the race why dancing after a race why i can t say much about the online because it constantly disconnects me i was able to complete only a few races and i still can t find an option to find a race in a specific class it s so frustrating why i can t choose a race type and a car class so i can drive my favourite car in online race
