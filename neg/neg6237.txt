2023 as so many have said before i wish they had an award for something in the middle first off rogue trader just installed on my rig the day this was written until then it was a pita to get running and i paid the 99 for the alpha beta test phase so aside im not super deep into it yet but im finding im enjoying it i like games like this yknow lots of story interesting characters i wish the eldar was a dude because they ve fallen into that rut where anytime an eldar has a place in a game its always a female now the funny thing is in lore or at least old school lore as far as i remember the only female fighting force and exarch were the screaming banshees a damn cool unit but still the striking skorpions the warp spiders always showed dudes but now for some reason its always a chick i dont have anything against girls in games i like the fact that we have a sister of battle in the game they dont get much coverage im just disappointed that eldar seem to be pigeon holed now unless they re drucharii whatever the game is a lot like any other strategy rpg theres a story you read the story you find your mates do stuff for them piss them off they leave make them happy they stay i dunno if theres romance but then again i dont really care so far the story has been interesting and i was able to swap out their original portraits for one of my own owlcat suck with portraits the character creation is the best they ve ever done which isnt saying much but compared to all their other games its good im trying not to compare it with bg3 like everyone said we shouldnt do p but yknow that is the bar now bg3 goty and such probably gonna win more than that when the steam awards are announced in january i know trader is going to have its moments the combat is solid very similar to wrath of the righteous but not so bloody confusing dip here for 1 lvl dip here for 4 then dipdipdipdip all that just lemme play a character that doesnt have to dip into everything and for some reason ive come to hate that word dip like moist it just i dont like it now i digress again i think rogue trader is going to be a solid rpg thats worth playing i dont think its going to break any walls or boundaries its definitely an owlcat game but thats not a bad thing just if you played any of their previous games you know what your getting into the characters seem to be cool and individuals i particularly like the psycher shes insane and it shows if the character creation isnt the greatest the backstory for your character makes up for it in allowing you to flesh out your character what world did he come from what did he do and of course the dreaded bad thing i was tortured and now i have anxiety around crowds i dont carouse as well as i used to there are archetypes and as you play you branch out into 4 different other classes which ones depend on your starting class it works well the bottom line the game is good enough especially if your really into wh40k which i am so its pretty damn good to me even if it isnt something ground breaking but then again how many ground breaking games come out starfield sure as wasnt it bg3 thats it cyberpunk too the witcher but not all games have to do that thankfully or we d be pretty bored there would be no break out games if not for the bad to mediocre games that exist so yeah its good enough if your into rts rpg games and especially if your familiar with wh40k lore youll most likely dig it but if you like fast action dont like to read your games there s lots and lots of reading than youll probably want to pass on this oh and i should thank either steam or owlcat for fixing my game finally i dunno who did it but thanks either way
