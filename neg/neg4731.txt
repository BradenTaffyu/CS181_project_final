2019 i love this game its a million times better then most of the tt apps out there however today i was trying to get a game going but after several errors in chat saying i had no nick i was a bit put off finally i was able to chat again and i commented on the mass of bans for trolling going up it was a simple comment about agreeing with modding chats but that it seemed excessive i was asked if i had read the rules and after responding that i didn t see how me knowing the rules had anything to do with me not being able to chat or that there were like 10 bans a sec going out and a mod name coyote responded by banning me from chat you need better moderators
