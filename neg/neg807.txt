2017 this used to be one of my favorite games i have bought and played all fallout versions but i am about to not give it a recommendation based solely on what bethesda has chosen to do with this game a short while ago bethesda added a new dlc called creator club this is a large increase of disk space and you are now forced to download it if you own the fallout 4 game and have it installed it does not even matter if you plan on playing it it costs a lot extra to play it or not you still have to clog up your hard drive with this add on and the problem is not just that it is always downloading more and more content to your hard drive which takes up bandwidth on your own home network so all of your steam games now run slower during downloads and they are putting so much effort in to this new dlc that it is always downloading something every day i am strongly considering un installing this game and all of the hours i have put in to it just to get my computer back if you have limited disk space or do not have a large and fast internet connection then your computer will be bogged down by a game that you will probably never even use i can t believe i am taking my time to write this even the creator club also appears to be attached to my skyrim game too all of these problems are just about the greed for more money by a software giant bethesda
