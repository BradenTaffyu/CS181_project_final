2023 2nd edit game is still in a death spiral the game director is stubborn on his changes that are very unpopular with the community wouldn t be surprised if the game gets removed from storefronts a few months after the last dlc comes outedit the october 5th patch is still miaa prime example of online only games being a bad idea servers don t work and there s no back up plan so it s unplayable the few times i got to play were good but it s been a total of maybe 5 or 6 games
