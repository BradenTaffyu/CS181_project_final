2022 early access review final update this is by far the worst game i have ever played on steam it s not even closedon t even bother trying it just avoid at all costs 1000000 10 ah marvel snap where do i even begin with this review i first heard about this game watching the angry joe show and it looked surprisingly fun but as someone who never games on his phone all i thought was how it s a shame i ll never get to try itlittle did i know that the game was on pc as well something i discovered a few days later while browsing my steam discovery queue so i downloaded it played a few matches kept winning kept getting tons of new cards and fell in love with the upgrading system upgrading cards changes their look and makes them a lot cooler the matches were fun and i simply could not stop playing and all i thought was how marvel snap was one of the best games i ever played in recent memorybut boy oh boy how wrong i was lets start with the good the game is amazing when you re just starting out still in pool 1 2 you constantly get new cards you re winning at a healthy rate you don t have to worry about any pay to win elements the matchmaking system is fine do keep in mind these only apply to when you re still new almost all of them change for the worse later on the gameplay itself is super fun addicting easy to learn but hard to master and only gets better the more cards you get cool art style also full of interesting characters upgrading cards is pretty satisfying for the most part every time you upgrade one it gains a new effect frame break 3d animated shiny logo animated borders infinity borders the deck building aspect is so fun mostly when you re still new it does get a lot worse when you enter pool 3 as you ll be forced to copy the meta decks or simply lose but it s still one of the things i enjoy the most in the game so i ll still count it as a the matches are short sweet you always feel like you want to play just one more match the so so once you upgrade a card to infinity you can split it to gain a new copy of it with some new effects like the rainbow backgrounds which i was never a fan of since they remove all the details in the original background and they never looked that good to begin with imo there are some amazing splits of course mainly the gold and inkified versions but they re so hard to obtain and you ll end up with a lot of similar looking boring splits along the way that you can t scrap or trade for something better locations are mostly fine they re there to keep matches fresh by always introducing something new for both players to play around and overcome however the devs keep introducing locations that stop you from playing the game by either replacing your deck with completely random cards or taking control and playing your cards for you which isn t fun for either parties stop it with the terrible locations get some helpnow to the bad the game claims to have no p2w elements but that s a lie there used to be 2 super broken cards that you could only obtain by paying for the season pass these 2 cards wrecked havoc in the game for months silver surfer zabu speaking of which the devs lock a new card every month behind a paid season pass those cards are often good to borderline broken and their argument is all cards will eventually be obtained by everyone else months later it takes at least 5 months for a season pass card to go from pool 5 to pool 3 there are other p2w elements but i m not even gonna bother paying to fast progress your collection and obtain more pool 4 5 cards they often release broken cards that fully dominate the meta but take months to nerf them so you often find yourself facing the same 2 3 broken decks over and over and over which is 100 killing the game and led many to completely stop playing all together when the devs decide to finally adjust the broken cards they often miss the mark by either completely killing cards that aren t even the main culprit lockjaw is the newest victim may he rest in peace not nerfing them nearly enough looking at you shuri they let a single card dominate for 3 seasons and only nerfed it once it dropped to the general population great move sd they also don t do nearly enough buffing the game is full of unusable cards bugs bugs and even more bugs they keep releasing cards that fully break the game and kick you from matches kang sentry kitty pryde the latest patch makes any card with a special animation fully crash the pc client for many people the matchmaking system is completely and utterly garbage you used to be able to face people at infinite past rank 100 while you re at rank 50 for context once you reach infinite you can t drop below it meanwhile anyone under can absolutely fall in rank so you often had to face people with nothing to lose who snap aggressively snapping wagering more ranked points aka cubes they did change it so you could only face people with 30 ranks difference which is still bad and only 2 days ago decided to finally stop infinite players from facing non infinite playersregardless of all this the matchmaking algorithm itself is garbage since its not based on rank but rather on some hidden mmr score it doesn t take into account your collection level so you ll often face people with cards you won t have for months if not longer nobody likes this system and yet they still haven t done anything to fix it pixel variants titles avatars you ll know what i mean once you play the game the predatory monetization 100 for some credits worthless boosters snap might be one of the most expensive ccgs out there period they also love to lock cool variants behind paid bundles bundles they claim won t be rereleased ever again further feeding on people s fomo almost no agency over your collection since acquiring new cards is completely random and based on lootboxes collector s caches reserves no real unranked mode you can t risk experimenting playing dumb fun decks at high levels or you ll risk tanking your rank the experience beyond infinite rank isn t all that good either i was led to believe reaching infinite is the true hidden unranked mode which is kinda true since you can t fall under 100 no matter how many times you lose but i didn t really have fun with it with the terrible matchmaking the stale shuri meta it was just meh but hey at least you can experiment with new cards decks without worrying once you get there this might be a sign i should just quit the game since even the unranked mode didn t make me enjoy it also reaching infinite is no easy feat only very few do so its not an option for the vast majority pool 5 was a mistake all new cards go to pool 5 and gradually drop months later except for a few perma pool 5 cards like thanos galactus you have a 0 25 chance of acquiring one from a collector s reserve i ve been playing since october for literally every single day and i ve yet to unlock a single one from a cache or a reserve so the majority of the general player base won t be able to experience any of the new releases for months awesome once you re pool 3 complete your progress is grinded to a halt you ll basically only get 1 new card per month from reserves so be prepared for that all in all there are probably many more negatives i forgot to mention my advice to you is to enjoy the early game and never get too attached to the point you can t quit because you invested too much time or moneyi stopped enjoying the game at least 3 months ago but i ve simply invested too much time to leave it all behind but alas i ve been playing it less and less and i m at the point i m basically forcing myself to launch it to do my dailies to just not fall too much behind so hopefully i can fully stop playing this piece of garbage soon
