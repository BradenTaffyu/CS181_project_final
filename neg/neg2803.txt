2016 when you start stellaris and play it for a couple of hours it s all wonderful the exploration and early settlement are possible the best you will find in any 4x game even the combat and wars are decent and more enjoyable than most other paradox games ship design is easy but with enough nuance even the none linear research has its charm however it s soon starts to fall apart here is the secret the game isn t done yet it s an early access title all but in name after those couple of magic hours everything starts to fall apart the second half of the game isn t balanced game features are minimalistic or outright bugged victory conditions are a joke the type that will make you shed tears of hopelessness and despair and the interface is absolutely not up to the task of managing a large empire at some point i found myself just grind for new planets not even realizing that for the last 10 hours i had finished all the research options and the remaining 12 choices where on a loop after playing the game for 44 hours i m left wondering if the developers only play tested the first 3 hours of the game paradox please do right by stellaris and give us a game that fun from beginning to end gorgeous graphics and ui nonlinear research lots of event great customization of races and ships mod support moo like with a touch of paradox and galactic civilzations unbalanced mid to late game is a grind feast events are strongly tight to planet colonization diplomacy event after the 1 21 patch isn t really engaging or functional ui becomes an obstacle to manage a large empire which isn t optional victory conditions are simplistic governors to limited and inflexible but again mandatory for victory end game event don t even end the game
