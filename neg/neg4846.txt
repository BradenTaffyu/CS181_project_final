2017 i ve played this for 11 hours and at times this game is really fun and rewarding but other times its just frustrating and not frustrating in the way of oh this game is hard but frustrating in the way of the game mechanics are actively just out to sabotage for the player because the ai isn t smart enough to actually present a challenge what are my griefs about this game loyalty what is loyalty in this game how do we improve it there s no feed back i get pop ups that my generals are lacking in loyalty so i send them raiding and conquering for a few turns in a row pop up dissapears for 2 turns and comes back again why why is their loyalty low they ve conquered 2 cities and won 5 battles siege they have done nothing to improve the lack of a proper siege system or siege battles they still suck as they did in warhammer 1 skaven the skaven are very difficult to play you re the only faction in the game that relies on food and you cannot produce it in any great numbers the only way you can get food production in every province is to enact a province decree which makes you break even or to do a ritual which gives you 1 measly food in exchange for your currency you consume food to keep your skaven under empire from collapsing in on itself and to capture cities which means that every time you a capture a level 6 city it will be level 1 2 instead the level 6 that any other nation would capture it s virtually impossible to keep a general loyal as the skaven yes this is technically accurate however in the wider scope of the game it means that it s excedingly difficult to have more than 1 army as the entire army will defect with the general meaning that your veteran highly equipped units will switch to the rebel side that spells f u n for you rituals the rituals mechanic in itself is pretty cool but was it even playtested in my current play through i am playing as the high elves in ulthuan i have almost re unified all of my island and i sit down to do the 2nd ritual i have 4 full stack armies 2 in the north 2 in the south guarding my ritual centers so what happens 2 norsca armies invade from the north3 chaos stacks spawn in the middle of my island raising 3 cities in their first turn2 dark elf intervention stacks spawn in the south near my capital quickly raising 2 cities and laying siege to one of my armies in my captial2 chaos like armies spawn in ships south of my capital sailing straight for my other ritual site lets evaluate the odds of what i am going up against wiht my 4 stack army i have 4 stacks i am fighting 9 stacks so i am ridiciously outnumbered i also lost 5 cities 3 major cities now i have public order issues in my remaining cities rebellion stacks soon to spawn as well as my income for my 4 armies is now in the negative meaning that my armies suffer attrition and public order goes up everywhere how is this a fun mechanic how can the ai spawn 5 stacks smack dab in the middle of your empire next to undefended cities why don t intervention forces spawn outside your border and marching in how is it feasible in the lore for 15 000 dark elves to spawn at the center of ulthuan and nobody bats an eye what is the point of the ultuan gates if the ai spawns inside them 4 inches away to your capital this game is badly in need of rebalancing and even more so in need of the modding community to fix that the dev s clearly did not game test i am definitely down for a challenge but then make the ai challenging don t make it spawn 7 armies inside of my bloody defensive gates whats the point of them now i should also add this game will be amazing when they come out with the warhammer 1 merge and remove the broken ritual mechanics that is where this game will shine but until that point honestly stay away it is not worth the price that they charge for it at full price save yourself from aggrevation and come back to the game when it s ready and desgined as it was meant to be in unison with warhammer i
