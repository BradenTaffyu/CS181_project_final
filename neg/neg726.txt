2019 this game just doesn t have the style and soul that i loved about the older games in the series i think it looses the world in trying to create the factions and endless quests that they thought would keep players playing but really just made every player hate those meaningless kill fetch or both quests don t get me going on them destroying the modding community and corrupting the freedom that we once had for our own games update as of the end of 2019 i still dislike this game i have over 200 hours trying to like this game i want too i want to love it all bethesda all we as loyal fans want is you to release a big not massive really single player open world game that s full of character full of story and not light on under the surface detail it doesn t need to be a polished masterpiece you could even be honest about that just let the it be modded freely
