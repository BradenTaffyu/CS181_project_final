2020 i truly wish there was a neutral rating unfortunately at the end of the day the negatives grossly outweigh the positives the game itself is fun and though not completely historically accurate see other reviewers it does peak your interest in naval warfare history controls are easy to pick up and the short nature of the strategic matches makes it easy to jump into a game for 10 minutes and be done it s quite a positive for busy schedules it also has an adult community and i haven t yet experienced the toxic community that are evident in many games that being said there are plenty negatives for one the grind is mind numbing yes it s ftp but if you don t have a premium account the grind redefines tedious even with the premium account the game is a chore and the amount of experience points needed to research the next level ship gets ridiculous the developers also feel the need to entice you with new ships occasionally but only start you out with 5 tokens and the cost is somewhere around 200 tokens starting the killer though is the price structure when ships can cost 70 100 you either have to be filthy rich swiping daddy s credit card without his knowledge or having a manic episode if it s the latter i hope you seek some help and have someone monitor your game play because these developers have structured this game such that you seriously have the potential to become homeless from not paying your bills 100 for a digital ship seriously who pays this while i ll likely hop on for a game or two here and there i won t be sinking any into it and i can t in good conscience recommend this game
