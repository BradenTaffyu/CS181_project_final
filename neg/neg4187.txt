2019 okay it s time for this i must recognize that i have low hours compared to a lot of hardcore players i also have high hours compared to most negative reviews about negligible stuff like too hard to play when they have 5 hours or a plain trash no this is hopefully a concise however complete review of this game okay first off i have a love hate relationship with this game but i generally lean toward love i have had great times with and without friends and that i will never forget this game has an extremely interesting community in that you can find literally anything meaning and very nice people generally pretty polarized in these two groups remember this that aside let s get into why i gave this game a negative review this game has seen a lot of opportunity for improvement it s been in development for ever and yet the best content generally comes from mods made by private communities an envyable modder community for that matter basic i mean basic stuff that a so called military simulator should have are lacking hell i m not asking for the moon when i expect planes to turn when i bank to either side the ai can be extremely annoying to work with especially with zeus although zeus games are really fun if they play out well the game barely has a jumping mechanic not to mention the army of bugs desyncs etc basically continuing on the previous point this game has seen a disapointing amount of optimization given its age i have what most people would consider a good computer running most modern games full ultra relatively well but arma will still give me lag spikes if playing in full ultra so i just stick to high settings if you are not careful you can stumble on one of the most toxic tacticool communities out there like the ones in airsoft teams especially if you are looking for an arma 3 clan be weary of this at the same time clans and gaming communities can be your very best experience in this game i have the luck to be in one of them not before going through some of the first ones though related to the new dlc i haven t read much about it but i find that it says a lot about the game devs when they release a alien dlc that probably no one asked for when there are so many things that could be fixed and added but are intead neglected and left to modders to kinda fix through patch mods or just content mods in general pricing and general dlc policy of bohemia is also very trashy and ea style just a bit better can it be worse tho generally this game has given me some of the best times in my life and i continue to enjoy it from time to time i come back to it like a beaten dog goes back to its abusing owner i m dramatizing but sometimes it be feeling like that lol i recommend you buy it on a sale all dlcs are not worth half what they charge you so definitely buy them on sales finally i hope you find this useful if you are like me you will love this game despite its defects otherise big nono
