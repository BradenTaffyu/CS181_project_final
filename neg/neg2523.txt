2018 i played this game alot but there isn t enough animals and they keep adding packs as dlc which should have been in the game in the first place i kept buying in and just stopped that now it is important to know the new dlc does not include the big 5 elephants rhinos or other also hunting geese is only possible with dlc the game is bugged and the company works on making dlc s instead of fixing and optimizing the game or at least adding more animals there is soooooo few species of animals and almost no big ones my 2 other friends stopped playing after both got their progress reset in the bug some time backsave yourself time and money and don t buy in ultil they fix the game tl dr pros beautiful landscapes nice tracking system fine shooting mechanics cons bugged af on several pc s way to many dlc packs that should have been free too few animals easy way out of every single animation opening a door gives me a stroke ffs also animals have a habit of just teleporting the away if they get stuck good luck tracking that
