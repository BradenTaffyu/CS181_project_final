2021 let me start off with this this game is amazing its a great star wars rpg mmo the story s you experience in each class is unique and brings something special to the table and i adore it when it comes down to gameplay you can play it like a singe player rpg or of course with your buddies taking on quests and fates and just explore these big areas which are still breathtaking for a game made in 2011 if you play solo like me you can get a handful of companions to accompany you on your journey with some companions like kira you don t have to worry about dying she makes you almost invincible unless you go out of your way to screw up royally the combat is super fun and your skill tree is really cool letting you obtain new ability s like in kotor with a skill tree i recommend this game wholeheartedly but why did i give it a negative review well i recently just started playing it again and it reminded me why i stopped you see i first started playing it with the original launcher from the swotor website and had a great time never any issues logging in but once it got to steam i was excited now i can officially add it to my library on steam but that s the problem it seems like steam takes poor control on updating the launcher leaving me with this message when i log in error launcher not up to date with game server log out and try again so i validate the files its a fix for a few hours till i log off and continue with my real life then ill log on again to play boom hits me with the message again or ill log off go to bed go to work get home then there is that message again it does not stop then re validate the files but some times that dosen t work for whatever reason then im suck here stumped i go to bioware s site for a fix and since steam uses a streaming launcher there really is no fix for it you can uninstall visual c 2015 2019 then have the launcher reinstall it or just uninstall it and reinstall the whole game but does not work for me unless someone wants to reach out to help me fix this ill change my negative review to a positive one because i literately have nothing but good things so say about the game its self so if you want to play this i would recommend getting the game from the swotor site may the force be with you always
