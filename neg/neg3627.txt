2020 early access review with the release of alpha 19s loot progression i just cannot recommend this game anymore which is sad because it was such a decent game its absolute garbage and makes 0 sense now what this change was supposed to do is slow the accumulation of higher level more end game loot too early making the game feel more progressive which i fully support if it had been done correctly and more realistically what it actually did was make the game feel monotonous and incredibly unrealistic basically what this did was make it impossible to find anything useful until you level up 12 levels or more some daring exploration used to reward the benefits of finding a lvl 1 pistol or double barrel in the first few days increasing your chances of survival now you can fight your way through hordes of zombies to a building with a gun safe in it spend 15 minutes whacking away at it with your stone axe all to be rewarded with your 20th bunderbluss another stone axe and stone spear because this is literally all the world is capable of giving you until you level up open 1000 safes get 1000 garbage items it strip away the excitement of opening a chest this is unbearable for a loot heavy survival game it makes exploring for chests safes and military caches completely pointless until you have monotonously bashed in 100s of zombies brains with a wood club or other primitive weapon to level up to where the world will now spawn a pistol or what used to be considered other starting weapons such as a double barrel shotgun i realize this is a game and not real life but common this is just plain dumb and so unrealistic it also used to be possible to find parts for or build a bicycle in the first few days now you cant simply put they created a completely fake world that resembles a strategy game stone age iron age steel age technology age which is incredibly slow and monotonous to progress through especially with default game settings i appreciate the attempt to slow the progression down but it was just taken way too far the only way to play this game right now is to add mods which fix this horrible looting item progression system im happy to change this review back to a positive when the developers rework this broken progression system
