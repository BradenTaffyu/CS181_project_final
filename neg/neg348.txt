early access review this game used to be one the best games on steam now it is pure cancer do not recommend anyone to play this game in 2024 maybe it will get better one day but i doubt it community of this game is so delusional that they actually defend this game against every negative post and review just compare negative and positive reviews about this game nearly every negative one is a eleborate while nearly every positive is just random words or 1 sentence review here is a grim reality game is not fun anymore you will loot for 2 3hrs then u will be killed by some new awesome glitch or server crash and lose all the progress pre teaming is super common in this game streamers get free legendary loot on the market also 95 of the time you will do pve and btw it is the real challenge in this game for new players and u need to spend good amount of time to learn how to fight npcs in dark and darker and let s not talk about in game balance because it is pretty hard to balance games like that however if u can play like 5 6 hrs every day then your grind can pay off and u might have some fun in this game nothing even close to 2023 amount of fun but still something right also be prepared for crazy surprises from amazing dev team they ve lost their sanity due to the lawsuit
