2019 it s very cute i like the graphics and the humor in the disease names it could be a good game but it feels incomplete and more like a mobile game than a pc game my key criticisms are while laying out rooms you can only add one door to a room there are a lot of layouts where i d wish i could have multiple points of entry especially with breakrooms the minimal sizes for the rooms is also a bit peculiar as i have some rather spartan rooms without much else to put in them i fit in its necessities in a far smaller space than is required for the room itself and patients seem plenty happy with those tiny level 1 rooms people don t seem to get called to the next available room rather they queue for one specific room if you add an addition room new queues will grow for that room but your original queue remains people don t switch over it s like the old system of having multiple checkouts at a grocery store instead of a single feeder line into multiple checkouts there s no sense of triage or priority that guy can die waiting in line while my staff attend other people who are fine you have to manually bump up priority for almost dead people but by the time the game warns you they re already very nearly dead job prioritization generally is lacking i can set which jobs people can do but that s it there isn t cover the gp office is your top priority but if things are good there then go be a psychiatrist i d much prefer how rimworld handles it you can do it this way or you can do it in a numerical 1st priority 2nd priority etc way game settings like fast treat or auto promote need to get toggled back on every time a minor pet peeve in that i have to reopen that settings window every time i start a new hospital when i d otherwise have been able to set forget it just once sometimes i really wish there was a faster than fast game speed especially when the last challenge is something like do research but my doctors aren t prioritizing actually doing any research other than for small snippets at a time
