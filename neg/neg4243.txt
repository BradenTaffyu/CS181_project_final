2018 early access review i really love this game but little things always drive me crazy and push me away i ll circle back to it a few more times when it receives patches especially once it gets officially released and maybe give it a thumbs up priority becoming sub priority killed me a little three duplicants somehow get all their heads stuck in the same floor tile and are dying so i set the deconstruct task to the tile for 9 the remaining dupe runs around doing other chores instead since she s a miner she would rather dig any existing dig order on the map than perform a life saving priority 9 task so i have to go cancel all of those i know i can also go edit her individual priorities temporarily to fix that problem but in any case i feel like job individual priority and sub priority have this convoluted relationship that prevents rather than enables things from happening smoothly or organically maybe a month ago i had just built a cot for a dupe and instead of sleep in it they wander down to a pit full of water with a ladder in it and sleep hanging from the ladder underwater and eventually wake up suffocating what is going on with this ai yes eventually they ll auto assign themselves to beds or i can do it manually but at some point the game needs to decide whether i have to micromanage everything and thus make it as smooth as possible to do so or if i m supposed to be able to sit back and oversee everything in which case they need to stop trying to kill themselves so often and ignoring critical situations for days permanently what really got me this time though is a longstanding problem where a building is set to handle materials like picking what types and subtypes will go into a storage unit or which liquids a bottler emptier will use if a material hasn t been encountered yet it doesn t show up on the list and is unselectable that s fine in a sense it keeps things simpler but this means you can t select just the single material you have exposure to by selecting the only item currently on a list you are in fact selecting all future items no matter what you do this means that when i make a bottle emptier and try and just do water i am weeks later also doing polluted water unless i remember to deselect something i never originally selected otherwise i end up dumping polluted water into my clean water supply and contaminating it this means i either need to revert my save and redo the situation or just walk away for awhile so i don t go crazy i don t regret my purchase since i ve had fun learning and tinkering with the game over the course of its development but i can t really recommend right now because it s getting more annoying than fun like i said i ll swoop back and give it another chance down the road but if i run into the above issues or similar ones again i can t say i ll be inclined to recommend
