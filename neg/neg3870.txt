2020 early access review so yeah i got about 750 hours into the game before i can say that i do not enjoy it for reference i am playing this on an unmodded version as i feel like that is what the developers put out and anyone saying it s better with mods doesn t make the product the fp have put out any better so how did i put this much time in a game i do not enjoy because my non enjoyment is based on the overall experience rather than the various components taken each individually and looking at them in the way they were meant then yes it s a lot of fun i enjoy the zombie survival i enjoy the base building component as well as the various weapons that we can both find and make the seventh night during which the zombies come screaming towards you and you have to pray that you did your job in preparing while fighting them off screaming yourself provides for many laughs guns have a satisfying feel to them with different options for different scenarios and there are times when after you finish clearing out a horde with your shotgun smoking or make that perfect shot knocking a bird out of the sky makes you feel fantastic however in a weird way this game is the opposite when you say that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts it is made of the zombie survival is fun except that either you are running around never coming across any opposition and your pockets bursting with food water and medicine or you are chased down by a never ending ever swelling horde while throwing the lint from your empty pockets at them in defense and speaking of defending ourselves the weapons are varied but it took them to a19 to introduce scrap axes and a18 to include spears something so basic that we come with it as children when we used to play outside we are surviving making a spear is survival basics 101 even more so than making a bow and arrow the base building man i love the base building but it seems that with every new update we go backwards in our options i think i started playing this in alpha 16 and we had more options for paint as well as more interesting decorating options to buy and use than we do now so not only are we not given more things to use to make bases our own the fp updates seem to actively take our options away when it comes to making our own designs when building that base is what this game seems to be about like i said the combat in the game has its great moments and there have been improvements for people who might want to do more melee with the inclusion of wraps and various knuckle covers but these moments where you feel like a badass are not just fleeting they are minimal the ai of the zombies also fluctuates between hyper intelligence especially for rotting corpses to the intelligence of actual corpses they know exactly where the weakest point in your base is can calculate the fastest way to you including if it is faster to dig through the ground to do so but also are incapable of seeing you if you sneak in and crouch right in front of their open eyes while you do and do not react when another zombie falls screaming to the ground as you put a bolt between its eyes i am going to continue playing this game and i m not actively going to tell people not to buy it but you know maybe shop around a little or get it on sale check out the modding community which after i m done writing i ll do if you already have the game but for the base game i hope they turn it around and get this game to their dream state as this was very clearly designed you don t work this long on a game without being passionate about doing it
