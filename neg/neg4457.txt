2020 note i purchased and am reviewing the platinum edition of civ 6 the opinion here is about the base game the rise and fall and gathering storm expansions i absolutely do not recommend buying the base game at full price just like civ 5 civ 6 without any expansions is a playable but intentionally crude early and unfinished game lacking features that would be added later as paid expansions it is a rip off thankfully it looks like people have caught on and likely explains why regular civ 6 keeps going on sale for 15 before anything else if you re a huge fan of civ i d recommend trying before buying civ 6 is so different and such a huge departure from the standard civ formula you might not like it the new district system will either make or break the game for you additionally wonders now consume city tiles so you can t stuff them all into 1 city anymore as for my personal feelings after playing for 50 hours i absolutely want to recommend civ 6 it grew on me a bit to the point i like it but its very flawed and i can t for the following reasons the ui user interface is confusing and takes a lot of getting used to its lacking and just terrible in some places this is the first civ game where clicking on one of your own cities doesn t bring up a city window telling you everything you want to know buttons appear in the lower right corner of the screen instead certain civ screens are missing or hidden military is a huge one i thought there was no way to find individual units until i noticed clicking on the unit name in the lower right opens a tab showing all your units i learned this by accident after about 40 hours of play another thing i learned by accident was finding out quests was a clickable button on a city state screen baffling design choice given quests aren t complicated and can simply just be shown on the city state report another glaring problem is information on luxury resources just like 5 luxury resources are important for your cities happiness but unless i haven t found it yet the only way you can tell which ones you have is by trading with another civ and even then there s no way to tell the lux s you ve currently got from trades afaik strategic resources civ 6 has decided to treat strategy resources like currency stockpiling them and spending them to build units or buildings this is fine but this changes once you hit coal coal being a fuel gets consumed 1 per turn for whatever uses it which again is fine but strat resources are rare yield 2 3 per turn and can t maintain much if you re lucky to have 1 there are no buildings that produce or increase a strat resources yield then you hit oil and things become stupid dumb and bad almost every late game unit requires a fuel resource a tank using oil makes total sense but infantry you know them the basic military unit you build when you have no resource they require 1 oil per turn in civ 6 what why are they drinking it mechanized infantry does too when it didn t before as if a lead designer pointed at the unit and said duh that s a car car oil aluminum is profoundly idiotic i would think you d accumulate 20 aluminum to build a helicopter no helicopters need 1 aluminum per turn like its fuel what planet did the people who made this game come from military late game is a disaster you can hardly produce any units thanks to resource restriction how could they screw up the resource system so bad in this game its inexcusable climate change ecological fallout from pollution is not new to the civ games and it should be part of the series there are real life consequences from treating your home like a toilet or garbage dump after all what bothers me with civ 6 is this appears to be there because of real life politics from alarmist faux environmentalist hipsters its just co2 pollution from fossil fuels its highly exaggerated there are techs and buildings present in earlier games that are not present here just to push this making energy co2 co2 is the devil agenda this extends to nuclear power which civ 6 believes produces co2 for some unknown reason reality check nuclear produces 0 air pollution irl but it does produce radioactive waste and hey whaddaya know there s no concept or message of toxic solid or water pollution human poo poo and pee pee waste or recycling in this game at all funny that the clean energy like solar or wind farms are tile improvements and not buildings for some reason hydroelectric and related wonders like hoover and 3 gorges dam a clean energy source is also non existent government policy system this is the absolute worst thing about civ 6 and makes me want to tear my hair out there are a ton of government policy cards granting specific civ bonuses the government you have offers a few slots for these cards to make most efficient use of them you will be wasting a lot of time micromanaging these every time you discover civic its one of the really obnoxious parts of civ 6 that makes me appreciate how simple and straight forward civ 5 s social policy and government system were then there s the one part i m split between liking and hating new districting system i like it because it introduces a new strategy to the game but i hate it because you can t move a district if you build it in the wrong place and you can t destroy it if you want to replace it with a different one the districts are also severely limiting and slow city development down tremendously outside of placement bonuses districts provide a place to build specific buildings you can t just build a library anymore you need to build a campus science district first the thing i hate most about civ 6 though is the followingyoutube update videos its october 2020 the channel sid meier s civilization puts out a video on youtube about an upcoming free 1 update watching it i m reminded of beyond earth a game that is full of a lot of weird indian references and is a potentially good game ruined by confusing bad and dumb game design to the point i feel it should be called singh meierdeep s beyond earth since i know sid isn t indian and capable of better than this based on that october 2020 update video the source for civ 6 s confusing dumb and bad game design is easy to identify there s only one place people that insufferable and full of themselves could come from this game should be called reddit s civilization 6 seriously the self congratulatory smugness and narcissism oozing out of that video says a lot about civ vi s development team and who the game is made for an echo chamber based on everything above i can not recommend its a shame since there s a lot i like about civ 6 most of the game s assets are appealing and good the animated civ leaders are emotive and look fantastic civ 6 has gone back to animating wonder construction after they ve been built being a very different game from the rest of the series doesn t bother me i actually like some of the new takes and unfortunately civ 6 has the same problem beyond earth has there s a good game here brought down by genuinely bad and sometimes baffling design choices civ 6 s worst mistakes could easily be corrected by firaxis but i doubt they ever will you ll have to rely on mods i suppose my biggest criticism with civ 6 and the main reason i don t recommend is its not an improvement over the earlier games i would recommend both civ 4 beyond the sword and civ 5 which needs brave new world to be good over 6 these are simply better games with more competent design civ 4 beyond the sword still offers the best traditional civ experience civ 5 brave new world provides a simplified yet still engaging and challenging take on the game i ve left the comments open so you can call me a stupid dummy poo poo head and tell me how wrong i am
