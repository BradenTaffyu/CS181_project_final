2020 i played just under 200 hours so obviously i enjoyed this game a good long while and got my money s worth but no i don t recommend it the game is unfair in that a lot of the information you need is hidden to get very far you ll have to spend a lot of time reading wikis and watching other people play of course once you ve done that there s nothing left to do except implement solutions that others invented i quit this game for good after the following scenario my base was being overheated from the bottom my heat management in my base was ok but all the water underneath was turning to steam i guess there was a natural heat source down there i never found it i decided to make the best of it by building a steam turbine this required several real time hours get oil from slicksters refine oil to petroleum build polymer press refine petroleum to plastic build atmo suit station so my builders don t get scalded build steam turbine when i turned it on nothing happened i hadn t spent enough time reading wikis the steam turbine doesn t just run on any old steam no the steam must be a certain temperature and my steam was too cool why the devs don t include basic info like that in the game itself is beyond me
