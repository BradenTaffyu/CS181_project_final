i like the game good enough but bethesda lied to ban my main account after almost 4 years they used this lie to ban my account only 7 days after i purchased a year of fallout 1st and 30 for the pitt recruitment bundle they lied and stole 130 plus almost 4 years of grinding often miserable quests after figuring out what actually happened i did not violate their code of conduct like they lied to claim they would not lift a finger to attempt to replace what they stole the people making these immoral decisions to lie and steal will get what they deserve i absolutely have proof of their lies by backing up the game file before they changed it and screenshots of their support team s lies i recommend no games from bethesda a company that is willing to use lies to steal from paying customers does not deserve your business a moral company would do what it takes to correct their mistake
