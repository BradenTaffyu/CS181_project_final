2018 i want to love the game i really do i enjoyed ets but wanted to have that experience on my home continent the problem is despite the devs expressing interest in working on ats its been a year and a half and they ve only got the game up to 4 states the concept of the game is supposed to be at least the 48 continental states maybe working into mexico and canada in the long term at this rate the game wont be done until im dead the big draw for me with ats was that you d have at least the continental us to play in they re taking so long though that i ll no longer have interest by the time it comes out meanwhile i see either equal content or sometimes even more still coming for ets i imagine they have a bigger community and as well they should its got the whole continental european map at their disposal its just sad that a bigger focus hasnt been put on developing the ats map
