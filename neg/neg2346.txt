2022 tldr play it with friends and don t take the story seriously and it s a perfectly passable game with a charming aesthetic and fun decorations as far as survival crafting games go the core mechanics aren t bad and can be rather fun especially with friends however after finishing the story and exploring the majority of the upgrades available for the raft the game became very trivial none of the combat was challenging the survival aspect was near gone because of how easy it is to make a completely self sufficient raft and as much as i wanted to love this game with all of its charm i can t say i do without getting into too much detail or potential spoiler territory by the time i got to the final story based island i felt like i was finishing things out of obligation a chore i had to do rather than for enjoyment and with the time i had sunk into the game i didn t want to just give up at the end i had to see it through
