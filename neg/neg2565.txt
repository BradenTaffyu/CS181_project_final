2021 tldr was a great game and a great developer the developer s quality has fallen apart the game retains great potential if the developers can get their house in order at it s heart this was a great game and it retains that potential however the developers are clearly having some sort of issues interrupting the quality of their delivery pipeline until recently i was purchasing every dlc they released in support of them immediately upon release i even have some dlc i haven t even played yet the reason i stopped was the total collapse of their releases every new release both patches and new content introduce new bugs of a sever critical nature even worse for the last 4 or 5 new content releases the new content itself had major bugs preventing the enjoyment of that new content yes some bugs are expected with new releases but this game has taken it to a whole new level what s worse is it takes them months to correct these bugs it seems as though with each new release the development team introduces more bugs then they fix for now i m just waiting to see if the developers can get their house back in order and start putting out quality releases that i know they re capable of until then i will not be spending any more money on this title when it s new competitor releases in the near future i may just have to jump ship completely
