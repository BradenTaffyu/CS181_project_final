2023 early access review i ve played ark survival evolved for thousands of hours and have played this game long enough to know it isn t worth the 45 price tag the graphics are only really achievable with top of the line hardware the servers are not good enough to handle the traffic and there are not enough of them so basically consider buying this game as a single player experience currently and even in single player the game it not well optimized and just feels sluggish compared to ase old ark i wouldn t recommend yet as i think the game has great potential but isn t currently worth it unless you re a hardcore player who s dying for something new
