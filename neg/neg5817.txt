2014 broken game bad ai even on higher difficulties ai has been improved but is still weak horrible desynq from co op ui that randomly breaks and can force you to lose lots of campaign progress unless you save manually every turn because of message boxes that will not allow you to continue ai turns that can take forever fixed in sp and money grabbing dlc packs blood and gore add on seriously avoid update on 19 4 2016 ai still cannot play a combined land and naval siege all units get stuck when beaching leading to easy victories over impossible odds or an unwinnable fight against few weaks foes
