2023 i m going to try and keep this short and to the point this game s economy is the single worst example of a progression system in any video game on the market today i am not a f2p player i spent or rather tried to spend my nearly 200 hours in this game flying the harrier gr 1 and av 8a both of which are premium vehicles that cost as much as a full price game after spending my real money to fly what i was interested in flying my reward was finding out the repair cost of these vehicles meant that if i didn t perform extremely well in matches i was going to lose in game currency silver lions after only a few days my stockpile of sl was down from the millions to the tens of thousands i was being forced into buying a premium account or grinding low rank tanks something i was not interested in in order to continue repairing the premium vehicles i had purchased this is frankly unacceptable gaijin said in their recent statement that multiple revenue streams and ways for players to support the game is necessary for the game to continue and yet the repair costs actively strangle people at all levels of investment in an effort to squeeze out that little bit more from people already supporting them here is the point remove repair cost slow progression is one thing but seeing progress lost sl in this case just for playing poorly or for playing a vehicle with a low modifier will kill any motivation a player has this is simple game design people would rather receive things slowly than have things taken away even if the end result is the same amount of time for the same progression one final note balancing the vehicles frequency in games via their sl modifiers is ridiculous players should never be discouraged from playing what they want you have battle rating to balance effectiveness you do not need to use the economy to pressure people into using different vehicles bad snail bad
