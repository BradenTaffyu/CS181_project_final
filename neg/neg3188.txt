2018 edit warning review police fanboys not allowed comments will be deleted there s many good and bad aspects to wows i will try to highlight the ones i feel most important ultimately this game is not so unlike your typical shooter game you ve got two teams and an objective however unlike your typical fps style shooter there are no respawns here which is nice it forces people to play strategically unfortunately the maps are too small and the objectives rarely ever get completed and 98 times out of 100 you ll end up losing winning because your or their whole team died the good wows does a very good job of accurately depicting real wwii era warships from the smallest detail on the least known ships to the most important details on the legendary infamous ships like the missouri yamato and the enterprise graphically the ships and game world are very well detailed water splash effects from weapon fire and weapon fire smoke look fantastic watching a sinking ship has gotten me killed more than once so many ships from many different nations including usa britain france russia germany and more there is a sense of progression when it comes to ships working to unlock them can take quite a while especially if you re new and or don t want to spend real money pve and pvp modes the not so good pve mode while nice people are severely punished for not playing pvp as the rewards are greatly diminished i m not a hardcore player i like to hop on with a friend and play a match or two i do this casually so i typically play against bots however due to the progression system and severely diminishing rewards for doing pve i will never be able to progress to the higher tiers furthermore i m not willing to play enough and train enough to get good enough to play this competitively thus i would be nothing but a burden to my fellow teammates and an easy target to the enemy pve wont help you learn how to play against other players so i don t really understand the hardcore nerf to pve rewards they involve two very different styles of gameplay the problem is one is rewarding and one is not furthermore the rewards for doing well and winning in a pve match are actually less than doing bad and losing in a pvp match pay to win this is a touchy subject this game is hugely based on skill however there is an underlying rng system that will affect your gameplay and no matter how good you are that rng can screw you over the extremely pathetically obvious greedy priced premium ships can give people an advanatge over other people due to seemingly better rng results but not enough to force everyone into a premium ship greed it s bad like really bad you thought ea was bad you haven t seen anything yet the premium ships in this game can cost well over 30 40 usd and some selling for 80 or more they use typical greed tactics like price a ship at 140 then discount it to 100 and say you re getting a great deal and it s limited time only there s an optional subscription that will run you a bit less than your typical subscription costs for other subscription based games except the reward for paying a monthly fee is hardly worth it want to demount a ship upgrade spend real money need an extra ship slot spend real money want to retrain a captain spend real money want to convert xp to fxp so you can spend it on whatever ship you like spend real money want to use consumables to give you an advantage they re free but you can get better ones with real money want to permanently unlock a ship skin spend real money want legendary wwii warships spend lots of real money it s just so much greed and where there isn t greed there is hardcore grind and if you choose to do that grind in pve it will take you 10 times longer overall gameplay is horribly unbalanced there s 10 tiers of ships with each tier getting progressively more powerful you can be in a ship with 35 000 health that does an average of 5 000 damage per volley and in the same match be facing off against someone with a ship that has more than 90 000 health and can completely destroy your ship with a single volley from the other side of the map this is where the skill comes in not to mention if you re in a tier 8 ship you can still be matched up against people in a tier 10 ship in fact once i was in a tier 7 ship and ended up facing off agianst an almost entire team of tier 10 s it didn t take long for me to end up back at base ultimately the imbalance cause the need for skill you can work around that imbalance but you need a lot of battles under your belt for the proper amount of experience it s a long trip to get that good my advice play it it s free it s a fun game but for the love of games please don t pour money into these people s pockets this is the problem with the gaming industry it s too much about money and not enough about the game unless you re really hardcore into competitive pvp games i d recommend only playing this casually if you don t have the time to put in to get good you ll only cause yourself grief
