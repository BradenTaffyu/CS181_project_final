2020 early access review the east asia multiplayer servers are moderated by a chinese group who encourage any anti ccp sentiment to be reported offenders are then banned not just on the east asia servers but every other server too meaning this censorship is present in the entire multiplayer game a friend of mine was banned from the game s steam forum for mentioning taiwan let me make it clear taleworlds the scummy developers of this game are responsible for censorship of anything that goes against the ccp and prc instead of just having a dedicated multiplayer server for citizens of the prc everyone else in the game has to be subject to the ccp s vile censorship tw are putting their chinese market before everyone else to the detriment of everyone else aside from that the game is overall poor the singleplayer in my opinion doesn t add enough to be considered a sequel to warband it is essentially a mod with a new engine the vast majority of the features that are new were already present in warband mods if you got burned out of the warband singleplayer experience you will find that bannerlord bores you just as warband does i speak as someone with 2000 hours in warband mostly singleplayer taleworlds have been developing this for 8 years getting subsidised by the turkish government and all they ve done is retcon warband lore and make what feels like a fancy warband mod it s also disgusting that taleworlds are charging the price for the early access game that they re going to charge for the full game if you re not desperate to play this game then wait for the full release or wait for it to go on sale is this glorified warband full conversion mod worth 40 no even if taleworld s suppression of freedom of speech doesn t bother you maybe it doesn t maybe you play plenty of games that have similar censorship then bare in mind that this game overall is quite poor if you are new to the mount blade concept then you ll love it if you got bored with warband you ll be no more interested in bannerlord
