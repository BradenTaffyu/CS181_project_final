2023 oh boi this is a tough decision i m going to do here i for one are sad its a great game i can stand by that i loved it through every hour i played of this i bought it back in the days when it came out for 13 euros early access i loved it it was already finished by then i remembered ofc we still needed some content and it sure came in the base game for 20 euros at that time of release it was worth the money i could sure back that back there when it came out that a dlc was in the working i jumped on the train straight to royalty x x and i loved that dlc a lot they putted out a banger by adding imperials with a new ending which was amazing at the time of the release i think it was 18 euros which i felt was a little overpriced since the base game were 20 euros but it was 25 now what i want to clear out here is that i loved royalty as well the coming dlcs but i felt at that point it was on a runway straight to the top and rightfully so because it is a good game and was still worth those 25 euros but 45 euros at that point started to be expensive if i were going to buy it for my brother tho i just hold tight to it came on offer but it never came better than 20 i think here is where i started to kinda wonder if this is the right road for a game like this because sure here is mods and you can play the game with some mods but not a full packet without the other dlcs and so came religion dlc another dlc i was excited for and we can talk about that it came out for 20 euros as well which is fine for a dlc like that it added a whole butt ton like 2 new endings a completely new mechanic that game changed the game to suddenly be more inventive i loved how creative you could be with it like making your own religion by that adding another survival aspect of it i struggled really hard with ranchers but that is the gift of it new roles for colonists also made it more tactical by you choosing tamers that has a bigger chance of taming a pet this dlc was better than royalty since it added a lot more you now have more creation to do and that was great 20 euros i would gladly pay for it but now we in a danger zone which again i will point out this is starting to be really expensive almost 60 euros to enjoy a good game like this by that i feel you started to betray fan base again ive been a supporter since early release but at that point i thought this is about to break down your gonna get less players and less fans who would love this game by that also hitting where it hurts on people their money i still haven t bought this game for my brother and now probably never gonna buy it for him since the price is hitting a boundary where no normal player would have the money for it other than if they start saving money up for it when i heard that a new dlc would be created biotech s i was troubled because i m sure its a good dlc i just haven t had the money to buy it and try it and sadly i don t think i will 23 euros is expensive and ofc if i saved some money up for it i could hit the game again and enjoy it but that doesn t change that your price on the game and dlcs are rocking up at 91 5 euros this is by far to expensive and here is where i finally decided to open up my voice i fear that you are basically trying to milk its last days because you ain t getting any new followers or buyers of this game i say that because when my brother finally soo how much the base game costed now he said don t buy it its not worth it this was the final straw for me a huge fan since early release big fan of what you made of what you created but now finally opening my eyes towards what this is about to become what the future holds for the game i loved rimworld
