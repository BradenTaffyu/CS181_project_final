2021 despite loving the civ series i can t recommend civ vi it has some good ideas and the modding scene is greatly improved from v to the point that it s possible to nearly recreate the rhye s and fall mod unfortunately it s also more unstable than any other civ i ve played especially on larger map sizes iv isn t stable anymore either but that game is nearly 15 years old comparing that to a four year old game that is still receiving new content is disappointing civ v remains my favorite in the series for now edit april 23 2021 despite working on more bug fixes the game still crashes on larger maps there is also an official huge true starting location map now that is actually rather small and bad for large numbers of ai civs edit july 2 2023 it s a shame that there are so many good ideas in this game when it s as unstable as it is it probably won t ever be fixed
