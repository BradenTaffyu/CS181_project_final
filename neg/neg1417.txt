2023 sadly after really wanting this to be a good game and giving it the benefit of the doubt for years i have to say that it is just bad and it is never going to get better the primary gameplay loop is basically ride around stab people repeat the community has been vocal about clear improvements they want to add depth but tw is painfully slow to add anything of substance so the community steps in and fixes the problem with mods then tw makes some sort of petty update that breaks all the mods but does not improve the game i stopped playing the game 2 years ago to give the devs time to finish the game and all the mods to catch back up i recently picked it up again most of the best modders got tired of updating their mods to keep pace with the game so their mods just don t work now i legit can t notice any significant changes in the base game from when i stopped playing 2 years ago within 2 weeks of playing again tw dropped another patch that improved little and made my modded game crash to desktop on start tw will never finish this game and they will never give the modders the option to finish the game it was better 2 years ago when i stopped playing and nobody today should buy it
