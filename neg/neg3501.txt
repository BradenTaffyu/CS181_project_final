2022 product received for free disclaimer this review is highly subjective and mostly intended for players who played the first game and may be thinking about buying the second one if you haven t played the first one it may not be very relevant for you i m torn between recommending and not recommending this game steam really needs a can t decide button in addition to yes no or maybe a system with points stars like in google play store or similar a little bit about me i m a die hard dinosaur fan i absolutely love the jp jw franchise and i ve played the first jurassic world evolution game before at first i was thoroughly disappointed because i saw jwe2 as a step backwards even though it does some things better than the predecessor it also does many things worse which overall made it less enjoyable than its predecessor for me what it does better than jwe1 bigger maps much better graphics many diverse biomes overall the maps are much more unique all of them have their own foliage sets the ability to send dinosaurs from the hatchery directly into an enclosure in the first game you had to release them tranquilise them then send them into another enclosure or build one hatchery for every enclosure the former is time consuming the latter needs a ton of space you could use for other things you can incubate several dinosaurs of the same species at once in one hatchery slot this makes it much easier and quicker to populate your parks challenge mode has been vastly improved every challenge map is unique in the challenges it gives you on one you are for example not allowed to release carnivores to progress another one has high costs for administration and management or maybe dinosaurs with specific traits that really impact gameplay overall this really sets all the challenge levels apart from each other all of them offer a unique experience this may be a very minor thing but the addition of the repeater substation which allows you to build parks without cables and pylons yay more dinosaurs in the base game 67 dinosaurs plus 6 species of marine reptile plus 6 species of flying reptile 79 species compared to 37 in jwe1 tours and monorails can now be used as a second arrival point allowing you to build a park without continous path connection a much improved ui the build menus make much more sense as to where you can find things and the ui has been shrunk down so you can see more of the game now better contracts and challenge cards where you must decide between 2 non optimal options like having to choose from losing one of your staff members or spending a lot of money to keep them which overall makes the gameplay very interesting as you never know what to expect nextwhat it does worse than jwe1 scientists you now need to manage your staff as well hire scientists train them make sure to make them rest so they don t sabotage your park etc it s a very time consuming task and they cannot be turned off except in sandbox mode you will end up managing them more than you will actually manage the dinosaurs this is not what i wanted from a dinosaur park management simulation the campaign is pretty much a joke it should really be renamed tutorial because that s all what it does if i think back to the campaign in jwe1 that was a great and lenghty campaign that really gave you satisfaction for finally completing it this one does not you ask yourself that s it and it doesn t feel complete at all it s like 10 hours only jwe1 s is 40 50 hours and most importantly it doesn t give you any rewards for completing it in jwe1 you unlock stuff in other game modes by playing through the campaign and i really like the sense of progression it provided on every new island you had access to more and more things the amount of bugs is very unnerving now i know that this game is very new but it really feels more rushed than anything else especially when it comes to artificial intelligence sadly i cannot provide a list of bugs as this would make the review too long even though the chaos theory and challenge modes are all very unique i never felt like continuing to play them after i had achieved the 5 stars with the notable exception of the jurassic world dominion scenarios this is quite the opposite of the jwe1 maps i played on so far with the exception of sanctuary i continued to play on all of them even after i had completed all the main tasks overall it feels like they focused on the wrong things in the sequel less on the dinosaurs and more on the management stuff the game has too much micromanaging to be thoroughly enjoyable to me the genetics system is much worse than in the predecessor instead of the dinosaurs having specific traits expressed in numbers that you can influence individually by splicing certain genes you can make dinosaurs that live super long have an incredibly high rating have superb combat stats or incredible resistance to disease or a balance of all of this however you wanted the possibilities were nearly endless here all we have now is certain traits long lived strong aggressive docile etc and all you can influence now is the chance of a dinosaurs having these traits like 50 chance to be long lived or 100 chance to be aggressive in addition to that most of the bigger dinosaurs have negative traits by default that you ll want to balance out by investing points in the opposite direction this is pretty much the end of customization for dinosaur genomes also with the secrets of dr wu dlc in the first game you could influence a dinosaur s social habitat and comfort requirements which gave you even more customization and more power over genetics that is gone now as well unless they release another dlc for this but i doubt it tbh this is something that i really enjoyed in the first game in my opinion they should have left out the lagoons lagoons are incredibly boring i almost never build lagoons due to them having 0 customization all you can change is the layout and the feeders and where you place the viewing attractions that s it no terrain manipulation no underwater plants or rocks you can put into lagoons or maybe sunken scenery to spice things up a bit i m not a game designer or anything but i would have so many ideas of how you could make them more interesting there s so much lost potential here no tour rides for lagoons also obviously marine animals can never escape and terrorize your guests lagoons are just so trivial that i really wonder why they included them also the water is so murky that you can barely see anything and when you sit in one of the viewing galleries in first person you can almost never spot the animals in there the jurassic park era buildings are back however unlike the ones in the return to jurassic park dlc for jwe1 they look very generic no more tropical thatch roofs and there aren t even jurassic themed restrooms or food stands those were just left out for no reason when i played the jurassic park chaos theory i never got that this is jurassic park vibe that i got in the first game with the dlc so the jurassic era is definitely better in the first game overall i still enjoy playing the predecessor more than the successor which is not how it should be and in my opinion jwe2 s biggest problem is that jwe1 exists and does many things better has full modding support and very few bugs jwe2 is not a bad game but it has definite flaws and odd design choices that really impact my gameplay experience i do have fun playing jwe2 and i will continue to play it in the future but once i ve unlocked all skins and done all challenge maps then only in sandbox mode where you can turn off some annoyances like the scientists in the settings i d give the game 2 3 stars out of 5 you might love it from the start if you ve never played jwe1 but i didn t
