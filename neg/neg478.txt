2023 long time fallout fan played most of them this game is a complete travesty just utterly terrible it s 2023 and i still run into issues where i can t even enter buildings because of the always online server messing up there is still a delay between shooting enemies and them registering pain it s clear that the only support this game has gotten was ensuring it s crappy atom shop still works there s daily operations that pay out better than any actual quest in the game though they are balanced around top tier meta strategies and you can t use stealth or anything so get screwed if you are trying any sort of gimmick build those are also ops where some level 500 dude can join your team and all of a sudden you do scratch damage when you were one shotting enemies before the only actual elements that warrant online play are horribly balanced like this every free to play nonsense mechanic is at play here and the base game just isn t very fun there s an ok core game here but you have to wade through a lot of crap to find it and when you get basic glitches preventing you from continuing until you switch servers or try again later it dampens the experience incredibly and makes me not want to bother save your money and play any other fallout game
