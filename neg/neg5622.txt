2018 the recent free update which isn t a dlc that can be toggled on or off is forcing the consumer to accept the use of female generals and possible leaders in a historically authentic themed game where women rights were limited during the set time period is quite abhorrent not because oh i m a massive alt right sexist hehehe but because it being forced upon us if you compare the dlc daughters of mars to this free update is that the dlc is completely optional and the choice is for the consumer to have female soldiers or not whether you agree with it or not in a historic case it s not but again it s optional but instead of doing that they ve forced us to have it in our game and with the notorious reply from ca ella saying either mod it out or don t play it is yet again spitting in the community s face the exect same way ea did to their community and fans and we can all see the backlash from that wake the bloody hell up ca either remove the feature or release it as a dlc but do not force it on people if they don t want it
