2016 i m tired of all these dlcs and their inflated prices the content added often brings new depth to the game but frequently has features that we shouldn t have to pay for i m looking at you nation designer also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing if you look at other game companies they often give comparable content for free as an update at the very base of it i m sick of all this piece meal dlc i can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game but seriously the cossack s cost is 50 of the price of the base game and don t you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks not anything expansive it s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free i love the concept of a game developing after its release but don t make me pay for every slight tweak also don t talk to me about steam sales the most recent releases only get 35 off for the cossacks that s roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly 13 dollar left to pay whoopee do by the time we get a substantial deal on any dlc it s often way down the line and paradox has already churned out another one all of this means two plainly disappointing facts you ll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any paradox game and that when a new game releases it s evident you re only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game however i know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product and so this just another ranting guy on the internet is going to reach into his wallet pull out his credit card and buy the next grand expansion for eu4 because oh well right update 4 10 16 with the release of mare nostrum it s evident that pardox interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion this is pitiful and doesn t show well for the future of hearts of irons 4 stellaris and their other franchises these are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of dlc fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment paradox knows what it s doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products the only action i d want them to take is in their dlc practices if you re going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding main dlc expanision then lower the prices to 9 99 and lower you may think you ll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices but you ll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this if the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term if you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired our else your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like sega who specifically has turned ca and relic entertainment into dlc producing cash cows that take all the heat your ceo has stated you re undergoing the ipo process therefore you ll be an option for buyout within a year or two the gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity you re on a path that will be your undoing please become something better paradox not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers p s 5 28 16 europa universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable it stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience paradox is becoming a disappointment if they aren t already
