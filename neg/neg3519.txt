2023 this game is a lovely haven for dinosaur lovers at least the ones not planning to spend over 30 hours pouring their heart into it it seems when your park grows big enough a glitch in the dino ai starts killing them all one by one by rendering them stuck in place every 5 seconds or indefinitely even when they are looking for food water and are directly next to water food they can t move so they slowly starve and die some have luck tranqing the dinos some have to restart the game but for most this glitch hasn t ever cleared up my case it s to the point now that no matter how good of wifi ethernet gaming laptop i have the glitch is here to stay the devs have known about this for at least a year now and still haven t fixed this please try guys so much work has gone into this and it s heartbreaking to see my park unplayable with slideshows of dinosaurs
