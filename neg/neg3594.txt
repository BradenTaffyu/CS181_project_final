2019 early access review i am not enjoying a17 at all almost every building you go into contains a zombie ambush making them predictable silly and immersion breaking and i m not talking about zombies that happen to be in rooms i mean they are literally waiting in closets walls and ceilings for you to show up and trigger them why are they there they decided to make zombies intelligent so they now path around traps and obstacles why zombies already have a massive numbers advantage and during a blood moon they also have a speed advantage did we get new tools to deal with the greater threat no instead they actually removed some the better options we had e g no more turning zombies into crawlers using spikes i vastly preferred the old leveling system where you got better at the skills you used by actually using them now you grind out zombie kills to gain levels to earn skill points to buy feats i don t know if it s worse than before but i m also experiencing serious hit detection problems with melee weapons and tools
