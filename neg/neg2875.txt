2016 i really enjoy this game but i m one of the people that always checks negative reviews to better understand what i m getting into so here goes stellaris is a great starting point to an amazing 4x space game it is made to be mod friendly and it shows in base gameplay you can mod in your own races change starting conditions of the galaxy and just about anything you can imagine however it also seems that it will be up to the mods to really take this game to the next level in the vanilla version so what holds this game back i would say the scale of what this game will be actually hurts the fun of the vanilla game at launch the diplomacy is simple i like you no war or ooh planet declare war out of nowhere the planet screens remind me a lot of moo or more accurately sid meier s colonization town screens you move your pops create buildings to increase resource output and generally try to min max your tiles however 22 years is a long time to leave a concept nearly the same combat oh combat if you are coming from eu4 ck2 then combat will probably be a step up you can customize your ships a la every 4x space game now and group them in fleets to attack however actual combat is just moving stacks onto eachother as in eu4 the feedback is fairly minimal but does provide the info to know what major adjustments to your ships you need to make minor details about which modules are effective would be helpful so overall opinion i m enjoying it i will spend this week making the galaxy trump again however if you are expecting anything near the polish of eu4 remember what eu4 was like on launch the dlc and patches for this game will be what really determines how great this game is edit for clarity the reason it is not recommended is because this is not at the same level of polish and complexity as other paradox games right now if you are looking for that wait a little while however for the price i would still recommend it by itself and i fully believe it will end up surpassing my hours on eu4 556 and counting as the free patches and dlc expand the gameplay edit 2 for more clarity if you are someone who loves the depth and complexity of eu4 ck2 i recommend you wait for some more content to be added so it s more of a conditional don t recommend thanks for all the feedback
