2022 obligatory negative review for 1 the continuation of total war warhammer 1 s destruction of total war sieges 2 the continuation of total war wahammer 1 s reduction of unit capabilities to the point where 10 minutes is a long battle instead of a short one 3 lazy and scummy dlc selling a graphics setting toggle is not cute 4 charging 60 for a digital product 5 years after its release it s not even a unique digital product it s a copy of its predecessor this entire game is essentially an expansion that they get you to pay the price of a game for so that they can make more dlc and sell you that too 5 removal of mlaa antaliasing in the face of how unoptimized the game becomes when being forced to use multisampling or how blurry it becomes when being forced to use fxaa if you re going to take money from hardware companies to make my experience worse can you at least take that money out of the price of the game i have decided to update this review after playing to mention that this total war has probably more ai cheats than any other total war in existence ai will take 500 gold of income and use that to support 4000 gold upkeep worth of armies with one small settlement that started as a ruin which they somehow maxed everything out in everyone will declare war on the player from opposite sides of the map with no provocation ai will focus the player intentionally ai get boosted growth meaningless levels of attrition and so many cheats it is mind boggling their strategies are terrible so when you actually fight them then you slaughter them however be prepared to fight the entire map by yourself as in this one once you re at war making peace is nigh impossible edit2 this game somehow trashed loading times completely from warhammer 1 i had an old slow standard hdd in wh1 that and loaded 4x faster than i load with this game on a faster dedicated drive feels like they just gave up trying to optimize load times
