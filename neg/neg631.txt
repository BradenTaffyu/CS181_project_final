2017 i was really looking forward to this game and i had some fun with it but the negatives are constantly outweighing any fun i ve been having neverending bugs keep cropping up and breaking gameplay quest bugs mechnic bugs combat bugs the list goes on enemies seemingly don t follow all the same combat rules as you difficulty is disproportionate to level no enemy scaling more like a cliff the whole charm mechanic coupled with the super op enemies makes it so you ll be spending multiple combat rounds just sitting there doing nothing except waiting for the game over screen little to no direction in any quests means you have reams of failed quests or quests you just can t ever proceed on crafting is almost useless and feels shoehorned in sometimes voice overs just cut out no idea why
