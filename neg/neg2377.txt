2022 i recall when it went to epic store this game was on my wishlist then close to release we found out it wasen t going to be available on steam now 4 years after game is back to steam but wait we can t even get a discount on those million dlc that kept releasing every other month hard pass on this one even though i love to have all my games on steam no way i recommend this anti consumer practices
