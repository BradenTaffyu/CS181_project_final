edit 3 7 23 after dev responded unfortunately the problems i listed below aren t isolated to just me 6 friends experience the exact same problems and they re all 100 reproducible by just trying to play online as previously stated i did list all of the problems to support last year and unfortunately not a single one has been addressed it appears that dlc is the only focus at this stage so keep that in mind if any of the listed problems may affect your intended consumption of the product solid game if you re playing solo and want to pick it up on sale if you happen to have friends then that multiplayer experience is diminished by a multitude of bugs and sync issues i reached out to support with a list of the problems which are 100 reproducible and didn t get anywhere when 2 players are near each other the animals will freeze up animations don t sync animals don t react to sounds or being shot major buzzkill gun shots always sound like they re coming from miles away even if you re standing right next to someone musket effects sound don t sync across clients at all projectiles and impacts don t sync across clients especially lame for the arrow bolt weapons can t see regular arrows bolts nor the tracer ones animal caller audio sync problems some you can t hear at all other when used from a mile away sound like they re right in your ear as if the person was next to you leaderboards not working at alli haven t played in a little bit because all of these problems were diminishing the experience with friends it doesn t look like there is interest in getting them fix judging by the lack of responses when trying to reach out to the dev via support and social media only get this if your intention is to play alone and the game is on sale
