game used to be really good great modding community after being acquired by saber quality has gone far down what used to be updates that would be added to base game with no charge are now dlc most mods have been broken by saber s updates to be more like console play the ui is made for console now not pc the game runs much worse and crashes often this is probably why they allow you to roll back to a pre acquisition state in steam options
