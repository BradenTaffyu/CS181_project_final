2018 apocalypse made it unplayable for me the product i first bought has been transformed into a game that i no longer like there were some bumps along the road before the 2 0 update understandable now the game has changed so much it feels like i bought a totally different game then was advertised no more freedom of playing the style you like as in selecting warpdrive hyperlane wormhole only games i understand the need to make things more tactical instead of deathstacking everything but for me it feels like it could have been done by building special outposts or outpost upgrades that disable enemy fleets crossing through their space it be by jumping through or over it or warping past it maybe have special jumpships that accompany fleets being able to spy on the enemy fleets just something to force not putting all your eggs in 1 basket without making a totally different game maybe there need to be more settings to make the universe you want leave it to the player how they want to play just something that doesn t make it a completely different product then the game we all bought luckily you can roll back the version i m confident they will try to make things better but for now after all this time and such a big change i do not agree with the game
