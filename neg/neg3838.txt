2015 early access review from the creators of aclaimed tittles such as gore ultimate soldier patriots a nation under fire and secret service 2 here we got 7 days to die the horde survival crafting zombie game i recommend researching those tittles to understand better what goes on lets do this in parts its such a mental mess i will have to make an effort to keep focus i used to like this game very much yeah you read right about over a year ago the game was good and kinda fun i was ignorant and everything was promissing then some day they somehow managed to ruin what made the game fun and turned it into a massive pointless grind it was such a pointless grind before but lets say the grind was optional and was about working your ass to build now its becoming a refilling gauges simulator lets talk about these overlapping grinds and the ones to be added soon for sure wellness grind its basically some mechanic they brough up from their arses to make the game artificially harder and longer the concept is simple you start with half the hp and stamina a normal person would have and you have to gain your way to being a healthy person abusing game mechanics will increase it quickly making it pointless once you abuse them enough dying will decrease it a pointless grind that will just make you go nuts for how crippled your character seems to be at the start and also makes pvp not so desirable but not only that once you grind it its completely out of place and have no meaning as game mechanic to add content as it was sold its value as feature 1 10 level grind at this point you get level in 2 ways killing zombies and crafting junk yeah its just that gaining levels will allow you to do stuff of higher quality and this is where the thing becomes complex they have mixed this level grind with the crafting quality and the chances of getting good stuff from containers aka leveled loot this is a funny mechanic for a coop multiplayer game that leads to lame metagaming so the level s grindl works for both crafting and looting but that is today coz in the next patch they will add another super awesome layer of grinding skill leveling grind the new kid of the block yeah you read right as it wasnt tiresome enough before thy come with the nice idea of adding another 20 grinds on top which isnt bad actually if they had really added new mechanics or exciting stuff that made you level while just having fun but that doesnt seem to be the case you will be doing basically the same stuff you have done in the 12 alphas before but this time trying to fill another 20 more gauges so you can improve i really fail to see the survival aspect here the main diference is i had to kill 3000 zombies and craft 5000 wodden ladders to reach full performance doing stuff like tools and armors now you need to do it for basically every action you can do it ingame meanwhile at the same time they are streamlining it for the next patch which is basically a cool way to say dumbing it down adding health bars big arrows in front of your screen so you figure out things that part is kinda insulting they have reduced many materials to the basics changed the food to a single generic meat material etc etc they are basically making it more like more popular games like rust or ark instead of going for their own niche this is the main flaw i find about this game the crafting menu for the next update is a cloned version of rust s one this got me permabanned from the fun pimp forums but more about this later which isnt bad but its something else not what this game was at first problem is that they have been just redoing stuff mostly for like forever and having little advances the gunplay it is very basic its based in raycast and weapons are very arcade with no aparent recoil and very glitchy when you use ironsights something that has been happening since i first played this game about alpha 8 bullets dont exist you dont really enjoy killing the zombies like in other games like lets say killing floor but when its a massive horde of zombies its exciting seeing them not so much shooting them down you just kill them coz you need to this might change a bit in the next patch since they are adding dismembering and some mocap animations the sound the sound only can be described as terrible basically a mess distances dont exist and position is complicated many sounds are recorded in diferent levels making you having to manage your volume while playing or just go deaf someday this is supossed to be better for alpha 13 where they have recorded new sounds and updated the sound engine graphics graphics are ok even good for a game of this kind the draw distance is terrible though it feels like you are in the little s prince world anyway graphics arent that important for a solid game the comunity if you like feeling like in north korea this is your game worst comunity i ever saw in a videogame worst forum moderators i ever meet in a videogame too in my 20 years playing online fun pimps cant take critics not even feedback anything they dont like moderators go wild with editing threats and bans its like that in both their oficial forums and the steam s section for it you rather just follow the official line where its all about increasing mod s ego and shoulder patting or your are tagged as a troll the amount of shoulder patting silly post editing and ass licking is so borderline that is embarrassing seriously amazing its not videogames anymore but they are like rock band s fans or something censorship is rampant anyone with decent feedback but negative feedback is tagged as a troll and marginated or even treated by mods depending their mood or how much shoulder patting and ass licking they have produced before actually the forums have more survival aspects than the game itself just not the kind i try to find when playing a videogame typical responses there are generic you can mod it or its alpha or its early acess any smart person can see the irony here its sad seeing such egos a developer team who was basically begging years ago for cash that goes full ego mode and disrespect their fans with stuff like calling half their users 12 yo cry babys after a situation they actually have produced theirselves for the release of this last alpha its an issue they created theirselves with poor pr then just censoship when the hits teh fan very bad they basically have failed as persons not coz the game is bad but coz they have no principles but this is not new they had a half developer forum mod troll before called dochussey before it was super amusing back then super pr anyone who read that guy at least once knows what i mean the bans yes its not a myth i got banned there in fun pimps s forums it was fun one of the super fanboys was there saying he she just have played rust that last weekend and what he though was innovative remember they are copying rust craft for next patch turned to just imitation and was upset about it moderator came in claiming that was and that the guys doing the ui never have played rust after i pointed out that it was a copy warning me so i replied him in pm asking why he had to lie to users specially since they dont pay him why not just to admit what is evident and that was it malthis is such a nice guy and he loves all the attention sorry man i pity your non paid job but even nicer i also got banned in the steam forus by that guy eagle who is like a super power tripping mod just coz i pointed out how shady was the link your steam account to the fun pimps forum account policy not that i care about the bans really its actually good to know what kind of people they are so my veredict avoid it not worth the hassle
