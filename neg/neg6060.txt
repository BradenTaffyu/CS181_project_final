2016 i have never reviewed a game prior to this but can t help have a bit of a moan about paradox whilst i love this game and most of the genre hoi crusader kings and the eu series the engine is much the same as previous versions of the game i am not asking paradox to to reinvent the wheel every time they release a new version and whilst a real effort is made to improve the game at each iteration not only do you have to pay full price for each game despite owning previous ones you are expected to buy the dlc just to make the game work the way it should have in the first place i checked today during a sale where there is a 66 reduction in the cost of dlc it would still cost me an additional 63 00 to get it all and i already have 23 dlc s bringing what i have spent on the game to well over 140 that s insane without the sale it would have cost 189 00 what the paradox people complain about the likes of wot or stronghold kingdoms being pay to play games but at the very least they are honest whilst i really enjoy this kind of strategy and paradox are streets ahead in this type of game i just can t recommend it because of the all the dlc that s required to make it complete
