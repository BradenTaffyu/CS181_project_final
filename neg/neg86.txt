2016 early access review the steam release date is so misleading this game has actually been in developement for more like 5 years i totally sympathize with the studio what with their building being robbed of its computers and code at one point in developement but its at a situation now where they should just bite the bullet and hire on more programmers we ve been waiting on npc s for years now i definitely recommend this game but only once the npc metagame is added and truly justifies base building update people trying to defend this game need to go look at the forest which was made in less time with an equally small staff update 2 i wrote this review in 2016 we are now in the end of 2021 and the last update to the game was about three years ago development on this game is non existent don t expect any new features if you buy this game
