2020 if a game is going to be filled with microtransactions it should be free to play even after 2 3 years the game remains poorly optimized hopefully microsoft can improve this in future titles i m not looking forward to elder scrolls vi if they re still using an outdated engine the reliance on fallout 1st for season rewards feels like a scam i understand needing a subscription but with seasons lasting several months you re forced to pay for multiple months of fallout 1st to unlock certain rewards at least in other games purchasing a battle pass or season pass gives you the option to unlock everything until the season ends now that my fallout 1st subscription has expired i m locked out of four rewards this is a bad practice
