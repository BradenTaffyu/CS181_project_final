2016 notice my hours played notice the hours played for many others who give the game thumbs down i started to write a very long review to describe each aspect of the game and how i feel the devs dropped the ball but instead i ll just focus upon what i believe is the most broken part of the game diplomacy stellaris uses the same old diplomacy that pretty much every other 4x game uses and it s awful the system itself is broken and no amount of tinkering is going to fix it either the player is able to predictably benefit from interacting with the other race in which case the player will do so or the player is going to ignore the diplomacy system in which case it is nothing more than a bother for me star ruler 2 is the best space 4x game to be released so far and this game adds very little to the genre the event system is nice but they need to add hundreds more events because right now the same handful of events are repeated over and over i give stellaris a thumbs down even though it s not a horrible game maybe after some more patches mods content is released i ll write a new review but for now i d recommend staying away from it edit though nobody is going to look at this old review after going back and playing a bunch of crusader kings 2 i now know exactly why i found stellaris to be disappointing it s not cursader kings 2 in space which is what it needed to be or at least much closer to crusader kings 2
