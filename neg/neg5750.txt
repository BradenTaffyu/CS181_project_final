2018 i have no problem with females in a game i do have a problem with devs being great game terrible management i can t recommend you spend your hard earned money on an overpriced 5 year old unfinished product owned by people who have a if you don t like it then gtfo mentality that s for 12 year olds on a forum not developers on a soapbox i hope it was worth it ca in the future maybe invest in a pr department to handle your public statements
