2019 this was my favourite paradox game and the only one i have played and followed since release most paradox games i buy with a bunch of dlcs a couple years into the games life cycle typically they are fun but overly complex having to spend ages reading guides and watching tutorials of certain mechanics does not endear new players to a game and tend to have too much micromanaging stellaris was different it was more accessible for new players and felt like it had a good balance between complexity and streamlining there was depth but it wasn t overly complex more importantly the greatest aspect of the game was that it really felt like you were exploring new uncharted planets you could see the planet surface the different terrains the indigenous creatures now it seems like stellaris has been morphed into just another paradox title probably driven by as what another user has described as the vocal minority of paradox players who frequent the paradox forums want their gaming experience to resemble an excel spreadsheet as closely as possible and berate other players for wanting the game to be too easy i m fully supportive of updating and tweaking a video game and adding new content post release but when you consistently overhaul the game to the point that it is not even really the same game i paid for that s not okay not to mention the fact that every few months with each new update your saved games are made redundant and you have to spend at least an hour trying to familiarise yourself with the new or changed mechanics the latest update completely takes away the feeling of exploring and colonising new planets with less visual art and more you guessed it numbers in it s place planets are now pretty much indistinguishable from one another i did express my concerns regarding this during the dev diaries but alas paradox only care about keeping their core base of actuaries i mean players happy now each planet looks pretty much the same and not particularly nice to look at visually there is way more micromanagment they have changed a lot of the buildings less simple more specialised there are like 10 20 new jobs you have to assign your pops to in a drop down instead of just dragging your pop onto the tile building as you did before and there are more resources meaning that before where you needed to balance energy minerals and research now you have to worry about lots more i probably won t play this game again as it will just get worse with future updates and i m seriously reconsidering pre ordering imperator rome as that will likely suffer a similar fate
