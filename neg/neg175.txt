2018 i finally got around to playing nier automata after hearing a lot of praise about the game i have not played any of the previous games set in this universe so this review is my opinion of nier automata as it is presented on its own the game is set in a post apocalyptic world in which remnants of humanity now live on the moon after humans were almost annihilated by invading aliens and their machines they are sending androids to earth to fight against the machines and you play as the androids switching between several perspectives throughout the game the presentation of the story is innovative in that it is not finished when the player beats the game for the first time after that the player needs to finish the second playthrough and then the third one to get the full story while this is certainly an original idea the way it is delivered suffers from poor pacing the main campaign in the first and second playthroughs is the same but experienced through different characters the second playthrough contains additional cutscenes viewed from the point of view of an omniscient narrator which suggests that they were left out of the first playthrough in order to add more content later not because it would be logical to see these cutscenes while playing as the second protagonist as a result in the first playthrough the story is too vague and frankly not really interesting while the second playthrough feels too repetitive the third playthrough contains completely new events and that is when the story really picks up and actually becomes interesting but in order to get there you have to go through a lot of the game where the story is not fully explained for the purpose of revealing it later or is being repeated additionally pacing is impacted by the amount of backtracking required nier automata does not allow players to save the game whenever or to teleport from any location instead they need to stay in the vicinity of an access point to save or interact with the access point directly to teleport as a result of which the player spends a lot of time running to and from access points while questing furthermore teleporting is not unlocked until a few hours into the game the world is not very big and there is a lot of time spent running to and from the same areas access points this combined with the fact that you need to play through half of the campaign twice results in a game that feels overly repetitive perhaps it would not feel so repetitive if the weather ever changed or if there was a day night cycle but there isn t one so locations mostly always look the same when you visit them in addition to that i personally strongly dislike the colour scheme of the game the colours look very washed out in sunlit areas and there is a lack of contrast that makes the game look drab and unappealing in addition the enemy design is kind of boring outside of boss enemies many of the mobs are some variation of cylinders on legs with balls for heads with some of them having propellers instead of legs so they can fly when it comes to the design of androids on the other hand they re your run of the mill sexy anime characters they don t particularly stand out in any way outside of their bdsm inspired outfits there is never any reason given for why one of the main characters 2b has to have a waist high slit in her short dress to show off her white underwear the game goes out of its way to allow the player to look at her undergarments when climbing up ladders the camera pans up to give a good view of 2b s derriere when 2b is running the camera slowly pans down to allow the player to look under her dress the first time when this character is presented in a cutscene the camera first shows her legs and naked thighs under her dress and then pans up to reveal the rest of her body similarly in many other cutscenes the game chooses to show 2b from the side where the dress slit allows the player to get a clear view of her panties in addition to that the player may choose to self destruct which makes 2b lose the bottom half of her dress completely other female androids are also either dressed skimpily or in bondage evoking outfits i am not really familiar with the aesthetics of character design in japan but i have been told that this kind of over sexualisation is normal in their media personally i find it silly that this whole android force designed to defend the last of humanity from an overwhelming threat looks like someone interrupted a bdsm party there is no in game explanation or contemplation about why they are dressed this way the game purports to provoke the player to consider what it means to be alive or to be human but at the same time the main characters display no desire for introspection or curiosity as to why they look the way they do this over sexualized android design and the lack of awareness of it is thematically at odds with the kind of introspection and contemplation that the game is trying to provoke through the story perhaps i wouldn t find the outfits so problematic if the female characters weren t so poorly developed their motivations are implied but not explored and their character arc is not shown or properly communicated in addition 2b s english voice actress is a bit sub par for a main character but she wasn t given much lines to work with so perhaps her underperformance is not surprising the combat on the other hand is quite fun the attacks and movement are fluid the animations are excellent it is particularly satisfying how seamlessly the characters transition from different directions during the evade animation or from evade to attack and vice versa etc the enemies also very satisfyingly explode in a shower of money items upon dying in addition to melee attacks the player can also do a variety of ranged attacks by using the pod an external support device for the androids on normal difficulty there s not much depth to combat as there s not much need for strategy after i started finding and using chips that allowed me to heal by damaging or killing enemies fighting mobs became trivial and bosses were not much more challenging either the playstyle can be customized by equipping chips that boost damage or defence enable healing increase drop rates xp gain and similar since the characters are androids it makes sense that they would be modified by installing chips in them and i love the mechanic there is a wide variety of chips and they can be upgraded while the chip storage can be expanded to allow the installation of a large number of them this review has already gone on for far too long but there are a few things i still want to mention firstly the music is very good but the soundtrack would benefit from having a lot more songs because the repetitiveness of the game results in the player spending a lot of time in the same area listening to the same song secondly in areas where the perspective changes from third person to top down or side scrolling it can be difficult to distinguish the player character from their sidekick as they re both dressed in black and the fighting effects obscure their models i think these sections could have been implemented better perhaps by adding different coloured outfits for the characters i was disappointed and frankly surprised there was no such option finally the game is a bad port and needs the far mod to be playable on pc without much issues in conclusion story construction is original but suffers from poor pacing combat is fun but not very challenging on normal difficulty art and design are largely uninspiring questing requires too much backtracking port quality is bad but there s a mod to fix it features i would expect from an open world game that are missing day night cycle and weather customization of character appearance ability to save whenever
