2021 i really enjoyed this game when i played it two years ago one day it stopped working all of a sudden i ve spent hours working through the recommend fixes with no luck and bethseda customer service really sucks if this is such a widespread problem they really needed to release a patch or something yes i did get over a hundred hours out of the game but i paid it to play it not to rent it edit i have finally managed to get on i stand by my comments though and leave the original negative review because this is something that should have been fixed a long time ago
