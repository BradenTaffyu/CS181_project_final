2015 i have played every eu game since the first and i still can t love them it feels like you are playing against the game mechanics instead of the ai the rules are excessively fussy and new rules are made up for different countries religions cultures etc it comes across as band aids on top of band aids rather than a rich system of detail and rebellions are just ridiculous massive armies just spring into existence while it would take you ages to create the same thing i get that they want to model that enormous alien empires face disruption but the mechanics are still heavy handed and violate the intricate rules that the designers themselves made up
