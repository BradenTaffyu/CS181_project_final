2022 the game so far looks like a fine city builder strategy game edit 4 hours it s actually a really good city builder really good stuff i bought it unaware of the defiantly sleazy tactics apparently used by ubisoft before and now after they decided they could sell their title elsewhere then when that didn t work shamelessly return to steam while apparently as seen in dozens and dozens of user reviews you can read yourself breaching the promise of providing dlc content to people who pre ordered the game on this platform before ubisoft decided they could do better for themselves on their own terrible platform and the not as terrible but still pretty terrible infamous epic store how embarrassing no this isn t about that this is about my experiences attempting to simply run the game i purchased yesterday first it wouldn t launch at all then after reading on a third party website to try and open the exe as admin the game tried to launch after first opening ubisoft connect ugh which promptly demanded a key password i did not have i checked in the remember quite terrible ubisoft launcher where it had no idea i d bought the title among the other handful of games the cursed thing did admit i owned the solution to this i gratefully received from a steam user whose handle i can t remember i had to launch both steam and ubisoft connect as administrator then run the game which did finally work but before i came back to it i gave up for a few hours totally furious and in awe of just how awful this company really is it s a meme in itself that ubisoft s the worst but time and again it just proves itself true it s totally true i have no idea why counting this disaster i ve now four clear and irreparably damaging experiences of anger frustration and even rage with ubisoft products not to mention ubisoft practices which have become by now legendary there s being incompetent and then there s ubisoft who seem to act both incompetently cynically socially pandering and aggressively anti consumer which is the worst triptych look a aaa video game company can have shame on u ubisoft you may own brands we love but they re not yours you can t ruin them despite your very best efforts the talented developers deserve so much better than you re clearly willing to provide in this decade we all do because we be hard you be soft best to everyone out there b
