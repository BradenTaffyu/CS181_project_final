2016 i ve played most of the total war titles and was greatly enthralled with how they pushed for accurate representations of realistic forces throughout history my favorite is medieval ii one of medieval ii s virtues was the ability to confront super elite forces aka mounted knights in full armor with a large rabble of peasants with spears and have a decent chance of winning battles came down to planning tactics and command and control often through placement movement of the general for morale purposes another major boon was the large number of factions you could play as england france scotland poland egypt etc there was about 15 or so kingdoms you could play making replaying a fun task that i still enjoy today ok that s the context now for total war warhammer i ve been continuously trying to give this game my all i ve played empire orcs dwarves vampire counts and chaos i ve played them single player and multiplayer each faction has unique traits and querks that make them a gem to relish and build narratives around for your own personal stories in the warhammer universe the character leveling is fairly nice too allowing you to assign the traits and qualities of a given lord general so that he can work in a given capacity better i d argue than medieval ii where those qualities were randomly generated based on generally speaking the character s chivalry dread rating the graphics are stellar and it s fantastic to have the characters in battle physically identical to their portraits not the first total war to do this but it s still a positive thing for the game unfortunately there s a lot wrong with the game first is the gameplay the battles like every total war title since rome ii feel smaller more rushed more streamlined less refined and closer to what i d expect for a world of tanks match than a medieval battle you can generally tell within the first few seconds of units meeting in melee how the fight will go and unless something drastic changes the losing side will break within 3 5 min don t expect any battle to last longer than 10 15 min beacuse once your units start breaking chances are the rest of your army will say this i m going home extending off of this i ve seen far too many instances of ranged units being completely useless handgunners for the empire pour volley after volley into warriors of chaos and i see depressingly few fall despite the fact that muskets and handguns were one of the very reasons that armor was phased out of combat in the 16 18th centuries higher tier units will always beat lower tier units spears ha my armored cavalry laugh at your spears again any sense of reality with this game is thrown out the window like it s the second defenstration of prague second negative thing unbalanced factions every faction is a specialist army that has it s own glariingly major perks with subtle if any drawbacks chaos has heavy armor and cannons which will devastate your army but lack archers not that it matters because they have cannons dwarves have archers guns cannons and helicopters but no spearmen but they have plenty of durable axmen to hold the line anyway the lsit goes on the only faction that has an all round force is the empire but they are underrated in every role if you re playing multiplayer and you re running the empire you re going to lose period every single game i ve tried the empire with my friends has seen my imperials walked over and routed one game by only halve of my opponent s army more on this later third there is an amazing high number of factions you can play a whole whopping 6 with dlc never mind that the actual number of factions in the game is exponentially higher you re stuck playing a named special character from gw s tabletop game why because you that s why fourth dlc so we ve had some dlc come out for the game so far the blood and gore scam to nickle and dime customers continues making it free and optional would have been better or better still just put the option in the settings and then we have the beastmen dear god the beastmen beastmen deserve their own special paragraph here it s overly expensive dlc which gave me pause as well as the fact that i lacked the funds at the time and i decided to let my friends test it out first for game balance viability and general taste i was told that they are well balanced against the other factions and they are very fair and reasonable my asscheeks i played two games against them first one my empire force was wrecked by my buddy who never used half of his army when my force broke and ran his response was wait that s all you have this coming after losing every single game i ve played with the empire the second game was a 2v2 two empire vs chaos and beastmen the beastmen player split his army to hit our forces from both the front and the rear i deployed my whole army to cover the force advancing from behind unlike before my line held only to be steamrolled by the other forces that pac manned the front ok ok i thought maybe we re just not used to facing them yet they should be reasonable in the single player campaign right no i started a campaign up and i was wiped within 10 campaign turns because the beastmen gangbanged me with my normal adversaries at that point i said i m done close the program uninstall and post this so that others don t waste their time and money
