2018 i m not hr nor is it my job to push a personal agenda but if you don t like it simpley mod it out or don t play it jeeezzz if that isn t a big you from the creative assembly devs i haven t seen any other person comment on this other then that one female dev but if that s how the company like to treat the customer base then i don t think i ll be buying another ca game ever again i don t mind the female general forced into my gameplay but i do mind being told if i don t like it mod it out or don t buy play the game it would ve been nice though to have the choice of accepting female generals occasionaly leading your armies rather it being forced apon me and then months later to find my fav game now has a random poli tical agender 5 years after releasing their game
