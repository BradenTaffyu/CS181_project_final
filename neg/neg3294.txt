2018 as much as i love this game i cant recommend this game to anyone who excpects to buy a good ww2 strategy game and get what they want because its a strategy game but its becoming less and less about ww2 and more about wierd random my main concern with this game isn t the incredibly dumb ai thats still hasn t been fixed after 2 years not with paradox s blatant cash grab dlc policy where they lock core features behind a paywall blitz button on battle planner not the unecessary addition of alt history content which we didn t ask for or even the fact that they haven t fixed teleporting ing airplanes my main concern with the game is that paradox has pretty much forgoten about its core audience who want a good ww2 strategy where we can play as germany and have a somewhat plausible ending where i don t have to kill off every damn country that is in the allies before they surrender or play as the soviets and have a germany that will actually put up a fight and wont let me just steamroll across itself i know that paradox has somewhat fixed these issues but again you re not really going to see these issues fixed unless you buy their dlc s oh and don t tell me about the free patch paradox has clearly stated that if we are to stop buying the dlc s they will probably stop developing the game all together so in other words if you excpect the free patch to come around you actually have to buy the dlc s or paradox will just stop fixing the game you see paradox has taken the same path as it did with ck ii and eu iv in that they ll just add more and more dlc s however none of them are addressing the issues nor are they bringing anything new to the table what they re doing is readding mechanics from their older titles and adding these alt history paths so that youtubers like isorrowproductions and drew durnil can make more vids about hoi 4 memes because they generated a lot of interest towards the game and as such created a wider audience that has bought hoi iv don t get me wrong i love those vids as much as the next guy here but i digress as such paradox is now focused on creating more of these weird unplausible alt history content so that the more people will notice the game and generate more revenue the game is now being developed toward a casual audience that will want to witness funny stuff and randomness happen in their games and that s fine but that s not what the game was initially meant to be it will most likey be a very long time and will cost well over 100 dollars worth of dlc just to experience the game that we old fans really wanted to see since day 1 i m sorry paradox but this is just sad and i can t support your decision here i understand that you re a company and that you re supposed to make money but you should have at least followed through on your first promise and deliverd a ww2 that we were actually promised we wanted a hoi that had more features but with a better ui not less features and streamlined gameplay it s clear that you guys are not going to change anything i won t buy any more of your titles until you will follow through and deliver the game that was initially promised to us how can i buy any more of your games if you charge us for the access to the game and then keep charging us more and more to access in game features some of which should have been part of the main game anyways
