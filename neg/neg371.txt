2022 let me just start off by saying i m having a lot of fun with this i waited years for the community to finally say this is a playable game and i think playable is the correct word so here s why you should keep waiting draw distance embarrassing to say the least using a scope to check out what s ahead is not feasible the pop in isn t too bad on ultra how i run it but i ve seen so much more impressive graphical feats with respect to performance out of much more detailed games unfortunately this will be the theme of my review lighting and textures so bad some textures are high res but usually mixed in with terrible low res textures making for more of a mess than an art style pick one guys looking at god rays tanked my fps by half while getting 60 looking in the other direction or when the weather changed unbelievable this game has all the same problems as fallout 4 optimization i touched on this above but it s really hopelessly bad guys i just finished playing through far cry 6 in 4k ultra and never dropped below 60fps for a second i have to play this in 1080p the wide range of framerates you get in this game is truly staggering when just looking around from a stationary position unbelievable settings close and reopen to apply setting takes for ever to tune graphics close and reopen the game to connect headphones can t turn off my bethesda username and use my character name what every button on my keyboard is mapped to a different menu option there s literally no continuity with how you navigate all the countless menus in this game i swear literally every could have been done from the pip boy and follow one set of navigation rules this is game design 101 guys good luck holding 60 in combat ok i m done with the performance stuff base building seems follow quite a flawed set of rules let me do what i want dammit i placed a roof down structural pieces and wasn t allowed to take them apart in the exact reverse order i placed them in broken and annoying monthly membership listen i know it s not a requirement but this game does not deserve to ask for my money with all the flaws listed above seriously guys now the good very friendly and helpful community i met one level 400 on my first day who has been toting me around and giving me plans for stuff which is so nice more fallout that s why i bought this game the novelty of multiplayer fallout is not lost on me being able to show others your creations and share is so important for a game like this i won t mince words when i say this fallout 76 is a good game it s just bad software now if you ll excuse me i m going to try and tune my graphics settings and get my overclock stable wait for this to get better and if you already have the game write bethesda a review outlining the bugs you re having maybe they ll listen remember we aren t getting a script extender this time around boys
