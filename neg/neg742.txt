2016 a lot of good points too bad that for one improvement from the previous games there s two or three regressions in different domains yes the game accumulates a lot of pros and in almost every domain the new artistic direction is awesome the settlement construction is relatively fun the gunplay is finally feeling right and the wasteland is always compelling to explore sadly it ends here in almost every other category the game fails to deliver something even equivalent to fallout 3 which is sad given that almost a decade separates the two games writing writing is the quintessential point in a good rpg or rather was with a storyline that ll make a summer blockbuster sound philosophical a cast of unidimensional characters which includes the pc as bethesda did anything in their power to prevent you from appropriating it and a crippled dialogue system the game looks like the bastard child of an hollywood summer flick and a korean mmo taking the moralizing tone and manichean storyline from the first and the endless randomly generated fetch quests from the latter nothing that you do is actually important to the game world and apparently now the wasteland is so harsh that any npc that is not a villain will automatically appreciate you treat you as a hero and give you freebie hello danse that made me join him on a big operation 3 mins after meeting me and preston garvey that entrusts you the player to liberate the wasteland all by yourself a mere 10 minutes after a scripted action sequence which breaks easily the quests are all prety bland and the same go there shoot everyone bring back the mcguffin again and again no more glimpses of wasteland weirdness no more infiltration no more talking your way out of a situation no more stealh except in combats to rack up a crit or two that s right whatever type of character you play you ll always heroically save the day by killing all the baddies gameplaypositive the fast loot menu is great negative everything else the new stats system is awful and dumbed down and overwhelms you with a lot of choices that don t matter hmmm should i take 5 dmg resist or 5 rad resist and your stats have little to no inluence on the storyline dissociating these two elements further no more low int run where you play a or high charisma characters talking their way out of the most awkward situations most of the mechanics that made fallout a game about survival simply disappeared like weapon durability ammo types damage thresholds and a decent basic needs system the only alternative is a survival mode that is more frustrating than challenging graphicsthe new artistic direction is great with weapons buildings and vehicles appearing more varied and showing more volume everything from the guns you fire to the environment you explore feels heavy and really there ethers from the carboardy models from fallout 3 nv the graphics themselves are good and the new engine performs well even on lower end systems it s because bethesda gave up on this part and used a refurbished id tech as their renderer which is a big step up from their 2001 pipeline even with that everything is not perfect and you need to mess up with the config files to change even simple things like screen resolution or fov not to mention the immense disappointment of 144hz monitor users that con t get the best out of their hardware bethesda doesn t care for both low end and high end hardware users sounds voicesthe environmental soundtrack is great and the choice of radio songs is still good the addition of clasical music is a welcomed idea however the voice acting is very inconsistent and the crappy dialogue system doestn t help making things credible that s a lot of burnt money that could ve went to other departments like q a programming or maybe to hire professional writers instead of the poor lonely intern overall the game disappoints even though it has a lot of good elements if you look for a good fps go ahead but you re warned the game istn t anything more till the moddig scene develops that is
