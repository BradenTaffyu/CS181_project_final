2022 played on give me god of war this game has been one of the most disappointing game i have played in a while i am convinced that those who say this game s combat is well designed either play this game on give me a story or give me a balanced experience the higher you go up in the difficulties the more exaggerated the flaws become first the camera is absolute it is far too close to be able to see around you a lot of people have compared this game to the last of us to the annoyance of the game director cory balrog though this absolutely is a fair comparison for some reason they have chosen a camera angle and fov suited for third person shooters and decided it a better choice than that of the previous games the result is finding yourself dying to enemies outside of the view of the camera instead you need to rely on the red indicators around your body though these are a bandaid fix at best since the indicator turning red does not accurately convey when an enemy is about to attack rather that an enemy will eventually attack in the next few seconds making it rather difficult to time an evade or dodge roll this is made even worse in the troll boss fights the game directors were so insecure with merit of the bossfights themselves that they decided to add a bunch of ranged enemies around the arena making combat tedious in the higher difficulties combat no longer feels rewarding result of the cheap deaths mentioned above no longer do i feel inclined to learn the enemy attack patterns rather just spam runic attacks and try my hardest to cheese the fights the straw that broke the camel s back was the geirdriful boss fight as a result of the poorly choreographed enemy attacks it becomes almost impossible to differentiate between her unblockable strike or her blockable cyclone attack it would not be as big of a deal if you could just time a dodge role for both attacks however for the cyclone attack acts like a homing missile one you dodge roll the first hit making it impossible to my knowledge to dodge all in all there was alot of potential here however due to the poorly designed combat the experience fails at being game play focused and rather jerks itself off with its story
