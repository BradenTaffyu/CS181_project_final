2021 while there is a lot to do just about every mechanic in forza horizon 5 feels disappointingly surface level ai drivatars are a joke season challenges are often impossible due to a lack of quality control a lot of non seasonal challenges and achievements are bugged the devs are banning people for making or using skins with copy written materials on them it s just a bad game it feels like a slapped together asset flip of previous forza games pilled high with pointless gimmicky new mechanics that might as well not be there since they didn t improve the base gameplay at all in fact driving in general feels worse handling is better granted but the dreadful ai together with the terrible matchmaking ruin it unless you love driving around a mostly empty feeling sandbox world or tuning cars please don t buy this it might be better with friends but so is getting punched in the face
