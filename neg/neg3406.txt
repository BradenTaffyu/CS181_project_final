i loved cs 1 for those of us who are not artistically inclined it provided a perfect sandbox to design create truly if you could imagine it you could create it i have almost as much fun shopping for mods as running the simulation yes unlike cs 2 cs 1 tries to be a simulation it was the most unique and satisfying computer game with the possible exception of ksp i ever experienced but it is time to face facts cs 2 will never be superior to cs 1 why first it is not a true attempt at a simulation the idea that if you cant supply your denizens that magic invisible amazon trucks will simple deliver what is needed is just an example i m sure there are other examples but i have better things to do than pick apart the obviously rushed and half baked work the designers did what s the challenge of making a city both functional and beautiful if the simulation doesn t care second this is an ugly game the muted colors building designs etc are drab the resource buildings how farms and mines are laid are downright hideous no corn wheat or barley fields laid out in a nice checkerboard like with mods you get in cs 1 but blobby patches with haphazard buildings strewn all over the place did these guys even bother to look at pictures of farms in europe or the us third modding it should have been a red alarm bell when modding was closed off behind the companies own platform there really is only one reason for it they are going to monetize the out of this product and any modders who are truly the simulation s heroes king leno et al you are tops are going to be frozen out oh you have created 12 different palm trees well forget it we are going to give them 4 and make em pay this will not change they well make sure that any asset mod better than what they want to push down your gullet never sees the light of day you stick with this simulation hold on to your wallet it s going to be a bumpy ride the thing is it all could have been so different they could have easily put this thing together by bringing in the modders paying for the ip they put in to the first game intergrate it with better graphics and ui leave it open on steam to mod and save all those content creators on you tube who were either left twisting in the wind or shown to be shills for an inferior product instead they chose the aaa studio path put out an unfinished mess to save q3 earnings make it as bland and broadly appealing as possible to get the fish hook in as many mouths as they could and monetize the out of it the word tragedy comes to mind i don t write reviews often and never negative ones i m not as cs hater if you look at my review for cs 1 i practically gush but when you take a vibrant engaging simulation and a equally vibrant and engaging community supporting it and destroy them i have to call it out for what it is an example of sloth crassness and greed there is an answer they mat have played me for a sucker in buying the base game but they will never get a dime more from me they will never get me to trust paradox enough to pre order on of their products thinking they they are some not like bethesda ubi soft or any other aaa a holes who would shame a con man fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me if you want to change this behavior just do the same just say no you deserve no empathy if you put your hand on the stovetop a second time and get burned
