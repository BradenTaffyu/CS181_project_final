2021 build your own jurassic park world that s what they told us enjoy our unique campaign story then i fire up the game and play the campaign for it to be a measly 2 hours long and have a story that can be summed up in one sentence i then check sandbox only to see everything is locked behind challenge mode or chaos theory build your park unless you want dinosaurs past the campaign dino s like 8ish out of the 70 roster then go play chaos theory or challenge mode right because marketing a sandbox game mode only to have it locked behind days or weeks of grinding is what we were teased because you have to unlock sandbox mode and things to use in it in minecraft oh wait you don t what about garry s mod no there too hmmm two of the biggest sandbox games and no grind must be they re doing it wrong with all that success that s not where this pain train ends nope by the end i ll be burying my hopes for the jp jw game the community wanted in a soup can so i go to the first recommended mission by the game itself and can t even complete it because of the biggest problem this game has its not about dinosaurs if you want a game focused on dinosaurs or jp jw don t play this i would gladly recommend telltale s jp if it was still up over this despite how much of a train wreck that was but in all reality go grab jwe 1 if you want a game about dino s or jp jw then go to the nexus page for it and download mixed era s for a true limitless sandbox with no grind but i can t even recommend that because it would be giving frontier money after yet another game sold on half truths and out right falsifications so kunze if its not about the dino s or even the franchise that licensed it the franchise that is the childhood nostalgic love of us then what is it about micro managing staff and guests yes that s right the focus is being a manager so if you ever wanted to know what its like to be a manager dealing with angry people only those angry people actively try to murder everyone around them with dinosaurs then i guess this is your game if you re here out of fandom of jp jw and or dinosaurs there is another far better game in development for the latter for jp jw welcome back to waiting better get comfortable so what makes this game so bad oh we d be here all week if i described it in detail so i ll summarize it in pros and cons pros cabot finch the worlds best richard attenborough impersonator dino behavior is actually far closer to an actual animal inside the enclosures dino animations are actually dynamic as promised and diverse from running walking to drinking and eating sleeping hunting they can even fail now and have no awkward line up etc small detail but dino s get scars from fighting paths can cross tour paths finally you can release enough dino s that you can nearly always satisfy their population needs rangers auto fill feeders and scan dino s raptors can climb fences when the power is out and fly boys can break out and attack as well buildings can be moved time controls and the ability to get things started while time is stopped not every herbivore is friendly with others they actually conflict with others that occupy the same place in the natural hierarchy as them nature isn t that kind and this reflects that and honestly i love it no more plant feeders just plants various small quality of life changescons tour paths can t cross each other needing scientists to heal injured dino s extract fossils to sell fossils yeah you need money to sell the things you sell to get money to rest costs 75k after every 4 tasks or they let out the dinosaurs needing scientists but being extremely limited by slots needing scientists but being extremely limited by the money you don t have from needing scientists for everything storms are more frequent always injure some of your dino s are damaging to buildings always guests are micromanagement hell ranger teams can no longer be hired its a ranked research unlock that s far more expensive than another ranger post for one more car carnivores that like each other in cohabitation don t they still kill each other as soon as possible even with plenty of readily available food between another carnivore of the same size and threat they pick killing that over the dozens of easily killed goats for days everything in sandbox has to be unlocked despite the freedom of sandbox being the games biggest advertisement point imagine if minecraft made you unlock the ability to even have a map for sandbox by doing challenges the common cold which almost always turns into pneumonia which almost always affects the dinosaurs with a minimum social requirement of 3 which can t be cured except separating them which promptly results in a break out and dead guests and the only way to keep the dino s from dying is to manually waste 30 minutes reassigning the vet to heal them over and over the game is designed in such a way that if you aren t doing anything it assumes it s because you re trying to farm money and then it proceeds to go out of its way to cost you money with illnesses injuries and storms but in reality you aren t doing anything cause you had no money to do anything with the story there is none you put dinosaur in pen thing happen dino get out dino hurt people dino go back in masrani sounds like a cheesy bond villain boring dialogue except a few moments or lines predictable scripted events are predictable game go make a t rex you bet its gonna break out t rex 1 nanosecond after being put in its pen and the gate opens itself till you repair it its free real estate you wow i am so surprised not being able to play the game without crashing all the time on even the most beastly of computers losing boatloads of progress to crashes far too many more to name conclusion if you want the game for jp jw don tif you want the game for dinosaurs don t unless you re happy with 8 12 species with one skinif you dream of being an under paid over worked manager i guess you could play this instead of working as one at mcburger or wally world and actually get paid instead of paying 60 70 if you are an expert and want the dark souls of economic guest satisfaction management i guess or you could go work at universal and actually get paid instead of paying 60 70 how could the game be fixed besides fixing all of the above give us a real campaign give us a fully unlocked sandbox for those of us the majority of the community and nearly every content creator that play the game to build recreations of the movies or build our own parks or just simply relax and stretch our creativity or simply just relax and watch dinosaurs be dinosaurs in a happy park or nature preserve we make and maintain for them if you absolutely need to have unlocks save the high difficulty unlocks for things that only serve the purpose to be a unique proof of the accomplishment like for example hammond s helicopter for beating a jp1 challenge mode and have dinos and buildings and dino skins be unlockable far easier preferably in an actual proper campaign give us the option to have our sandbox park be a dfw nature preserve where we focus on dino happiness heck make a game mode like that where your goal is to gather threat dino s from the world and safely house or relocate them and focus entirely on dino welfare and getting dangerous dino s contained or back into a proper habitat
