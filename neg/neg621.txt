2017 like the others too many rpg game busting bugs wait for enhanced edition sale more patches this game is bugged from beginning to the final quest serious story broken ending bugs plenty of reporting on forums if you want to ruin it for youself but i recommend avoiding for a while my final conclusion is to wait for a heavy discount and more patches to fix broken bad content my gameplay hours trump most despite being inflated by afking with game running but i ve stuck it out and tried to report as many bugs as possible simply put this is great game potential yet mared by bugs everywhere for a metric patch 3 addressed over 100 features and bugs alone many of which were known for months of early access this makes the game as it stands very hard to enjoy as you don t know what is bugged and what is a feature moreover quests despite being completed correctly still flag as incomplete and thus the game treats you as having not done the stuff you did and this alone is tire screeching for any rpg features are generally much the same as d os1 but again they feel like beta or just bad in some areas and splendid in others dialogue and banter chat log feature has never once functioned to date some fights in game warrant explaination on wtf larian was thinking dreamers portal and most of the status and features require trail and error to get a grasp of ring 6 vitality apparently means this ring gives you constant healing equal to the hp from 7 constitution and each point of constitution give 7 vitality which are your hit points personal preferences aside quite a number of intended features are either frustrating not being able to mouse over enemy debuffs to read description or simply are broken never made it into the game there is a good deal number of dialogues that are only partly voiced meaning that its either more bugs not playing voice script properly or intended that way another example the quest log arguably important is poorly implimented supposing you avoid the bugged logs it doesn t fully complete for each zone it also updates per interaction so if you find a boss then later find a note hinting where the boss is the note will be the top update this results in you not knowing if the quest if still in your current act and thus you will miss out if you leave or if the quest is continued in the next act its guessing game or risk forum spoilers
