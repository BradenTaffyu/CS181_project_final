after 300 hours my overall opinion is the development team at relic took this game and broke it into many little pieces and gave us 20 at launch over the last year they have released quality of life improvements and gameplay features that the team knew were beloved in coh2 and told the community these brand new innovations are coming to coh3 in further updates it feels disingenuous and that s before you get to the story of the game coh and coh2 had some of the best ww2 stories in video games coh3 is written by an mba brained drone who does not care at all about the na campaign the people the tactics or the effect this titanic conflict had on our world they shoehorn in a story that uses the people bengasi as wallpaper the narrator of the story compares the british to nazis and implies that the fighting with them really doesn t matter then we get a story of what the writer really cared about a young activist girl the italian campaign writing is just as poor but without the woke bs while the voice acting is pretty stereotypical the american sounds like a cowboy the brit sounds like a teacher the italian partisan woman is fiery oh my i am glad relic is an indy studio again it means meritocracy will return to their firm and we will get better games content and respect for ww2 and the people portrayed in the conflict overall you shouldn t pay more than 20 for this game
