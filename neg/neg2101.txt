2018 i use to absolutely love this game when i first started to play it was amazing and there were no other games like it i looked forward every day to play it and to a certain extent i still do but now it feels like more of a chore then anything and before everybody says just don t play it you idiot but the problem is like i said earlier theres no other game like its kind ultimately making gaijin just a monopoly for this game genre and make it painful to play for free and punish you if you don t buy anything and before you say yes i ve sunk multiple of hundreds of dollars into this game but i wanted to try it for free and i so i made another account to feel how it was it s completly miserable hats off to anybody who can get anywhere near rank 3 or 4 without premium or a premium vehicle alongside the pay wall gaijin have just pissed in all of the player s mouth disregarding what they ask for and just keep adding new content which nobody needs or wants the majority of the player base will never unlock the new rank 6 or even rank 5 vehicles unless they just heave all of their money towards the game and you want to play planes oh yeah i forgot air rb is completly broken and gaijin hasn t touched it nor cared about it since they launched the game gaijin wonders why nobody plays their game anymore and it s because of their absolute greed of everything that has to do with money do you guys not make enough already and now you re giving an exclusive vehicle to xbox one players that s going to cost 50 60 dollars and some kid who gets it is going to play a game with it and be a detriment to his her team because he s not going to have any planes at that br no lineup and he isn t going to understand the meta at all and probably barely even know how the game works it just kills me on the inside because this game used to be so enjoyable but gaijin couldn t help but to fill their pockets even more and just throw the community away and never looked back
