2022 i enjoyed the game negative reviews can be more helpful though one negative review can t hurt this is like the 3rd revision of the review to shorten it and stuff because these butthurt kids are getting annoying i ll keep the pros really short stress go bye bye killing funny mods are epiccons performance no i can run the game you might not which you might find confusing considering this is some 2d silly looking game if you can t run it lower your simulation settings the base game is rather empty and bland all about creating your stuff or using mods not a problem for me maybe a problem for others to make this a peakier experience get qol mods repetitive you build destroy and kill repeat that s about it really it s like playing with dolls and a few wooden bricks just because you have nothing better to play doesn t mean others don t community not a multiplayer game you d still do well to avoid anything revolving it workshop community tab discussions reveiws all of it it s just children anyway the workshop used to be filled with spam not sure about nowadays i don t play this religiously in short buy game if killing ragdolls funny don t buy it if you aren t interested in that
