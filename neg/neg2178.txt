2023 i used to like this game but the current state of the game is screwed upthe game is a fun multi vehicle fighting experience it could include tanks planes and even battleships however the snail has made a few recent economic changes to the game these changes nerfed silver lion gains and made repair cost and vehicle costs way more expensive normally i wouldn t have a problem with this a challenge is a challenge however this makes silver lion gain almost impossible the fact that you have to repair your vehicles makes it so that you may even go into debt and it doesn t stop there it screws everyone over except premium players people that pay gaijin money get double silver lions and double research points and many more boosts this makes it so that if you want to get remotely close to top tier vehicles you have to pay the snail or grind your life away to this seriously you are better off in a crippling adderall addiction
