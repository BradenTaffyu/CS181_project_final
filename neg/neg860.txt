2018 this game is inherently flawed beyond the bugs there are gameplay issues that speak of something that had a rushed deadline as a note i ve only really ever played through the game on survival difficulty these problems shine through minus the very first one even when i have mods installed difficulty trend you start off with realisitic weapon damages and then it takes 50 shells of 12 gauge to the face to kill a raider with a fully exposed head that s broken very broken weapons that would be considered normal such as something in 5 56 or a laser rifle lest they be in legendary form with a build for the highest possible damage output available through weapon mods become useless once above level forty and you have to start using fully automatic variants which burn through your ammo faster than you can find it on enemy crates or corpses perks the perk in order to be able to transfer supplies between settlements is stupid it is locked behind a charisma level i can understand that you have to be able to woo people into joining your place and make them feel at home but i feel like my intelligence is insulted when i have to get a perk just so that i can tell people to take a bag fertilizer somewhere i think this speaks well of the perk tree gun play when you sight in your mouse sensitivity is about one quarter or one eighth of is is when looking around normally i can understand this from a perspective of making hipfire more viable on a character build that aim fire but for a game that advertises being the new cool fun hip fps where you can play like a tacticool soldier it s a little too ridiculous when the raiders are managing to run across my screen at the speed the insects in the game are supposed to be able to the bugs are supposed to be fast moving and hard to hit but the raiders move about as quickly while maintaining accurate fire and even when they re staying in one place it makes me feel like this youtube video chicken little how to dodge dodge balls like a boss views 16 162 fish uses his dance skills to dodge dodge balls try it when you have dodge ball raiders aren t black ops units they aren t trained on move and fire tactics so what is this bullet velocity is slow at no point in a real life have i noticed an example wherein it takes half a second for a bullet travelling 100m to reach a target requiring two degrees of lead on a target that s a lot of leading the target to a degree that makes it feel like i m shooting an airsoft gun input lag is atrocious compounding the bullet veloctiy problem that makes you have to lead targets worse because you have to account for the time between when you press the mouse button and when the bullet will actually leave the barrel of your gun shooting enemies wasn t intended to be rocket science so why has it become that this comes down to the terrible old engine they ve been using because it cuts down on the work they have to do they need to get a new engine that isn t as or strip this one down recode half of it and then work back up from there variety insert todd howard quote here about painstaking hours there is none they expected the gun modification to account for the lack of guns available they failed hardcore none of the weapons save the 10mm pistol are lore friendly to any previous fallout they did it once they ll do it again in a military installation that has been 200 years sealed and left to dust you find a pipe rifle why why would the creators ever code a possibility that one of the randomly spawned items is soout of place because they didn t have the weapon variety to implement it i like the idea of a few pipe weapons here and there but when that is what an entire raider gang carries especially when in previous fallouts they have carried things that altleast look like they descended from what was at one time a normal firearm it feels like i m in a cartoon world and somebody forced acid onto me genuinely i think black powder weaponry would have been a better step in the right direction than this compare pipe weaponry to fallout 1 s scrappy weapons even new vegas and 3 did better when they included the marksman carbine and assault rifles fallout 2 did even better they had weaponry with h k written right on it genuinely i m not dumb please don t dumb down guns for me calibres are stupid in this way as well i d like to see the technology that increases a gun s stopping power by modifying the reciever is it in the sake of balance why the game is single palyer in the first place dlc sticks out horrendously makes me want to play without it every time i see it survival mode so you took away fast travel you gonna give us mounts or are you just going to be lazy and not accomodate for it not going to add some creative fuel mechanic use fusion cores as fuel for an old junker car own your own vertabird so you don t have to use all of your bos smoke nades to get to the southern part of the map for a lore important quest that makes you question your sanity vehicular customization not going to rip off mad max here are you for real not going to add a hand crank rail car specific to the railroad faction that you can use to get around the map are you serious fallout 2 was more creative than this it was a 2d bitmapped isometric i expect more from a company heralded as the anti ea tl dr whoever put thought into the core aspects of the game was smoking something and it didn t make the outcome better it made it worse go play s t a l k e r
