2023 not finished people make for free mods that this company should have made with the money they got for it at this point they can just pay the people for the mods and include them in the base game with some stability improvements its not worth it without mods so i don t recommend this game only if you can get it for like 6 7 the hours i spent in it was due to the mods that other people made the base game only gave me like 15 hours of interesting game play after that is boring repetitive and no real way to progress almost a year from release and only like 2 updates more maps bug fixes and few other small things its just warband with better graphics i guess a lot of us expected more and rightfully so after seeing what people can do for free with mods
