2018 the outer shell make it appear as a great game especially the atmosphere and the simulation of nature is well caught but in it s core gameplaywise it s a clunky mess pathfinding of the animals is poor tracking them is even poorer there are soundbugs since over a year now and they still are not adressed sound mixing is a catastrophy via the headphones and these are just the top of the iceberg when this game works it s lovely it even kept me distracted from the issues it has for over 200h but the more time you spend with it the more you recognize the messy implementation of things if this was marked as early access i would be more forgiving with this review but what really makes me upset is that the tremendous amount of work this game needs is neclected or rather ignored by the devs instead they are releasing content after content that you ll have to pay for and those are introducing more and more bugs i love the idea of this game but in this state i say no sir
