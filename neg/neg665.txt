2018 unique concept burrowed under ridiculous amount of rngwhat makes a good rogue game is requirment to improve the world is constantly changing but most of problems are possible to avoid or solve if you know how sadly nowadays people keep misunderstanding this concept and try to add as much of random as possible without providing a skill based experience this game isnt exception yeah sure tactics and strategy still add some points to win rates but most of them belong to the great rngesus who decide if you will win or lose trying to be agressive well bad news enjoy your death by lack of defence from some bullet sponge being a risky lurker and make your path tru unidentified rooms few tough enemies in a row mixed with lack of cards will lead to unavoidable death play safe and invest into defence well mobs in most of upcoming rooms will punish you for being a tank there are plenty of ways to do so begining with frail that reduce amount of received defence from cards and ending with hex which add garbage into your pile for each non attack card used etc etc etc most of deaths will be unavoidable and only depend on your luck same for wins tho people dislike darkest dungeon for amount of randomness but in that case slay the spire easily overlaps it dont get me wrong i dont hate this game its intresting yet a bit short in content for its price experience of card game additional plus point for being a ccg without microtransactions mixed with roguelite formula but the problem is it relies on rng way more than enough spices are tasty if there is just right amount of them sadly this meal feature so much of them to make its taste disgusting even if other ingredients used were top tier even if chef spent so much time and effort to make it as much as i want i just cant recommend it
