2020 i have fun with the game but i feel obligated to leave this review as negative until wargaming allow account migration between servers and make it easier to link steam with an existing wargaming account its worth trying out if you have the disk space since it s free and it doesn t even really feel pay to win just pay to progress faster however coming from eu to us the region lock on accounts means i m still playing on eu servers or i have to restart with a new account and lose all progress
