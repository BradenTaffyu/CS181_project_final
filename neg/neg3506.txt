2023 bought the game on sale recently just because i know the game is not worth the 60 price tag story absolutely loved the first games story line and progression however this one was super easy to complete and just felt like i was doing a tutorial the entire time no progression what so ever other than unlocking certain maps and a little challenge here and there but nothing that made me want to keep going back to the story i completed it just to complete it honestly systems i like the addition of a few things like the scientist and obviously having water and air dinos but still seemed to fall a little flat i feel like it is hard to actually build a park since there are very few buildings a good amount of cosmetics but you can just build large amenity centers every so often and have 100 accommodation rating i ll get into the ranger and mvu teams below but i like that they are more useful but it just makes the game annoying having to fill up and resupply constantly and the bugs my oh my the bugs bugs here is where the game really is not worth the 60 price tag there are a ton of bugs with some of the systems the game forces you to use the rangers having to do status checks seems like a great addition at first because it makes you think about the location of where to put them and response time you can place a ranger station in the middle of the pen to automate this but i keep getting constant bugs where the rangers get stuck don t even go to do the task or just never make it to the pen leaving you with dinos you have no idea are dying because they too get stuck i m doing a sandbox map right now and half of my dinos are dying because no status checks and even though they are 100 comfort are failing to find food and they are standing on the food i get the same issues with the mvu units as with the ranger units they know an animal is sick task gets created automatically but they are just sitting back at the base another random event that does not happen often but is super annoying is dinos glitching though fences into another enclosure so you have to tranq the dino and place it back into its original enclosure these bugs are just annoying and when you are trying to build a park and having to constantly manage 50 dinos because they get stuck is just frustrating i don t mind a little bit of micro management but it just gets to the point where you can t enjoy the game anymore hopefully they fix this issue soon even though they said they fixed it and are still working on it
