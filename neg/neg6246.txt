2023 early access review tl dr brilliant game but deeply insulting monetization policy casuals will have a fun ride for some weeks competitive players should either prepare to seriously invest 100 euro per month or don t even start game is an excellent version of easy to play but difficult to master with an addictive core great visuals beautiful art design and incredible strategic depth but when you reach a certain level 500 relevant card drops become increasingly rare while you have to compete against full meta decks to win in the higher leagues of ranked or conquest play mostly you lack 2 3 cards to be on meta for each archetype so you feel close to have the perfect deck but then a completely disrespectful pricing policy kicks in which i haven t seen in any game so far free to play rewards are limited by scarce daily missions so just playing more wont earn you anything the price in virtual currency to get a chance for a card is extremely high and often you just get cosmetics due to very disadvantageous randomization and finally the translated money price to buy the specific cards you want spotlight or bundles is ridiculously high we are talking about up to 100 euro for 1 card here once you see through the system the huge complexity in different in game currencies is not a gimmick but pursues the sole purpose to incentivize you to spent the big money on the one card you need for comp play if you listen to streamers there are player who spent several thousands of euro on the game to be capable to play on meta given the current high rate of cards added per month and the extremely slow rate of getting cards due to price and randomization you basically will never be able to play on a high level without investing huge sums to keep up with the meta summary for some casual mobile play great game competitive gamers be prepared to feel insulted by this monetization here
