2020 i ve had fun in this game quite a lot actually the combat isn t bad character building is very free perhaps too free and the quests at times have some great interconnections that make them interesting so why would i not recommend it simply put it s really really shallow there are only a handful of skills for each class and your class doesn t really matter since you can pop a point or two into any category at any time and use the vast majority of the skills for that class this detracts severely from character builds in that pretty much every character can use what ever they please so you can effectively only have a build if you limit yourself purposefully beyond that gear gear is by and large randomly generated so if i want to play a mage type character that armor that requires intelligence 14 and has a lot of magic armor looks pretty good until you see that it buffs strength a stat largely useless to you this is a reoccurring issue over the course of the game struggling to find any gear your character can actually use there are some static gear pieces in the game that range from completely useless for everyone to unbelievably overpowered the latter of which always have very specific stats that lock you into a play style completely nullifying the open design of the character building that brings me to my next point the skill balancing it s hardly even there some skills are consistently one shot ko s whereas other skills with the same cost will do something maybe the point is that the complete lack of attention paid to the skill functions detracts even further from what is truthfully a rather restricted number of skills already for an up to 4 player co op rpg and often results in multiple people spamming the same skills because those are the ones that do something this is all to say the character building aspect of the game while at first appearing polished and interesting is absolutely diluted by a complete lack of structure anyone can use anything they want at pretty much any time while half the skill roster goes untouched as for the quests in the game the vast majority of what i d call the side quests boil down to go here find this thing go here kill this thing or go here realize you need an item theorize the item s possible involvement with another quest based on the information you ve gained from characters books and carefully hidden documents then realize the item was never related to this and actually is sitting in a ditch on the other side of the map that last one gets pretty specific so let me explain there s a division of quests in this game those that apply to progressing the main quest and those that are separate the first two go here s i listed generally apply to the former while those involved in the main quest are more so the third quests are linked together just enough to convince you they re intertwined just for you to by chance maybe stumble upon what you need to do with no direction and see it s completely unrelated it feels as though two or three entirely different teams put the quests into this game with no communication between them and it makes all of it frustrating considering the story it s honestly pretty bland there s some interesting lore given here and there and the divinity series is one in which i m actually quite fond of the lore but i could not have cared any less about any of the characters in this game they have dialogue usually repeated constantly the voice acting is good but they re not much better than lampposts in fact most of the story is now you re here in a place that was never mentioned figure out what you re supposed to do without any direction at which point you promptly stumble upon something without context just to get a quest in your log that tells you to do something you didn t even know was a thing and still don t have context for but which you stumble around looking for because you want that sweet sweet experience so you can level up and progress your build until you realize you don t have a build because you can pretty much use everything freely it s just garbage not to mention it s a good bit shorter than it has any right to be being completely separated between four different acts that all take place on their own small landmass can t be traveled between each other freely and have no consequence between them to the point where dead characters regularly show up in the future with no memory of what happened previously and that s not even in the scripted events to sum up the game it s enjoyable at first but later reveals itself to be a compounding mess of different elements that really don t have much shine on their own and feel horrible together 3 of my 4 campaigns were with friends only one ever got completed and the one where i was solo got boring really quickly also it s really buggy like everyone is in different places on their screens kind of buggy especially act 4 borderline unplayable at times
