2015 they have a good game here i say that as someone who s played for what is honestly years now starting all the way back in 1 27 has the game worn on me a little most likely but what i think has happened is gaijin saw money and got greedy progression is my main complaint the progression way back when i started playing was nice you d play for a week and unlock a plane or two and you d have something new to play with with patch 1 37 they changed the entire progression model claiming you d be able to get down the line faster than ever that was a lie now you could play an entire month and would maybe unlock a single aircraft then it got worse gaijin slowly reduced the experience you recieved from your aircraft upped the experience cost of everything and charged more for premium vehicles with every major update they would put more obstacles in the form of more vehicles some barely historic normally a game that adds content like that would be great but when it s used to extend the grind to later tiers it becomes a chore the progression is a joke now if you were to start today you might see a jet in about 18 months that s a long time to dedicate to what feels like a rapidly declining game overall though the gameplay is still reasonable for the most part aircraft fly and fall apart convincingly and tanks feel properly heavy like they should it s got a solid core game the biggest issue is the actual grind and when a game starts to feel like work is really when you should drop it would i pay any more of my hard earned money to these developers probably not and if i do that time is a long ways away when the game undergoes radical changes would i recommend this game in it s current state absolutely not
