2022 perpetual micromanagement nightmare like they just added this fuel consumption mechanic for no reason now some tasks are automated but they re the ones you actually would want to do which i have to do anyway because the units don t do their job in any time efficient manner this is way worse than the first gameedit so obviously this was unfair when i wrote it at 5hrs in however it s worth noting my initial reaction was to be frustrated as the early game locks you out of better resources that really force you to micromanage fuel i did find the core game fun once it opened up a bit with other game modes the system of research scientists is way improved and i had fun building up my menagerie however i still can t recommend this game because i had to abandon my save from an almost game breaking bug the aviary bug understand that four months after release flying dinosaurs still do not work and will ruin your park they get bugged out so they will starve to death and can t be removed and the buildings can t be removed i posted about this problem and received responses from the devs that amounted to an in game workaround which did not actually work i can t understand how such a big wing of the game pun intended just doesn t work and will ruin your game but they just carry on and are releasing paid dlc instead of fixing the bugs status quo these days but you should vote with your wallet
