2018 tldr used to be a fun game to play with friends but it s now unplayably slow the geniuses that made this such a successful game are gone in their place are a maintenance team that is just messing up everything they touch they keep removing the features that made the gameplay interesting they keep locking down things to prevent modders from fixing themi already was suspicious there were idiots in charge when they started messing with the names of the governmental ethics to foam pad the terminology this has all the hallmarks of when a company decides to windows vista their product it feels like they fired th geniuses hired half price programmers and then told the new people just remove random features of the game until the codebase is simple enough for you to work on recent changes in jump drive mechanics have made this so slow that it s unplayable as just an in your spare time kind of thing you basically have to dedicate multiple entire days because they remade the core unit movement mechanics so much slower before you go i ll just get a mod for that yes i tried that it doesn t exist and can t exist they ve coded those mechanics in such a way that modders can t touch them they ve also started having remarkably big updates like so many of these modern games do i haven t been playing since the game came out i got onboard later i played this off and on up until a few months ago
