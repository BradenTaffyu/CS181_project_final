2022 the game in terms of combat and graphics is better in every way then warband in terms of strategy relations and progression this game is a mess if warbands characters were 2d cardboard made of carved turnip then bannerlords are a hive mind of 1d monowire the lord relations are shared in the clan and none of them have any personality what so ever you can and will be friends with everyone you cant step on any toes or make any enemies its hard to get people to hate you and romancing a women in this game is abysmal in warband you had to appeal to her personality read her poetry visit often now you just have to pass some of the worst speech checks in video game history some of the worst rng i have ever seen the economy is busted making money is easy and horribly hard passive income doesnt exist you will never make enough to support multiple warbands and garrisons smithing makes millions and is super tedious the devs havent even added workshop levels yet but the text for it still exists in game in warband towns were a big deal now three of them cant support a warband the battles are just better in every way except that armies are too common the marshall calling up the lords of the realm and everyone s colors coming together as one was a big and a fun one it was exciting the big battles were confusing because of the different colors and it was better for it some marshalls werent respected and no one would come and if you did hang around them you would be appreciated more when lords didnt show up to your army or refused to help it was infuriating it was really good and an army was the only way to crack a city i remember taking a city with my army just in time and the enemy army investing the fortress we were in and we almost starved because the city was so low on supplies and the enemy army knew this so we had to sally out and break out we won by barely and in the meantime most of our villages were sacked it was a massive mistake it was so much fun so there were small battles all over and large armies maneuvering around eachother trying to find a weakness or advantage before committing to battle now they throw their men at eachother now its color coded death stacks all the time small scale combat doesnt even exist anymore even minor lords will have toops in the 100s cities change hands daily having to find speical horses to upgrade my troops is painful and stupid i dont have to find armor or weapons why do i have to find horses at least make them more common most i ever found was 10 in a town and the horsemen die in droves valandian lands also have two horse villages total smithing is having to rgn your way through to make you end game weapon takes so long that you will have mid game weapons in the end game the parts should be tied to level not rng i have a maxed out smith who cant make a damn throwing spear there are no boats despite them being very clearly planned with several large bodies of water in the game sturgia is not a viable faction and dies every single time because of this the skill system is a massive grind and no real fun you arent making a fairy tale or climbing a social ladder to become a prince you are instantly accepted by most lords and land is dolled out generously all in all i dont have a single moment of this game that i remember or feels special i have dozens of memories from warband from lords i made friends with ladies i wooed lords i hated ladies who spurned me lands i took losses i recovered from battles won battles lost battles that i won but lost the war and battles that won the war entirely my first town taken and given to someone else my first town granted my first revolt against the king and my first game won i have none of that with bannerlord it all drains into a pile of grey goop of chainmail and shield infantry not a single moment to be found except one battle on a bridge that was because my reinforcement would spawn on the wrong side of the bridge this game has fundamental flaws the game is fun but the same kind of fun as a cod game grey goo of dopamine drips the special stuff was sacrificed for mass appeal and for half ass ck2 dynasty mechanics and thats the devs choice for a game i joined the beta for bug hunted and reported for bought early and supported it through its hellish development i waited nearly a decade i am disappointed despite my support this game wasnt made for me it was made for mass appeal i feel slapped in the face first the paid mod rip dlc now this its the devs choice they very clearly dont give a damn about their community with their abandonment for mass appeal and how awful and rude they were during their deceitful development of this game its their choice and its mine to scorn them back if all you want is endless battle and killing that doesnt mean anything larger this is a fun game the multiplayer is going to be great and so will the mods but as a long time fan to long time fans it not only doesnt live up to the famously memed hype so hyped that someone took themselves hostage to have it be released ut spits on the hype the fan base and spits on the old time fans for even being excited and keeping the momentum going
