2016 early access review a great concept for a game clever and well executed you really feel the exhilaration and anxiety of exploring an alien ocean this wonderful game is hamstrung by a terrible development team who have been attempting to solve their coding problems for the past year the worst example of this is the fact that in a game where the more you explore the larger your savefile grows if you explore 50 of the map you will have a 1 gigabyte save file that takes over 5 minutes to load as well as extended framerate drops after spawning as the entire game world is frontloaded building a base is a joke attempting to create multiple bases or a large complex will cause your framerate to drop below 10 no idea why perhaps the bases are being rendered despite being offscreen my framerate at the start of the game is above 100 i get frustrated and give up after it drops below 25if the coding problems are ever fixed i may return to playing the gamefor reference my computer specs are far above recommended i7 4770k 16 gb ram gtx 760 game installed on a ssd to boost loading speed
