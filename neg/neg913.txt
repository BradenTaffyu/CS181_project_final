2019 seriously this review is late but whatever i ve played the game a lot so you d think there is content here no there is no meaningful content in this game the entire experience is a shallow gameplay loop of doing mission board quests over and over in obviously level designed dungeons the game is so gamey that it doesn t ever feel immersive to explore locations the dialogue is as you all already know 1 yes 2 kind yes 3 lol i m a sarcastic 4 no but actually yes so questing is bad level design is boring dialogue is bad how s the plot there worst main plot line in any betheseda game the damned main questline of skyrim was more engaging than this pile of dribble and what makes it worse it that it implements the factions into the main story instead of them being a natural yet separate part of the world companions are almost good some even likeable but their friendship meter is time gated behind pointless timers that prevent you from befriending someone in a couple of hours instead having to spend over a dozen hours with them to get their perk too many settlements preston missions are more mission board no one cares over abundance of settlements makes it so there is less space for actual towns with noteworthy npcs and interactions 3 towns 4 if you count bunker hill which i don t vault 81 diamond city and goodneighbor sure faction bases function like towns but not really they are so one dimensional and uninteresting that they might as well be just another pitstop to sell your junk at because your merchants are out of money oh an another place to pick up mission board quests yipee i m not mentioning bugs because they don t matter this is a pc review just install player patches bethesda won t fix them oh no no no that would cut into their bottom line spending a few bux on their employees fixing code too much money i ve played too much of this garbage i ve modded it to a playable state and had some fun with it but its terrible all i can hope for is that the next core bgs title isn t going to be as bad as this on a side note lmao at anyone who actually bought fallout 76 you got scammed shouldn t have trusted them enough to buy a game you can t mod and fix yourself anyways i m done ranting game gets a low number much higher number i don t care bethesda game studios fix your games
