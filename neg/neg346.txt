early access review love this game but it is unplayable in its current state people with 500 gear score just decimating timmy lobbies because there is no matchmaking system so new players don t even get a chance to learn or experience the game and ironmace instead works on buffing classes that are very powerful already warlock and nurfing classes that don t even work properly yet druid or have working gear to use which by the way runs the entire game so i just have to sit here and play with 50 gear score barely 2 green items and get a lobby full of purp and legendary 450 gear score teams in short don t play this wipe if your new or trying to learn this game you will want to quit in a few matches which is very sad because i want this game to succeed and would love an elevated player base not just people wiping out entire new player lobbies with 10 000 k kits
