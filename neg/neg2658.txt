the only reason i keep playing it is because there are no other games worth while right now you can get hit by a tank you can t see even though its 50 in front of you just because their sighting system is garbage i wish war thunder had a tanks only no planes mode because their sighting system is much better and they have a tow rope to assist friendly tanks that are flipped over only would recommend to console players so they can see how good wot used to be and how far its fallen i m going to go try armored warfare now
