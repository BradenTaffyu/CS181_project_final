2022 i have tried to like this game but modern day total war games are complete feces compared to the old ones i have never once felt like i ve ever been outsmarted or outmaneuvered by the cpu they are just allowed to do things you aren t my army will move 1 inch across the map per turn but the enemy army can move an entire commandery worth of distance and block any move i m trying to make they will always win if you delegate the battle even if you have superior forces you will just play musical chairs with unguarded cities you are limited by how many armies you can have doesn t matter if you can afford them or not you have to be a certain rank to be able to field more lazy programming again the computers soldiers have more hit points and armor than yours to simulate increased difficulty my troops will break and run if their shoes become untied but the enemy unit will have 6 guys left and still fighting don t buy games from this company they are the same ca from 20 years ago graphics are the only effort put into modern games
