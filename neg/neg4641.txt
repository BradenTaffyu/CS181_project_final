2016 after putting a combined 300 hours between civ 4 and civ 5 i just dont see how this is the best civ game let alone game of the year to begin you simply can not suave over any ai going to war or trying to trade almost all ai s end up denouncing you for one thing or another whether that be too little or too much expansion under 25 turns mind that you are guarenteed suprise war under 50 turns by atleast 2 ais although a plus for game mechanics the ai actually attacks you once a suprise war is declared on you the ai is not penalized by any other ai for warmongering and is almost always friendly with every other ai if you take just one city from an ai who declared war on you the game is over diplomatically for you this holy war or formal war the penalties are most certainly not moderate but just as egregious as surprising your enemy in my honest opinion the ai mechanics are as sporadic and uncontrollable as civ 2 back on windows 2000 you simply cant talk to an ai secondly im running an i6700k with 16gb ram and a gtx 1070 on decent max resolution but not ultra and this game by turn 100 just slows to crawl im talking 30 to 60 second turn time waiting after reading the forums and googling it looks like im not alone lastly religion has still not been ironed out fully but just expaned on since civ 5 while i will give credit they have come along way since civ 4 and by not automatically founding judaism sadly ill probably end up playing more of civ 5 still to date then i will civ 6 unless i see some more ai resurfacing unfortunately this is the first civ game i will not recommend
