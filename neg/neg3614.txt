2020 early access review i ve been playing this game since alpha 10 12 i can t tell you exactly who i heard this from so i can t exactly quote who it came from but ever since i heard it i just never stopped thinking about it while playing this game it went along the lines of 7 days to die used to be a building game with survival elements and now it s a survival game with building elements and honestly i couldn t agree more my biggest point of contention of this game is the devs seem to have a direct investment in keeping you from having fun and ruin player choice everything has to be a tedious seems to be their game design looting has had the fun taken out of it because now if you don t have a specific game stage score you ll be finding nothing but blunderbuss s and terrible stone tools you ll be going though a kick ass poi that had all kinds of things to tear you down and you manage to get to the top of the tower even with all those zombies for what that s right some paper some cloth and if you re lucky a handful of 9 mm ammunition that wouldn t even be enough to kill a fat zed with what you have access to what s worse is their game design in a sandbox game seems to be directly opposed to what makes a sandbox a sandbox in that it forces you to play a specific way no longer are bases underground viable because now zombies arms are pretty much drills made to shred land like paper don t like the horde and decide you re gonna make a run for it well they will make dogfood out of you or vultures will be eating mexican food before the hoard cause they are rocket propelled got a little bit of an investment in a minibike or you may have gotten the big lieges because now you re sporting a kickass motorcycle well too bad cause vultures now get a 300 speed boost to specifically make you have a bad time cause why cause they don t want you to play that way that s why they also increase fuel consumption because red moon makes engine go burrr touching on that the goal of these devs seems to be heavy on taking away player choice wanna spend you re time just leveling and building by not going to the trader well even though you have a huge investment in a skill tree you can never get tier 6 weapons tools legit can t make em either have to find or buy them why because the devs want you to play one specific way i get having an image for making your game your reality but man it s a sandbox time and time again they take away options there is now only an optimal way to play the game no making your own story and i hate how they made zombies so intelligent to bline for the weakest part of the game not because it makes it harder but because they are zombies shambling corpses another thing i d like to touch on in this review is that the devs seem to really want to make the game a chore for instance alpha 19 added a little feature in which if you re driving a vehicle your hunger drain rate increase i have a question and it s similar to y turns out it had 0 drain beforehand putting your foot on the gas still drains more tho which is weird there s no point in doing that other than to just stick a middle finger to the player base and they love to do that at this point the game is more about babysitting than it is about zombies seriously you need iron gut because the food water drain is just obnoxious i can go on and on about my issues about the game i just can t recommend it to anyone at this point the enjoyment factor has decreased a ton
