2022 as an avid fan of tph i was very excited for the newest iteration the only thing stopping me from playing it on release was that i knew someone had already planned it for me as a christmas gift now that the time has come and i ve given it a try i have to say i am sorely disappointed the game is not in itself bad but it comes as a major step down from tph s management systems and turns into a glorified idle game the good the animations the graphics have that classic tph charm and the animations are numerous and enjoyable it s obvious there was love put in the detail with even the smallest interactions and it makes for an amusing way to pass the time as you wait for classes to finish the training system while i didn t quite understand it at first once i got the hang of it i realized the training system is much easier and more streamlined than tph the humor and radio the radio is entertaining to listen to albeit a bit repetitive once you ve heard all the shows the classes and item descriptions are unique and come with a humorous flair that adds a nice amount of flavor text to the game the building being able to build the campus buildings themselves is a nice addition to the game and can add a bit more complexity i especially like the option to buy plots with or without the buildings included so those who prefer just interior like myself don t have to worry about the buildings while giving the freedom of building to those who enjoy it the meh relationships the introduction of relationships both platonic and romantic is an interesting choice it makes it a bit more entertaining to watch the students interact with each other become friends fall in love but as your campus starts to grow beyond 20 or so students it becomes hard to keep track of them much less care about any of them individually even if you do find some you grow attached to i had a particularly funny gay clown couple often show up at the forefront of my game they re gone forever in 3 in game years that go by quite quickly making it simply not worth the time or effort the requests i ll expand on the bad part of this in a minute but the reason this starts in meh is because they re pretty much completely optional despite being an integral part of the gameplay you can give them what they want or don t it doesn t really matter a student wants a decorative poster better buy one or they ll get upset except they won t a student needs an item for an assignment better get it for them or they ll fail except they won t the difference fulfilling the goals makes is completely negligible the bad the ui ugly and cluttered the many many tabs and pages in tpc tell you the same information repackaged in different ways there are graphs and charts now and while that seems useful the information tells you what exactly most of it is simply not helpful and the sheer amount of it gets in the way of looking at anything that could be of use the management dumbed down significantly since tph the idea of a management sim is completely lacking here you pick the overall course that the students take but that s pretty much it you can t pick the specific classes they take you can t edit the schedule you have no control over what the students take and when perhaps they intended for it to be a more laid back game but instead it goes too far and becomes boring instead of relaxing the requests good god the student requests they re never ending and absolutely relentless you can dismiss one for whatever reason lack of money lack of kudos and it ll be back within two minutes usually less this is the meat of the gameplay so if you choose to decline the requests you ve got literally nothing to do each request along with the monthly income statement pauses the game and gives you a full screen popup with a description of what they want the gameplay tying back into the lessening of management responsibilities the gameplay is simply lacking you build the rooms it tells you to hire the staff it tells you to and click start for the next in game year your students go to their classes rest in the dorm party hard in the student lounge and absolutely inundate you with inane requests as stated above buy a poster buy a machine rinse and repeat that is essentially the game let it run buy what the students ask you to and sit back and watch the students will get assignments they ll fulfill on their own and you get to watch a little bubble appear above their head and fill up to give you the illusion that something has happened you can assign a specific student extra tutoring if you wan t or they ll go on their own without your intervention there s simply not much for you to do beside building room after room with the same recipe regardless of the class as harsh as my review may seem i really wish there was a meh option rather than completely not recommending it my expectations going in were clearly for a completely different game than the one they wanted to make and once i could get used to the difference in the type of game i was playing it s not really all that bad i can play it for a while and enjoy it though perhaps not as long as i could binge a session of tph for what it is essentially a glorified idle game with no real challenge definitely wait for a sale and know what you re going into before buying it
