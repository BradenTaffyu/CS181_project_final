2014 this game is has a lot going for it beautiful graphics interesting and dynamic historical era to use having army legion traditions and getting to name them a well laid out globalal map lots of factions and sub factions limiting of special agents the focus of trying to make battles not always be sieges including amphibious assaults and navel battles however for everything this game gets right it truly fails at its core game play i will briefly bring up the following flaws game feels void of any meaning customization many bonuses are so arbitrarily useless its unclear as to why they are included diplomacy is basically a throw gold at it till they like you political systems is bare bones and uninteresting user interface in battle does not feel refined or aesthetically pleasing many ai tactics are utterly similar or make a larger battle line if they can and march forward unsatisfying campaign ending unrealistic end game goals tech takes too long is fairly linear and uninspired and also gives a lot of things that feel like they should be standard lastly that was all based on the merit of the game by itself now does this game live up to any predecessor game of the total war series that i ve played no not even close
