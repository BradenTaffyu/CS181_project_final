2022 early access review do not buy this game it s a shell of a game full of bugs crashes and cut features that were promised in the original development logs and trailers these developers took peoples money on a promised game before significantly reduced the scope after release if you want to play the game as intended promised there is was a modding community but hold your horses the tw development have ignored the modding community breaking any and all mods every single patch this has driven away the mod community althogether this isn t no man s sky bad nor cyberpunk 2077 bad this is far worse
