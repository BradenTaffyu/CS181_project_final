tldr short term game is fun awesome long term game is pay to win w egregious micro transactions wish i didn t spend money on it i m currently sitting at collection level 6680 with hundreds of hours in this game 100 on steam w way more on mobile this game is addicting as hell and fantastic when you first begin playing it s honesty one of the best mobile games out there and i d recommend it in the early stages you can go a good distance early on without spending any card rarity is broken down into tiers in this game with 5 being the highest most difficult to obtain think new release cards this game does an excellent job at luring you in allowing you to unlock sweet new heroes and card variants which in turn opens up all new meta strategies this is the game play experience until you unlock all tier 3 cards giving you a free card each week until you eventually claim them all once all that remains are tier 4 5 cards is where things start to go south gameplay changes drastically as these are the cards that are only available in the shop or battlepass it becomes frustrating because these cards are so meta changing they immediately alter the dynamic of the game once you start encountering opponents who have them you simply have to have them if you want to be competitive the game truly becomes a grind as the only way to unlock new cards at this point to save up enough in game currency tokens for the shop but you can t buy tokens outright oh no that d be too easy the only way to get tokens is to continue upgrading your existing cards which require additional currencies boosters credits to raise your collection level unlocking minuscule rewards along the way rewards have gotten worse over time as they re now fluffed with things like avatars conquest tickets etc the only alternative to the grind is to to spend buying the battlepass or dropping on gold in turn using that to purchase more boosters credits to keep running up your level the microtransactions in this game are straight up predatory with the worst usually being a 99 bundle for a single card variant along with enough tokens to purchase 1 additional card in the shop not gonna lie i ve thrown a couple hundred at this game trying to chase cards unlocks in hindsight it absolutely wasn t worth it as much fun as it is landing that new card something bigger better always come along
