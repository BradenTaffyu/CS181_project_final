2019 as far as sim feel goes it does what it sets out to do but is console at heart i feel this industry is due for a huge bubble burst is it too much to ask to have a game complete and working as advertised my journey with this game bought into ea early access day one gamble vr and optimization controls etc all terrible waited months for the 1 0 with maybe 20 hours play 1 0 releases and vr a major feature was removed on release from the store page whats even better is that they still have vr included and it is god awful dont buy for vr right nowon top of that there are so many bugs what are we as consumers what are you as developers honestly what game are we playing i buy you fail then blame me for whining the free market is saturated with incompetence and especially this industry dont release the game if it aint ready what sort of competent company whoever made decisions releases a game like this after putting in through ea to ensure quality nonetheless wow wow
