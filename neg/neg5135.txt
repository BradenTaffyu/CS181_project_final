2016 great game but the first real dlc is coming and it s 20 dlc for a single race their justification is that it has more content than a normal dlc because they had to make more animations for the new units meanwhile for 20 you can get witcher 3 which offers a hundred hours of gameplay yeah no 20 for one race is absolutely unacceptable they also charged 3 for blood 3 for a 7mb patch that adds some almost invisible particle effects don t buy this until you can get it and all the dlc on sale probably months from now show ca that their abhorrent price policy isn t okay show the game industry that this anti consumer crap won t be tolerated
