2016 from where i m standing the game plays like it s in early access i got my money s worth but the game is broken in its current state and i m done playing it for now i ll change my review if these issues are addressed huge chunks of features for example respect tile resources under the sector management are completely broken and do nothing i won t even begin to list them all but the whole factions and rebellions system is completely dead on arrival slaves can t revolt because they haven t fleshed out the design for how slavery revolts will work yet or so we are told so is there a faction you don t like just enslave their pops the ai ignores deadly late game crises that become unstoppable when they are not dealt with quickly and would probably be way too incompetent to handle them even if they didn t ignore them if these crises don t happen in your corner of the galaxy you d better vassalize a path to the crisis because basic diplomatic needs like military access are impossible without war speaking of which the vassalization mechanic is completely broken any empire can be vassalized with 60 warscore which makes conquering the galaxy comically easy ai neightbors usually just sit around and act passive some expand more than others but with the exception of fanatical purifies who will attack nothing interesting really happens throughout the course of a game and you will choose who to attack on your terms the early game is interesting the first time you play it after that not so much compared to civ eu4 dw pick your game the only way to win is through conquest of the galaxy no diplomatic scientific means etc once you colonize more than 5 7 planets the rest will go into sectors which are ai governened unfortunately the sector management ai is completely incompetent it builds and then immediately razes farms some times and other times sits on huge stockpiles of resources and doesn t build anything while your pops sit there severely underproducing because they are working a tile without buildings the above problem wouldn t be so bad except as you get to hard or impossible difficulty your technology cost scales to your population so for example a large empire has 900 tech cost so these suboptimized sectors are a huge technology liability hard and impossible difficulties give artificial 50 and 100 bonuses to all resources including research so sectors become a huge technological liability and in order to keep research parity on hard you willl micromanage every planet after they fix the most glaring problems the random events crystalline alien lifeforms etc are extremely fun on the first playthrough but quickly become repetitive
