2023 sideways thumb this game is almost good the action gameplay is perfectly good smoother and better graphics than previous fallouts while many of the companions are annoying a few of them piper nick valentine are downright charming and i loved having them in my party but the rpg part just felt very insubstantial you have a few options in sidequests here and there and can choose which factions to advance in including all of them but there s really very little in the way of meaningful choice until the last couple hours of the game at which point i don t think it s a spoiler to say you are forced to choose one faction to support consequently it s really only in that last couple hours of the game that the game feels like your presence there matters otherwise you re just sort of murder hoboing your way through an endless series of little building dungeons and while the enemies may change from raiders to supermutants to robots ultimately you re just walking in shooting everything to death picking up the macguffin and delivering it to the next checkpoint the dlc at least offers that triumverate faction option before the end of the game and pleasantly in a more open fashion this allowed me to choose to protect all 3 factions in the far harbour dlc albeit through some mechanical machinations and destroy all three in the nuka world dlc because slavers must die but the game simply doesn t care about your choices aside from the irrevocable faction choice e g the brotherhood of steel now attacking me on sight after i chose to support the railroad as my primary faction your decisions bear no interesting consequence there s no person you saved that shows up 20 hours later as a key plot point no global memory of your actions even the end credits are generic whereas in previous fallout games there would be a little slideshow talking about the results of your various choices here there s a little generic ending video because none of your choices matter it s not a bad game the dungeon loop is compelling perks are fun plenty of weapons and mods and upgrades and a big world full of locations to explore and as mentioned a couple great companions you can bring along for the ride i enjoyed playing the game and unlike some other games that i feel more ambivalent about i was always happy to play fallout 4 and never felt like i was slogging through i had fun i wanted to play but finishing it up tonight when i ask myself if it was a good game the absence of almost any meaningful choice or end credits that acknowledged my affect on the world made the whole experience feel a little hollow perhaps it s unfair to say the game isn t good it would be more accurate to say it s a good and fun open world game where you kill things and level up and get perks it s just not a good rpg or i guess more relevantly for me not a good fallout game of the type i wanted when i eagerly buy a fallout game
