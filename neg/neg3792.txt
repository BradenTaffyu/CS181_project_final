early access review this game was ok it was cheap on sale you d buy it with your friends for couple dollars if not cheaper locally and spend your time with your friends wasting it on 7d2d it s not a good game combat is meh there is no story or characters to talk about it s not a fun game by itself this game is just a way to waste time and i am not shaming anyone out of needing something like that after a mentally tiring day but 25 was already too expensive for a game like that and now devs are releasing it for 45 conan exiles is 40 and it s a complete game ps condolences to console victims customers who need to buy the game again
