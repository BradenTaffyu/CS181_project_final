2018 arma 3 is great lots of different mods servers to play on you can have tons of hours of fun what is not great is that they getting greedy and releasing tons of dlc now they cost more then the game it self i always though bohemia interactive was about quality but now its about money as all the other companys they also add the dlc items ingame so you kinda get f if you don t own them so basicly the whole game cost 110
