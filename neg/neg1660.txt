2020 i am saying this for the people that already have this on originfrom all that i ve seen despite me having the base game on steam and buying the dlcs from my previous experiences with origin it doesn t matter it will say you have the dlcs but because they aren t on steam you cant use them ea is really unnecessary with their expensive dlcs that aren t even that good tbh lets be real 500 bucks for dlc that isn t even better than sims 3 is kinda upsetting but they dont even let you move your dlcs to steam ea have pity on people s wallets please this is really mean if you change this later thank you great but honestly if you don t no skin off my back done buying your stuff if you already have this game on origin stay there
