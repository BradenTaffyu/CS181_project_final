game unreasonably pricey more of a commitment for new players to get into they re practically selling solely to their fan base more than new players no one would waste 200 on getting the full hoi4 experience game should be 20 and dlcs should be 5 each current new dlc should be no more than 10 15 this is all in cad i love this game but the negative review is because of the issue above this game is not worth its non sale price stop selling to your fan base stop scamming your fan base sell to everyone once again the game is ridiculously priced so if you own the game please add a negative review stating this problem so hopefully it gets fixed
