marvel snap is fun fast paced and almost never ending efforts to add new vfx and voice lines for cards are appreciated unfortunately that s where most of the praise ends while the core gameplay elements are addicting the handling of almost everything outside of matches is below standard season pass cards only available through real life payments are incentivised to be overtuned in order to sell the season pass this is nothing new for a mobile game but it also comes with the issue that season pass cards conveniently tend to get nerfed or changed when the season they were in ends those that don t purchase it are at a disadvantage have less options during the month and those that do may end up with remorse when it eventually gets nerfed cards are often adjusted right before near the time season pass cards are introduced in order to make the promotional card even more appealing this leads to once niche or even balanced cards getting either reworked or gutted only to be left once the season is over and a patch is made fixing the season s cards spotlight system generates fomo as potentially meta cards are only easily available for a week before rotating out with the next time they will be available unknown likely months before they show up again meta defining cards that get released heavily favours the spending of an already hard to acquire resource i e one spotlight key a week if the player does all their daily missions in order to not feel behind while those without the guarantee of four keys are left to either gamble with the system or not bother at all and face that disadvantage the game only has two modes ranked and conquest after launching at time of writing a year and a half ago players get to choose if they want to play a constant ranked ladder or lengthy strategic multi round matches there is no true casual mode a strange choice for a mobile game and as currency and cosmetic rewards are tied to both systems players that do not actively seek to climb are disfavoured by the system the only thing approaching casual is the proving grounds of conquest but that forces the player to play a mode they may not find enjoyable gold the game s free cosmetic currency has been reduced drastically as the game has progressed it used to commonly occur in collector s caches but is now relegated to either ranked 500 gold for rank 90 conquest or daily missions in a week doing all the missions rewards the player 200 gold additionally players can gain some amounts of gold from the season pass as free rewards when a normal card variant costs 700 gold and a standard casual player may get if they do all their dailies 800 gold a month assuming they play most of the week in a game about collection is unsatisfying the album system is whale bait and filling even one out for a f2p player would take months this is also not to mention that some albums feature ultimate variants which require a whopping 5000 tokens for one variant to me this is just a way to reward players for sinking their time and wallets in the game additionally cards from series 4 and 5 may feature in an album so not only do the players have to plan out wanting a specific card but they also have to wait for the variant to show up in their shop to get a 1 to their album collection when albums tend to range from 9 to 12 cards on average it isn t feasible even at the lowest current range of 8 tokens take time to accumulate for each 12 collection levels players may receive 100 tokens in their caches when a series 4 card requires 3000 tokens that is pricey but still achievable players wishing to buy a single series 5 card at 6000 will face a lengthy time to wait before they get that for free of course the shop is littered with bundles that incentivise players to spend their gold on token bundles but even these have had depreciating value from even a year ago the previous systems in place a few months after the game officially launched were considerably better but have since been changed see the proverbial fishing line being whisked away from the pond after snagging a bite bundles that are purchasable with gold have become increasingly rare and it is not uncommon for the shop page to be littered with upwards of 3 real currency bundles at a time even when gold bundles are introduced their prices are hiked up before release from their datamined versions so it s a complete crapshoot as to whether a potential future valuable bundle is even worth saving for or if a player can even afford it at the time the newly released leagues feature is blatantly pay to win players compete in miniature ranked board leagues where the top player out of 30 is rewarded a spotlight key along with multiple other rewards to push their progression the pay to win element comes from the perks system that allows players to add effects such as doubling the points they win from matches for a short window of time to not losing points when they lose cubes a f2p player will simply have no chance of competing with spenders and it may even be a gold trap for people unaware unavoidable power creep of older cards is an issue while no card is outright superior to another the power ceiling of newer cards reaches higher and higher heights this isn t as much a problem as it is something to be aware of meta defining even meta warping cards that stifle design space take too long to be changed zabu was infamously ran in most decks for over a year before finally being changed forcing the developers to design all four cost cards around a single card for a year through either changing existing 4 costs or limiting new effects with this consideration another fun coincidence was that zabu was a season pass card and was even more broken on release series drops where cards become more accessible are extremely rare the developer s communication makes the community hold on with bated breath that one may come in the future but the exact details are never told previously series drops occurred at a much more regular pace and made the card acquisition system fairer even now cards that were released over a year ago have never been dropped the pc client ui has grown worse and worse since its release after less than a year the display has constant bugs such as abruptly skipping past the end match screen not letting the user continue to the main menu unless they view a card s upgrade to constant errors that can kick players out of games abruptly the game has been plagued with notification bugs for as long as i can recall making it impossible for players to realistically remove every small red dot on every single tab there have been several instances of card effects crashing matches which to my knowledge were eventually fixed kang overall marvel snap is a relic of what it once was the relatively simple more generous version of the past has been removed to cater to big spenders it s a lot better than other even worse mobile games but that isn t the biggest achievement this game makes millions but it doesn t deserve to while not technically pay to win for the most part paying does alleviate the many flaws that come with progression and once you ve spent a little why not more and so on and so on until marvel snap is the only game you feel obligated to play i would not recommend anyone get further than having a complete series 3 collection as that is where the admittedly long honeymoon period ends and the harsh reality of the game truly appears new cards are infrequent rewards aren t rewarding enough and it can begin to feel like a chore if you are looking for a game with decent enough gameplay marvel characters and an infinitely long carrot on a stick for personalisation check it out just don t keep your hopes up
