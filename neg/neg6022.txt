2019 europa universalis iv is a game with much potential it s a medevil strategy game which i enjoyed a lot until i wanted to do little things which i couldn t do unless i had a dlc which of course i had to pay for the base game is alright and about 15 would be fair for this game however it can get boring very quickly when you realise that majority of the dlc that paradox offers should already be in the base game but charge you an f tonne for them anyway that is unacceptable
