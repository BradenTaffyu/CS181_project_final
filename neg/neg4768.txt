2022 the game is fine but it has been severely lacking in support lately one of the only large updates in a while was in response to a competitor coming out while several longstanding and inconvenient albeit minor bugs still remain what takes it over the edge to me is a failure to commit to being against discrimination in their moderation policy and community in general both in the general chat which is an irc channel linked to the game and in the discord server there has been a dangerous and biased stance on moderation that berserk games actively refuses to take a line on dismissing sexual minorities as politics and banning discussion while the sexual majority is not politics offering up pr statements and urging that they will do better with no material impact and toeing the line in a way that cedes grounds to the worst elements of their community in the event that bg makes a whirlwind turnaround i will have to come back to this review but i do not have my hopes up
