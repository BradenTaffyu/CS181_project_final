overall a decent game at the current state but not necessarily a good value when the game launched a lot of hp fans were very excited that excitement quickly faded when people got into the game and discovered that it was kind of half finished the presence of exclusives to specific platforms was annoying and there were some really bad bugs over time they did fix these problems and release all the exclusives to everyone but it took a pretty long time by then a lot of the players were pretty much done then there s the whole debacle with quidditch they teased adding it from the beginning promoted a playtest directly to the players and then wb ended up contracting another studio to make it an entirely separate game it came off as at best really poor communication and at worst a blatantly unethical deception as far as how the game actually is the story is pretty good and engaging the gameplay and combat is fun and the soundtrack and voice acting is decent the characters are a little one dimensional and its a bit frustrating how small hogwarts castle is in relation to the total map and how often the quests and tasks take you to some random place in the countryside far away from it but overall its a fun game with the base game costing 60 and the dlc another 20 when bought separately and also not really adding that much content in terms of size or replayability this game is pretty expensive i probably got about 100 hours of actual gameplay with the rest frankly just being to round out a dumb steam achievement that requires you to start 3 more playthroughs and complete like 5 hours each of the beginning for 80 there are a lot better values your average indie game probably costs a 4th of that and provides close to the same number of hours of play overall probably not worth it short of a sale and it should be a significant one given that its still not that long of a game
