2016 i speak as a veteran of the series is anyone else underwhelmed i don t think it was worth the 40 price i was expecting more instead we get hoi3 with better production and diplomacy systems land combat is the meat of the hoi franchise and yet the ai still doesn t know a strategy other than ww1 style broad front and won t bother with encirclements and if you want to manually control your troops in order to make guderian proud it s way too difficult due to the ui 10 division stacks are not divided on the map and each division you specifically want must be picked out from the army list to the left which cannot be trimmed to help you the ai britain especially also keeps doing naval invasions with pathetic 3 division forces even though its impossible for them to win foreign expeditionary forces that join my japanese army take land not for my country but for their own it s incredibly annoying so when india capitulates there s a bunch of grey german province blobs surrounded by a bigger mint green one of the reorganized nationalist china hold up nationalist china why not japan you may ask that s because of a stupid game mechanic where if you take an enemy province from an allied nation s province the capture will go to them instead of you i invaded burma and beyond via my chinese puppet s borders puppets are entirely not worth it because they will refuse to give you occupied territory apparently they are concerned that it would be unfair for them for you to take their spoils and because they will not give you resources they also barely have any factories and so will not contribute to the war effort it is impossible to mimic real life production for planes at least the real life japanese could on average roll off 6 zeroes from the assembly line per day while i can only manage 2 36 with the strength of 15 factories and can t i put in any more either lest i sacrifice the ija s supplies there are also other kinds of planes which they produced in great numbers simultaneously but i am unable to do so because aircraft production appears to be underpowered the tech tree is stupid to anyone with any knowledge of ww2 military history for example the level 1 battleship for japan is the nagato but the level 2 battleship is the kongo stupid everyone knows that the nagato had guns of significantly larger caliber and armor that was very much thicker than the kongo which was technically called a battleship after ww1 but for all practical purposes was a battlecruiser also the level 2 carrier capable naval bomber is the a6m2 n wtf everybody knows at this point that the plane was a zero with floats on not a dedicated naval bomber germany is also really weak but that s just the fault of the military ai i also conquered russia in 2 years as the japanese the fact that i even managed to do this brings the game s realism into serious question it was too easy most of the war was spent not fighting but gaining land maybe the ai just makes horrible divisions i will have to look into this later the warscore system is still awfully backwards i accounted for most russian casualties and took the entirety of siberia i called in germany later in the war to speed things up but because most of the vp s are in european russia my war contribution almost immediately jumped to nil also the peace conferences the ai make stupid decisions after the comintern surrendered turkey puppeted sinkiang and hungary used a single tiny state to make a puppeted russia this tiny russia is surrounded by the massive grey blob of the german reich by the way so yes there s my venting 7 years of waiting and this is what we get the only things i can say for sure that have been improved are naval and air combat they are both very very good now compared to hoi3 s tedious micromanagement and 100 ship doomstacks but the rest of the game is so incredibly lacking i should have known that it was going to be underwhelming when two devs admitted that they could not understand nato counters i don t know what happened to the hoi3 team but the hoi4 team appears to be mostly greenhorns in the wargaming field or else they would have done a lot better
