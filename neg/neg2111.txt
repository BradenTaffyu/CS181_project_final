2023 what could be a great game is destroyed by the greed of the developer the grinding meta game here is no fun and it ruins everything you can play this game for years and never complete the full tech tree of even a single nation repair time and repair costs for destroyed vehicles often make it impossible to continue playing at all and that is true even for premium accounts recent economy changes made this annoying grind fest even more frustrating single premium vehicles cost more than a full price aaa game events are a joke who wants to play a game full time like doing a 40h job for a week or two to win some rare event vehicle worth 50 or 70 euros
