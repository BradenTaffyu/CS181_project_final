2015 it is a shame that fallout 4 turned from rpg with fps elements 3 and new vegas into fps with light rpg elements tl dr version good game bad rpg bethesda s writing is inferior to obsidian s as this is a pc game it means i ll have to nitpick about the port at this point it s clear that bethesda doesn t care about pc side the game is designed to run at 60 fps and is locked to it via v sync and we know what that does to mouse controls things like fov v sync and depth of field are buried in multiple ini files and you have to set them to read only or the game reverts them back to default values as v sync is enabled by default the game has terrible mouse acceleration problems and disabling v sync also introduced screen tearing forcing me to use third party software to lock my fps screen tearing was solved by locking the frame rate bit higher than 60 the performance isn t anything spectacular either with frame drops when entering anywhere with more than few buildings i was forced to drop it down to medium settings to avoid biggest drops which is something i shouldn t have to do with my hardware i5 3570k 16gb ram gtx 980 and installed on wd black 7200rpm hdd the loading times were dreadfully long at times at the worst i could ve gone and made a cup of tea and it would still be loading fortunately i ve experienced only few crashes there s been few bugs such as entering power armor or terminal and character gets stuck forcing you to reload your previous save i encountered one game breaking bug that made me restart the game but luckily it happened only few hours into the game the bug gave me constant radiation damage no matter where i was there s not much story to speak of your characters are locked with specific background stories and they re fully voice acted which i feel detracts from the rpg element at the start of the game you re hurried up into a vault see the bomb go boom and then you re turned into a meat popsicle later you wake up your significant other is killed your baby kidnapped and then it s for a rescue not much really happens between leaving the vault and finding your son you re mostly doing fetch quests for others until you get to him biggest things that happen are when you finally decide to join up with a faction i said that this is more like fps than rpg so what do i mean with it no karma skills have been removed only perks remain and traits do not exist anymore i get what they were going for with removing the skills they wanted to avoid the waste of levels between skill checks 76 99 in lockpicking were totally wasted but then they gated them behind level checks so it doesn t really change it no level cap throws any consideration for builds out of the window as every character will end up being the same at some point you can even use your level up points for your special stats which makes builds even more redundant because you don t have to make any sacrifices conversations consist of yes no question and sarcastic responses and what you are going to say are shown to you really vaguely instead of full responses speech checks are dice rolls meaning you can just save scum until you pass it intelligence 1 characters are treated the same as int 10 so no more silly dialogue companions are more like walking witty comment machines than people following you you can t initiate conversations with them and they don t have their own agendas as an example boone from new vegas will warn you that he will engage any legion members on sight no matter what and oh boy will he do it i just helped him by giving him antimateria rifle in f4llout the brotherhood of steel wants to exterminate everything that isn t human but don t do about it when you bring a synth super mutant or a ghoul into their place nor will your companions care where you bring them the worst you ll get is a mean comment from someone you re better off without any of them they can t shoot straight and get in your way all the time the well hyped customization also falls flat on its face the base weapon variety is lacking so you don t have much of a choice in what you re going to use and no modding 10mm pistol to fire full auto doesn t make it an smg or putting different colored grip doesn t turn it into different weapon the hardest thing about modifying your gear is finding the materials to do it not deciding what you want to put on as damage is the only way to go the settlement building was a good idea but as usual bethesda leaves it half way done and expects modders to make it better why can t i decide where i can build my settlement i m restricted to wherever they ve put the workbenches and work with it you can t change the terrain or sink objects into it so your protective walls will be floating in the air and being ugly halo 3 back in 2007 got this right the variety of items you can place is limited and by limited i mean you can t build half the items you see in the world then you have the settlers who occupy your settlements you can assign them to do different tasks but you don t see who is doing what and some don t do whatever free jobs are around without you telling them and even doing so they can ignore it then they have the nerve to tell you thanks to our work this is starting to look like home and you re welcome here too i build this for you and now you act like you own the place next part gets into spoiler territory about factions so feel free to skip it there are four factions you can join which are the minutemen brotherhood of steel railroad and the institute i don t really know what the minutemen want to do other than trying to help people against the dangers of wasteland after finding out that a big group of them turned into bandits after the group started fighting each other i didn t want to help these people into position of power railroad wants to free synths from institute s control but they lack any kind of longterm goal to consider helping them they re too busy liberating vending machines to think about it if you decide to help them they blow up half of commonwealth i m not joking they re going to overload the institute s nuclear reactor brotherhood of steel are still being jerks towards anybody and taking what they want at gunpoint they re really no better than bandits they are just better armed and more fanatic their goal is to clear commonwealth of all scum meaning super mutants synths ghouls and other nasties they also blow up the institute s reactor the institute is the boogeyman of the commonwealth in short they re mad scientists with no real goal in mind they produce synths synthetic humans kidnap people and replace them with synth copies why i don t know they also like to tell you that synths are mere tools but why do they insist on making them indistinguishable from humans they tell you that replacing all humans with synths is the best hope for mankind they are also responsible for super mutants being present in the commonwealth they experimented with the fev virus and instead of disposing their failed experiments they let them go to the surface initially i was ready to join up with bos even though they re but they had clear motivations about what they want i changed my mind about betraying them after hearing that i ll be the next leader of the institute and thought that i could change all the insane things they re doing unfortunately as a leader all you get is one meaningless choice and repeating quests spoilers about factions end herefinally the ending it s weak all you get is two different slides with commentary that barely differentiate from each other they re literally called male a b female a b you don t get anything about what happens with your companions your settlements the people you met or the cities you visited nothing
