2022 early access review such a massive let down this game could revolutionize both rpg and rts genres at the same time but instead it is a hollow husk of broken promises taleworlds has added nothing of value to the game the entirety of early access and now are moving on to full release with this broken pile so they can collect a little more money before it fades completely if you haven t played yet you can expect about 10 hours of fun before you start to see all the aspects that are missing or should ve been fleshed out further or in most cases wasn t fleshed out at all this is purely a battle simulator and does a poor job of it any true value will come from the modding community
