this full version release is fishy the new update and the price change to 45 for this game feels off it feels weird the full version between the last update and this is a graphical update that changed very little and not even core problems not fixing many issues and clunkiness that the game is plagued by all these years and you decide to release it in it s current state and change the price did you release the game so you could change the price out of desperation with minimal changes i ve played since 2014 and this is the full release really are you sure about this i know the unstable release version was here a while but this doesn t seem right in it s state
