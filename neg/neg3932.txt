2022 i love this game but the price changes for turkey and argentina are simply unacceptable the insane increase from 43 liras to 180 liras will simply ensure no turkish gamer even attempts to buy your game from a legitimate storefront punishing the legitimate customers of my country and argentina for the wrongdoings of people from places with much better economic statuses is very much an immoral move and it is for this reason that i and i am sure many other turkish and argentinian players who are were interested in this game will no longer be supporting this company in its future endeavours not that it seems to matter to them anyway considering they just said haha we don t care about the revenue we get with your devalued currency get lol i hope this issue will find some footing in the public consciousness because if this trend gets followed by other game studios especially indie ones the customers of this two countries will simply become unable to buy reasonably affordable games way to go mt ee
