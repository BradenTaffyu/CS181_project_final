2017 upfront i ll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times however a litany of problems make me give this a negative review dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously insultingly difficult seriously you should never have to go into a battle knowing exactly what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving not winning just surviving and the only reason you know what s about to happen is because you ve tried it half a dozen times and failed each time weak story compared to d os and heavy use of sad tired and predictable tropes half the time it wasn t even clear what we were trying to accomplish and who what we were fighting against or for and when major plot points did occur most of the time our response was really we re doing this again sigh for a game that encourages you to forge your own way it punishes you for not following some pre assumed path through the world heaven help you if you choose a different direction enemies do not scale with level and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive so if you head west when the game expects you to head east you ll struggle battles that break the game s own pre established rules examples repeat casting of abilities which have multi round cooldowns and stacking identical status ailments case in point the sallow man s airborne plague which bypasses all armour physical and magical stacks with itself i was at 15 con at one point because of three repeat casts and can be cast every round inconsistent lore world impacts you can kill someone and consume their soul only for them to show up again later apparently none the worse for wear yay that achieved a lot multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver to add to that if the speaker doesn t have the required item for a fetch quest too bad having it in the party isn t enough but the game doesn t let you know that does it that would be too much to ask quest system is broken somewhat repaired with a patch but if you d progressed past a certain point the damage was done the tarquin side quest was just a balls up my partner who was using a controller i use keyboard mouse had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment certain skills just wouldn t work no reason was given you just can t select this character because we say so the controller interface also made line of sight hard to gauge so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle multi stage boss battles stop just stop with this tired over used and just irritating chiche this has been done so many times it s just not interesting exciting or surprising some puzzles have an exact solution required but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints another case in point the cursed revenants in the lizard embassy we gave up trying to solve that and just left them there we got around them enough to finish the quest but they ll be sitting there in the ruins till judement day more on the battle difficulty if you re at the correct character level for a given encounter ie a l5 party against l5 opponents i don t think it s unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo i gm a pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others depending on their importance in the plot progression however given that in 95 of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first the number of times one or more of our party members were one shot killed or disabled before they ve had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous this ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle which i consider meta gaming in a crpg sure give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party but don t compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party for a game that we ve spent over 100 hours on this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that i can t say i ve enjoyed it we ve given up trying to win the final battle and to be honest i couldn t care less about how it ends there were occasional moments of fun but the negatives outweigh them
