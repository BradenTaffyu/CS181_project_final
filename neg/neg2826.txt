2018 hello before 2 0 this game was amazing like i can t express how good it felt to play this with friends i want to talk about a few things that i have really found boring since 2 0 bad new updates the game is so much slower fleet caps were low before but now its insane how low they are not being able to go into systems that havent been researched first the ai feels more stupid than ever the fact the game worked and the developers changed everything good new updates i like the new way that combat is calculated i like how you can steal planets in war the new war screen please developers take a look at the evolution of combat in runescape which has caused the game to constantly lose players ever since this is what not to do when you have a good product make it better dont change what isnt broken
