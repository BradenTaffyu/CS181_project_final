2020 early access review i am giving this game a thumbs down with a heavy heart when i was nothing but a little kid i had been waiting for this game now i am quite a bit older and it finally arrived i believed this game would singlehandedly change the course of video game history like legends such as skyrim did it s still ea but i think it will so why the thumbs down as long as the chinese communist party gives 10 year bans to players for criticizing its tyrannical murderous regime and taleworlds does nothing to stop it i can not recommend the game to anyone please devs boot the tyrants out of multiplayer moderation and i will happily recommend your game
