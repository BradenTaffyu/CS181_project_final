2023 this game feels like fanfic based on a harry potter movie by a talented but inexperienced child don t get me wrong the game is alright it just sets its own stakes pretty high and then can t keep up tl dr there are almost no interesting puzzles most content is just repeatable placeholder no impact from your choices on a game plot the battle system is very promising yet frustratingly simplistic and the story is so predictable and overdramatic that it starts to be annoying the graphics are great though and many minor animations are delightful the graphics are excellent the world is beautiful and there are many many minor effects that you ll totally love such as small animations of beasts spells effects castle ruins small villages and so on but it fails to work as a whole for most of your gameplay you ll be flying on a broom or jumping by floo powder chimneys solving hundreds of puzzles that are indistinguishable from each other there are like 5 or 6 patterns for them and they are straightforward so you ll get bored of them after the first ten and all others will just be groundhog day all over again the plot is boring most characters are shallow and all they do is tell you about their past or what you should do next there are some interesting moments in the arc of sebastian where characters are shown not as plywood for the plot but that happens for a very brief moment in a long story i do understand that wb tried to keep the game 13 so it should not be complicated but it felt like they wrote its plot for a five year old your decisions will not affect the plot or the world except for some cosmetic stuff or situational voice lines of surrounding characters and it would be fine if the game didn t try to present it to you like you re making some severe choice each time hell you can learn and use all three unforgivable curses and it won t change anything about your path in this game and the most controversial part for me was the battle system it has everything to be great but with no auto levelling repeating enemies and their primitive battling algorithms you are just clicking them to death juggling three types of spells to break their colourful shields often enemies will stand before you and wait for you to bash them out of existence i wanted a hard battle but the game does nothing to challenge you in fights even in hard mode
