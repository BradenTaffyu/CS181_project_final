2018 early access review 7 years about 1 meaningful update every year and a half it is a fun game but boy do they sure take their time also the end is nowhere near this is probably going to be one of those eternal early access games also they built this in java so that doesn t help much their personal built engine kinda sucks and there is often memory leaks they probably should have just used a real engine instead of trying to pull a minecraft don t get me wrong it is a really fun game you just should have a lot of patience with these dudes
