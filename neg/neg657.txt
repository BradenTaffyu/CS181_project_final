an excellent xcom style game with no respect for your time there are no manual saves in a single player game where failing means losing 1 hour of progress you are replaying missions to grind bosses for their masteries after 75 hours i still haven t even recruited all the playable characters and the crafting system is left untouched as it also requires grinding for materials
