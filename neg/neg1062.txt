2018 in no real way is this review structured it s my thoughts and speculations great as a game but the death of fallout this is not a fallout game it is post nuclear fps with a fallout skin new comers to the game will see it as a fun fps with light rpgish mechanics while longtime fans of the series will see it as a shallow fps that lacks a meaningful story retcons established lore out of no where and removes the rpg side of the game the gunplay and world is smooth and pretty respectively but the deep grim dark setting the absurd outlandishness the agency the player has gone the characters with embellished back stories and empathetic motivations gone but say hello to generic mercenary guy i hate the government press lady please help me farmer 48934 and more cliches ngl though i liked valentine i was trying to be fair to this game in my previous reviews but i ve kept coming back to this game thinking it can t have been that bad could it every time i have come away with an increasingly negative experience i have put in the hours weighed my opinions against the pros and cons discussed it with fans and haters alike my end opinion it s a good game and i hate it for that there is no real rp or rpg mechanics it s like a kids game in that respect choose which flashy animation you want your character to have and which emotion way do you want to accept this radiant quest with honestly this game is fun and if you want a light hearted shooter it s good my anger and hate stems from people s blind defense of it because they haven t played earlier variations or simply think that because it works and is playable it is perfect and now accept this bland shallow experience as fallout while bethesda bury the existing themes and lore under a desire for broad appeal it s gone from being art experience to a mere product the only debates i have over this game are over whether it is good or not nv and 3 actually provoke discussion over characters and quest outcomes the quest outcomes and characters here are meaningless i ve seen past the graphics and gun play and when i looked past it i saw todd s face laughing the wind howled an owl hooted and a gunshot rang out as fallout was shot in the head in shallow grave near goodsprings
