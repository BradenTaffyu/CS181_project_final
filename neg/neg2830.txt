2018 stellaris was a great game in the 4x space tradition until the most recent patch the 2 0 patch took one of the most interesting features multiple kinds of ftl technology which is what made this game so unique and forced all races to use the same ftl tech just my luck they picked the one i disliked the most i am rather annoyed but i got a lot of play time in before this patch so i guess i got my money s worth paradox made no secret of this change i was apprehensive but determined to give it a fair shake before passing judgement i have played several games post 2 0 but it s just not the same my only regret is not trying it before i bought the most recent dlc that went along with the free update i am a paradox fan i buy a lot of their games and dlc i was prepared to do the same for stellaris but this recent change has made the game so much less fun i won t be playing it anymore nor purchasing dlc for new players this may be a fun game for you i urge you to try it for less than 2 hours but for me it s just now another 4x clone and that s a real shame
