a testament to modern games first release the game in an incredibly broken state from terrible performance the utter lack of content inside the base game which we all know they plan for countless dlcs to milk as much as they can from it and the bugs inside the game which cause so many problems once you start to build a city of more than 10 000ish people second play it off as no big deal the poor communication from release until just recently in early march word s of the week that gave absolutely no real information about the game or how things under the surface were done third modding not having official modding support at release was the worst thing that they could have done and they did just that so many things that amazing modders in the cities community could have done to help fix this game in the weeks following launch but they couldn t to just now add modding support 5 months after release is a disgrace we all know that modders will be the ones that fix this pile of garbage that co and paradox call a game the newest dlc being 10 for a handful of house assets and 4 trees is just another sign that they don t care about the state of the game and lack of content just that they want your money save yourself the money and buy something from a different publisher one that actually cares about making good games and that work on release
