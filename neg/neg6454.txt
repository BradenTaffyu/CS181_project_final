2022 recycled game made for kids not people who like cars each update makes the game worse be it more bugs or dumb policy enforcement for me its feels like a majority of the content they are adding is just rehashed content from previous games i m still encountering bugs and performance issues that the game launched with i regret paying 100 dollars for this when i should ve got in on gamepass or waited for a sale
