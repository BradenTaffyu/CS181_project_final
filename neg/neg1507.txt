2022 feels like the devs are barely doing anything with this game barren of new features only the graphics and the performance in battle seem like things which improved over the warband still filled with baffling design decisions like enemy armies returning to full strength just days after being utterly crushed economy having no balance diplomacy is a joke does not really feel like a simulation at all especially after recently playing a game like x4 where every resource and ship has to come from somewhere is going somewhere and has some impact on the game if something happens to it this game on the other hand regularly feels like it cheats or cuts corners to present the fa ade of simulating anything usually in a way that feels poorly thought out or low effort i used to hold out hope that a lot of these things would be addressed over time but they just haven t been and now the devs wanna say the game is in 1 0 i totally believe the rumours that the devs were just milking this to stay employed for the longest amount of time ever and not actually caring about making a good game
