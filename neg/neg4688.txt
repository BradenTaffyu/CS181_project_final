2021 i ve played this game for a few hours now and i have mixed feelings about this for the record i ve spent many hours in the previous two games therefore my review will be based off that experience for the third generation of a game this is underwhelmingly different to the previous two for a game about cars the driving physics and the car sounds are trash they really should ve remade this there s also no added complexity to the car parts a lot of them just float around and you just pull them off a new feature of liquid tanks has been added which adds a underwhelming experience of draining and filling different liquid tanks that feature is incomplete though as renewing brake fluid requires to drain them by the brake caliper in real life but in the game you just drain the tank and that s it there s still no brake lines in the game which is like one of the most replaced parts in the real life why am i still able to repair one brake and leave the other untouched you always replace brakes in pairs in real life to avoid uneven brake force not including this requirement in a simulator is a hefty overlook like i said it s the third generation of the game why do we still have made up car makes most of the cars are based on real life counterparts so why not just get a license for it this should ve been in the game by this point instead you get a bunch of fantasy makes and buy some real ones with dlc which makes up a weird mixture this game is not cheap just get your licenses already i m having issues with the game aswell for instance the diagnose view has been dumbed down so you can only examine parts from outside the car and you re only able to examine some of them apart from this feature being clunky and unintuitive what s the logical explanation for that approach if i m a car mechanic and i get a closer look at a part i can easily tell the condition of the part so why do i have to do it from far back and only on selected parts why do i have to drain the engine oil and take off the oil sump just to find out that it s at 79 this is total nonsense mate just plain playtime stretching thumbs down for that i am playing on expert mode which removes a few features one of them being the info window together with the condition display while this makes sense at first and most of the times works well this causes a lot of problems for instance you get a car you re meant to examine and replace brakes below 45 after a test drive it shows one brake disc being at 38 you re now supposed to differentiate between the 45 orange and the slightly darker 38 orange that s not reliably possible so now i had to take off the wheel the brake caliper and brake pad to get the brake disc into my inventory and find out that it wasn t the right one now put everything back on again and try the other three wheels this is not fun and you feel stupid doing it this is an incomplete mechanic as in real life you would feel in the test drive which one of the brakes is weaker but in the game it doesn t tell you it only gives you a part list well in conclusion this game has been a disappointment so far with more downgrades than upgrades from its predecessors i surely hope the devs are going to tweak some things in the future instead of releasing overpriced dlc s
