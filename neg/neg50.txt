2020 early access review i wish steam had a middle ground between recommend or don t recommend the game has an atmosphere about it great setting and some really interesting mechanics but it feels like feature creep has buried this game most of the highly anticipated features are either cancelled or pushed back indefinitely in favor of other newer features i love and hate this game at the same time because i know its potential but i also know that it s likely never going to get there you can tell this game is a labor of love for the few people working on it but i feel like they overshot their target the game should have been done several years ago but they just keep adding new and incomplete systems to the game without finishing the stuff that is dragging the game down i can only hope that the developers read this and take the criticism to heart and not just pass it off as an angry person who didn t feel like they got their money s worth i hope their next project is better organized has better funding and a development schedule that is actually adhered to this game could have been something truly legendary but instead got caught in the pit of mediocrity trying to add too many things
