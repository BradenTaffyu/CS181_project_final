2021 i cannot believe this game still suffers from constant multiplayer desyncs i mean seriously how much data is it sending to and from servers players that a turn based game desysncs constantly only way to temporarily stop the desync is to stop your game and restart the session oh and the season pass is a waste of money for people who purchased this game and dlc upon release just another way to try and get the most money out of people
