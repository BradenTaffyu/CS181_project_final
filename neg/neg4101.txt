2018 look the current iteration of the game is amazing the modding community has done an incredible job of creating content gameplay graphically and universewise the game itself is incredible and the mods make it amazing you may be noticing a sudden downswing in the stated popularity of this program it is not because of the now current version the reservation is the current eula which amounts to good evening gentlemen all your space are belong to us you must allow this to play the game you already paid for feel free to replace space with data identity mods etc nor at this time may i recieve a refund for a game for which i cannot accept their terms of service given that the new eula allows both seizure of mods without monetary renumeration and their resale without royalty and the distribution and sale of individual s private data including but not limited to identifying data photographs and other such i cannot in good conscience recommend the game at this time or at any time that such a license exists i have long refused to have anything to do with companies that have the idea that you bought our product you become our product or worse yet you bought someone else s product under better eula now you are ours even if you never agreed to that initially and would never agree to it there can be no meeting of the minds in this instance i pray the great kraken visits their headquarters and shows them no mercy for they deserve none should they change this policy i will be altering the review until that time i have no choice but to refuse their eula and leave this review which neither adequately expresses my disgust nor the depths of my disappointment
