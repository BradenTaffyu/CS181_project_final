early access review i remember enjoying this game in a19 but upon coming back to it in a21 i returned to a buggy mess the devs are more interested in bloated graphic design than improving the game engine code so that it can handle said bloat without crashing single player works sure but as soon as the game has to handle more players it starts falling apart anytime you ask it to spawn a player that isn t the host if i cared about graphics believe me i wouldn t be playing this game the neglect to the game s engine and mechanics marks the devs incredibly tone deaf take on the game s direction and the combative attitude the devs often take means the game probably won t get better as they wallow in self pity and denial
