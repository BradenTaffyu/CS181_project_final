2023 lets be perfectly clear i m a warband bannerlord player through and through with over 1000 hours combined tracked and untracked i had warband before i had steam this game is extremely unfinished and outside of cosmetic and some behavioral changes just an updated warband it improves on some of warband as follows questing storyline 5 10by far better over warband no more herding and you have a bit of storyline going for you however the storyline needs a little more help you get ingrained in the story and 20 minutes later there is a pause in the story fine you have to find the banner yay you found it more quests storyline yes but not really and the conspiracy quests are a total nightmare not because they are hard but because its extremely repetitive and i don t think you can actually reduce the conspiracies i was diligent for like 15 quests until i got fed up but you can sure gain more none the less in my play through my home base was makeb and some of the quests wanted you on the complete other side of the map to finish graphically for sure better than warband 8 10siege battle 6 10 definitely better but at the same time a bit difficult to manage some how having more options begets more restrictions you want to put together a winning position but they don t always listen and if you have to many of the same unit they sometimes refuse the position until you add more groupings and more groupings makes it easier to panic charge everyone you just put so nicely together in siege the ai isn t always very intelligent either there is a perfectly good open gate but they still charge the ladders workshops 2 10 completely unfinished someone actually finished the workshops as a mod from the unfinished files that is not cool somethings i wish we could have the ability to improve our villages wagons moneysink increased carrying weight speed ability to send out recruiters troops to collect new recruits defend terrain we have a garrison why can t we use them increased storyline keep us immersed more mount types and armor heavy draft better camels heavy duty decorative armor would love to have the ability to breed my own calvary horse camels similar to being able to build our own weapons i would not suggest this to anyone who wanted to play mount and blade i d send them to warband first as once you get bored of vanilla warband the workshop filled with mods that can give you 100 s of hours of play through bannerlord has not reached that as of yet and is unfinished and needs more tlc before i could say bannerlord is good enough for the other saps like me that don t care and pour out our hearts to a slightly upgraded nostalgia its almost harvesting season
