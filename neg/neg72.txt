2016 early access review maybe i will bite my tongue or should i say my fingers and take my words back at some point but for now i must say that this game is no more than a joke updates just doesn t make any sense no vehicles no npcs no navigation absolutely nothing that is really important and things has been this way for few years now those updates they re releasing reminds me horse armor dlc for oblivion it is r i d i c u l o u s just read the news feed for this game and pay attention to the feature itself not the way they tell about it and you will kinda understand it on your own re texrure re animation re sound and a new super feature calories sounds fun eh they forbid to talk about that in their community forum you see they gone silence mode for our own sake or some b llsh t like that and don t give any feed about progress on serious stuff they promised long time ago my guess it s 0 and it s not going to be above anyway pretty sure they kinda mad they can t as well delete reviews here in steam store well bad for you indiestone i will complain all i want here because i can because this is not your personal forum with only your loyal zombie funboys army after all i paid my money for it and i hope that at least one person will read my review and will not make this same mistake
