2023 im just gonna keep this short the horrid progression system for the very lackluster content vs price is an immense stretch they will add more content sure but paid content for a game that doesn t give its worth in content with the price already and you only will spend time with part of the content drought because the horrid progression system hinders you in experiencing the rest of the limited amount of content you would only get this if you are a massive fan of payday the game is there the polish is there there is a mighty skeleton to the game but with next to no meat and nothing to support it
