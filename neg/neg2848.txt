the game has so dramatically changed in the last 1 5 years that it is incomprehensible to people who have been playing for years typical paradox dlc practices locking important updates and systems behind them constant and unnecessary reworks to core systems every three months and a slew of mediocre dlc introducing breaking bugs there is no reason to purchase this game anymore no reason to play it anymore
