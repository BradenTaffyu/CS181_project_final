2017 i love the game but i hate the ever rising cost if you want to play with expansions i would have given it a thumbs up but the dlc cost is getting stupid it s hard not to be lured in by the dlc as without buying it you get a nagging feeling that your game is now incomplete but it s getting beyond insane to try to keep up with the costs of playing i have other paradox games and it s the same thing dlc dlc dlc i m actually starting to miss being frustrated with my nes and constantly blowing into the cartridges to get them to work simply because a game had to be complete before being released as a rom it had to be bug free or it didn t sell once word of mouth got out sure the games were simpler but i do recall actually having fun playing them now it s getting to the point that they are simply becoming increasingly expensive timekillers i wish there was a mixed button instead of just an up or downvote as i would click mixed at this point i want to click a thumbs up kinda but every dlc that comes along just emphasizes more and more to me that the game just wasn t finished at launch
