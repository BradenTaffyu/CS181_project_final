2017 insane grind even with premium membership bombers have literally no place in the game they could be as well controlled by the ai many usless uncompetetive placeholder vechicles planes very few resticted game modes poor matchmaking poor balance generally each nation is strong at some tiers and bad at the others instead of for example having at least one great vechicle in each tier which means you will have to struggle playing multiple bad vechicles planes until you get your hands on tools that can stomp the others than will now have to struggle against you very few maps played over and over again many maps don t have wwii feeling to them developers pretty much ignore the playerbase going their own way great looking plane vechicle models nice graphics pretty detailed sim modes mechanics for both planes tanks
