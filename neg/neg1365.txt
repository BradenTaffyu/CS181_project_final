2021 early access review have owned this game since the very first day of early access been watching patches for a while and have not seen a content patch that actually adds anything significant for a very long time this game went into early access almost two years ago its got decent gameplay but the amount of bugs crashes and overall balancing issues plague the experience and even makes testing an unfinished early access title almost unbearable i will note that i at least appreciate the work that the devs have been doing to attempt to fix some issues but more importantly is where is the content this game is severely lacking content even for an early access game because i know some of you will point that out remember almost two years have passed since early access started the pandemic happened sure but they have had time to get things done on a positive note if you like combat this game does not disappoint the combat can be fun when the game functions properly also large scale battles are a thing i like mount and blade and i really want this game to be good however i would not recommend in this current state or in the future until meaningful improvements are to be made
