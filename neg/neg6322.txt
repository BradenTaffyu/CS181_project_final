2023 for real harry potter fans a must hogwarts and the world look great and also have a lot of details built in the change of seasons is also very pleasant to look at graphically also a feast for the eyes if you have a good pc raytracing but in terms of gameplay the game is just pure average there s nothing special about the game other than batting your wand around my criteria open world it is simply boring there are a lot of nice details in hogwarts but as soon as you re in the forest or somewhere on the map you don t encounter anything except the occasional deer or enemy the tasks are so incredibly long doing the same thing 100 times super exciting combat system great at first glance but after a while you don t really need to do anything except spam buttons your character even targets the enemies himself even on harder difficulty levels it s no challenge to just press b or a and you re done wish they would have thought of something a bit more difficult but i can also understand that the game is made accessible to all types of gamers your opponents level up with you accordingly you never get stronger or notice it because you will never meet really hard and really easy opponents you lose your interest in the boring loot which is thrown at you every 2 minutes and you don t feel like upgrading your stuff because it doesn t bring you anything your opponents level up with you so why upgrade please introduce an option like in any other rpg upscalling the opponents on and off story it s no secret that the story is just poorly written though it could be worse the only interesting storyline is sebastian s that one was also really fun to play and the sequences to it looked wonderful beasts you have a good selection of mounts and in itself catching beasts is fun but then waiting 30 min for a feather after feeding and petting the animal waste of time and in the end you forget it anyway and have to pet and feed it again and wait 30 min again applause and in general your vivarium doesn t bring you anything except upgrading your clothes no interaction with the animals except 2 animations feeding and petting a lot of potential lost my character no decisions have any influence your character has no character as funny as it sounds you can choose your clothes and also your wand and broom as you like that s good but that s about it for your character you don t bond you have no interest in getting to know yourself or your friends except sebastian and maybe professor fig because they simply aren t deep enough i could write more but that would go beyond the scope in itself the game is not complete garbage but it is also not a wonderful game that you can enjoy from front to back such as witcher 3 tlou rdr2 sure it s a matter of taste but if you re not so much into harry potter anyway and you re mainly looking at the gameplay you are not interested to get the platin troph after 20 30 hours you no longer want to solve the annoying trials and do the whole time only the same for the game to be really good almost everything actually needs to be more in depth and interesting however i doubt that this will happen too bad
