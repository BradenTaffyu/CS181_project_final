to be honest i hate doing these kind of reviews because when i see several hundred hours of playtime but doesn t recommend yeah okay buddy but to be honest when looking back at my time with balatro i think i would say it s not very fun addicting yes but not fun i think the game suffers from several problems mainly noticeable once you get off the ground of white stake and start working at the harder difficulties a lot of the synergies or combos you think will be very cool end up working in ways that are very anti player and it feels more often than not the game is actively rooting for you to fail i could probably list off a ton of examples as to little things that have annoyed me over the course of this game but i ll just throw out a few there are way too many instances of ankh duplicating a joker that just does not apply twice sixth sense a joker which gives a spectral card and destroys a 6 if you play it as your first hand another joker like this is vampire with a scaling multiplicative effect by draining enhancements from cards if you have two vampires only one will gain the buff now it s easy to say well that makes sense and you re right it does but the problem i have is how often i find myself in many many situations with this game saying look i get it but that s not fun it would ve been cool if it had worked the other way i haven t even commented on the fact that there just simply aren t enough jokers that actually scale with your build so what used to be a fun game at white stake becomes a reset grind in the higher difficulties to get a run actually started most of the time because there are just a lot of jokers that are simply not good enough for all the imposed restrictions at a higher stage which is hilarious because the dev has added an achievement for completing a gold stake run with every joker in the game not every run in balatro is winnable sometimes you are just destined to lose and it feels like the game wants that for you i don t feel that balatro values my time but i ve admittedly come too far to not complete it now save yourself the frustration and try something else
