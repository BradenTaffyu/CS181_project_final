2016 i ve held off until 80 hrs to have my say so i wouldn t regret anything i ve said this is mostly trying different factions trying out battles etc but during this time i have been dissapointed unfortunatly on the whole personally i think this game lacks way too much content i mean seriously only 4 factions are playable unless you buy the chaos dlc which is a massive scam considering they play the biggest role in the game effectivly the main antagonist and from what i ve seen the only unplayable faction that actually unique ish units is brettonia which i can guarantee ca will release as the free lc faction as they ve already done half the job with them diplomacy hasn t really changed and tbh i don t use it that much except the make a bit of money on the side don t even bother with vampire counts as the only factions that will really want to trade etc are the other undead race s which funnily enough ca makes you kill all but 1 at the start of the campaign serioulsy why mousillion is halfway across the map from you and more often that not gets wiped out from being surrounded by hateful brettonia empire kingdoms battle s are fun battle s really are fun this i am happy with and a great step forward in term s of units and a massive kudos to ca for sticking to warhammer s rich lore and factions units i know a lot of people want skeletol archers but dont you dare do it ca the battle s may be over fairly quickly but you really do have to think about what your doing aside from a few ai idiocies its perfect and when you find a giant stomping on your swordsmen gets intense another thing i love is the settlement building but again a massive lack in content here not really a whole lot you can do by turn 100 most of your settlement s will be exactly the same actually having a decent garrison should you so choose means you can be a lot more relaxed with sending your troops out to battle without having to worry about your maxed out town being run over because its has three men and their wives defending it i love that they ve put a huge amount of effort into the way units behave look and how unique they are from other factions it s just a massive shame that everywhere you look it s the same 4 factions with the same armies with the same lords and the same heroes fighting the same battles this this is what makes the game wear out for me i mean at least in atilla and rome ii the unplayable factions were somewhat unique but this is literally orc s over there may as well be one faction dwarves that way again may as well be one faction and look heres the empire and vc guess what there is such a lack of diversity i understand this is a complete new direction for ca and it s not going to be easy practically starting from fresh but i feel even with all the free lc and dlc and three other games why not one with all races or three with all races why spread it out this game will never feel fleshed out after fighting and annihalating a few factions of different races it starts to feel stale because you continue onto the next one and bam you realise you may as well be fighting the greenskins again because this is exactly the same this really bothers me because it feels like they are just saving the rest to put out dlc s i know i know a lot of people complain about ca and their dlc s i ve never been one to complain about this in previous games because the original game had meat so it was justifiable but taking out things like unfortified settlement battles why ca why ffs makes each battle and siege pretty samey ya know i love the game but i also kinda hate it i also don t understand why they would lock such a huge part of the game chaos behind a dlc i just pray that when the dlc factions arrive please be tomb kings we need more undead factions this game starts to feel more diverse and fleshy i apologise to anyone who may disagree this is just how i feel i wouldn t reccomend this game in it s current state definatly not worth 40 i would wait it out until a sale where you can buy this game and all the god forsaken dlc s for the games current full price final verdict you should buy this game now if your a fan of total war and of warhammer if your fairly indifferent and don t mind waiting for a year or so for the dlc etc to be mostly released i would wait for a sale if your a total war fan but not of warhammer or never heard of warhammer don t worry the empire is a human faction that they have created for people like you they have family tree and a very varied unit roster very similar to the previous games and better diplomacy options if your excited for a different style of gamepad i would advise vampire counts as they are the most unique faction and have really cool abilities and units if you take them i advise taking mannfred as he will make it a lot easier for you to get into the feel of the faction but otherwise i would always take kemmler as his raise dead reduction with grave digger means you don t even need any military buildings most of the time if you fight a few huge battles which gives you instant access to most units without a turn wait seriously he can be so op don t make the mistake of thinking they are another twilight vampire lover boy they are brutal don t be afraid of the change in direction because this is a good game it s just not what i had personally hoped for i love total war and i love warhammer but as a whole i do not love this game i have also made a few comparison s between this game and previous games i would like to say that i am in no way saying this game should have everything and more that the previous titles have included this is a new game and going in a different direction and following the warhammer lore and not the total war lore i am also aware i have used a lot of brackets and gone off course a few times so i apologies for any confusion dlong live the warhammer universep s they really should have named this total warhammer don t you think
