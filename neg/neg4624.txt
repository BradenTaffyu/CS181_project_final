2019 with 25 year of civ experience i am very sorry to say i am done with franchise because that is the only thing that is left here franchise civ was not supposed to become yet another 4x click o mania title it was always setting limits higher and higher yet now i see one man band indie games that are almost up to par vs entire corporation budget ffs and i even had to download a pirated version in order to play since steam one is not working civ iv is still working from its original install over 10 yrs ago ffs lost any devs recently not to say that the game itself is bad it is quite good as strategy games go but civilization title must live up to certain standards that are apparently forgotten dear old mr sid anybody else find themselves stuck at colonize from 1994 and civilization i iv i would gladly pay 100s of eur just for a licence for good old colonize for timeless and pricelless fun i had i will never pay another eur for this franchise dlc crap thing
