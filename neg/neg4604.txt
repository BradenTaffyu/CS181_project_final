2016 i ve been playing civilization for 25 years and there are no other game that i enjoy more to play i m perfectly aware that all civs have problems on release and over the time they always made it perfect i m counting with it too on this one and i believe that civilization vi will become a great game but at this point the game is not yet playable it s very nice in the first hours but soon the lack of a zoom out and the huge icons bad designed and placed over the units will turn it into an annoying experience wait a few months if you want to play it but at this point it feels more like a good game in an early beta test with an awfully childish design
