2018 i want to reccomend this game but i can t the 2 0 update has been alright but it just hasnt done it for me the switch to hyperlane only is something ive wanted for a while but now it takes so much time to travel anywhere due to your fleet having to traverse the system which makes wars impossible as the ai will simply continously run away from your fleet if its slight stronger than theirs this makes front line combat impossible the new war exhaustion system just blows my mind as to why they implemented it you gain attrition for doing nothing if you settle status quo you get the systems youve conquered but they also get the same thing once exhaustion is at 100 it forces you to settle status quo so you typically wont have time to get those systems back if you want to play against retarded ai then this is the game for you game is fun af but its annoying to play against dumb aiwar exhaustion is still as as ever ai seem to take less and if you hold your borders you just get attrioned until they force their war goals ai seem to get buffs to all their ships out of nowhere ai can spawn fleets out of nowhere resources out of thin air ive looked at ai planets and they are a mess with little to no production they constantly have rebelions establishing embassies with ai does nothing because they revoke it straight away even on the easiest dificulties with scaling turned off they cheat maybe im trash at the game but it seems like they didnt put any thought on the at the game
