early access review avoid at all costs the devs wildcard and publisher snail do not deserve your support or money i bought this game due to the roadmap the roadmap which turned out to be completely fictional constant delays swapping of maps due to be released terrible communication of planned server shutdowns and overall terrible execution of bug fixes at every turn even as someone who loves the concept and spent a lot of time in survival evolved i would tell my past self to not bother giving these crooks money they focus on paid mods and pay to win concepts more than actually releasing maps that they promised do not buy
