2023 the good fast paced naval battles with good looking ship models an easy to understand hud easy to learn hard to master some loving details on the maps like historical civilian ships animal and plant live the not so good most maps follow the same pattern at higher tiers they look different but are still the same lots and lots of ships that are pure fiction plenty of them would never have been able to set sail the way they are in world of warships too fast too much armor beyond the technical capabilities of the nation at that time there seems to be a clear bias in favor of the russian navy their ships are among the best in the game in almost every category and they get all the good toys consumables the bad submarines their gameplay was pressed into main game after wargaming admitted after two years of testing that they can t get their balance right ever since then wargaming did not touch them again but will introduce a russian line soon with specs even modern atomic submarines could only dream of aircraft carriers they can strike you from every distance and out of perfect cover with near impunity lost planes are regenerated a single ships anti air defenses are usually no deterent they have automated anti submarine defenses and don t burn or flood for more than a few seconds wargaming has left their un balance alone for even longer than the submarines the balance in general as already mentioned some nations are treated better than others glaring balance issues even if mentioned by the testers wargaming hires from within the community the so called supertesters will often not be fixed before a ship is released in some cases it will never be fixed as new ships are then balanced against the old you get a spiral of ever more powerful ships wargaming does do balance adjustments but way to few and in the case of russian ships way to tame ones if at all the ugly wargaming monetization a single premium ship can cost more than a full collectors edition aaa game ingame events where you can work towards getting a supposeldy free ship often need a money boost or it is impossible to complete them and that s just the tip of the iceberg see the grind if cig sees any chance to make money out of an event they will take it they will also hide this scheme as best they can with premium tokens you can get for a premium currency which you can get for real money for example you will always be able to get some tokens for free but never enough wargaming communication community managers seem to exist to keep the community in check to prevent uprisings and to defend all company decisions however bad those truly are wargaming will tell you one thing one day and do the opposite of it the next it s been now at least three times since they promised improvement in their communication and acknowleding the communities wishes unless there is extreme pressure they will always forget about that promise within a few days for the next event whatever they said or promised previously it will all be back to business as usual for them the grind missions unless you have just the right ships for the task forget about completing missions for free ships fast or at all you don t own a fast firing gun destroyer good luck getting those 1100 main gun hit ribbons you might need it will take you 30 battles 8 10 hours of gameplay and this is just going to be one step of six for a single phase out of four to six with ever increasing demands those tasks are created with those players in mind who already have everything and who have the best premium economy booster only available for real money and not to be confused with event boosters at the ready the casual free to play users will never have a chance unless they give up on everything else in their lives only smaller rewards like cosmetics are easy to get even getting through a single line of researchable ships will take you a very long time in both experience necessary for the next upgrade and credits to earn to buy and equip the ships
