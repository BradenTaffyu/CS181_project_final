2022 update until the developers can solve all the crashing or atleast give players the option to rejoin as this is 2022 and that s very doable then i still do not recommend this game few updates ago the gameplay was enjoyable and stable now there s constant crashing and freezing original review you re going to miss a lot of missing mechanics in this version that were available in 2 and 3 2 had better formations and combat protocols 3 had amazing mechanics and i really enjoyed the care packages you could order miss those features this is still a good game with unique features itself however i wouldn t purchase it in it s current condition unless it s on sale
