2023 i wouldn t recommend this game for a single reason first of all the good and theres a lot of good this game looks great it s fun got a large roster of dinos you get a lot of freedom in how you build and things like terrain tools are more intuitive than other similar games you might think this is a copy and paste of the first game and let me tell you it really isn t however where this game really shines is sandbox the enclosures when you have freedom can look incredible and the sandbox options are so diverse you can play the game how you want so why don t i recommend this game after all this one particular bug that causes you to lose hours of work this seems to happen mostly in sandbox where all of a sudden your dinosaurs just stop moving stop eating stop drinking and eventually die it doesn t seem to be connected with number of dinosaurs present this has happened on every single one of my 4 sandbox parks all after ive put 10 hours into a park this is devastating when it happens because there is no fix reloading is very temporary and usually they bug again after a couple of minutes the only solution is to start a new park this bug has been in the game since launch and has still not been fixed and there is no communication from the developers on whether this is ever going to be addressed frontier have made some cracking games but this is a blot on their record i would not recommend this game based on a game breaking glitch for sandbox and should this ever be fixed i will revise my review
