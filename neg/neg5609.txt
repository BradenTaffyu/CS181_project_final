2015 empire feels well polished in comparison even after many many patches it never addressed the root of many of the problems which is the warscape engine itself it was tailor made to simulate early modern line infantry warfare not roman maniples or greek phallanxes as such shields get waved around like theyre made of foam and the combat itself lacks weight this wasnt a big issue in empire napoleon since there were few dedicated melee units and most bayonet charges were brief exchanges meant to break the enemy with pure shock rather than killing power the lack of weight is most apparent with cavalry when in rome 1 charging a cataphract into infrantry sent the front ranks flying and often times immediatly broke said unit yes there are mods that can fix certain things but they cant fix the underlying problems like the engine you should not buy a game based on the fact that there are mods to fix it the vanilla game needs to be able to stand up on its own as a satisfactory experience to be worth your money
