2018 edit the bugs are my favourite part hahahahhahahaahahahahaathere was a time when bethesda cared about their players and the games they released but now they just shove out whatever they can pasted over a previous game they don t even properly support modding anymore they use havok for animations which is no longer available to the public because it was bought out by microsoft and they re pushing so hard for creation club to be a thing that they break 3rd party modding sites with every update if you want a single player pseudo rpg shooter that you can mod new weapons into it s okay if you re hoping for new experiences beyond the game that skyrim and new vegas gave you look somewhere else also they voiced the player character so anything to do with modders making a new story is immediately out the window and you no longer feel like you re the player but instead feel like you re playing someone else the music is good though so it s got that going for it
