2020 for me arma 3 has not been a good experience to many annoyances dlc mixed into the game menues every where no way to disable this as far as i know meaning i had to try and error on what i can play same in workshop an this is really important because if you get arma 3 without dlc you ll soon want to download more content if you play single player unless you want to make missions in eden editor where dlc content is also mixed in in souch a way that you can t easily excluded it to me this is to big a turn off i ended up using more time figuring out how to get a good experience then to actually play i also joined a few mp servers caos and tk on spawn perhaps i should see if there s still an active arma 2 community i had good times back then playing evolution
