2020 early access review raft is a survival game where you gather resources from the sea and from various islands you encounter to build a raft to explore the world the main qualities of the game are the early game where every broken raft and island you encounter is a treat and instills a sense of wonder and where you are gathering just enough resources to afford some tool or another square to your raft the music the fact that you can play with multiple people on your raft especially that last part helped me get through this game unfortunately the amount of content is on the low side even after 2 years of early access the story consists of 5 story islands with story elements that only losely tie together after the initial rush to get food and water going the game turns into a giant resource grind where you go through entire chests of wood at a time and have to visit a lot of islands to get enough metal to finally stop the shark eating your raft every single waking moment achievements are lackluster and mostly just statistics for the devs i feel since update 12 the second chapter october 2020 there is a bit of automation you can focus on but not nearly as much as i would want since update 13 the renovation update june 2021 there is an adequate amount of customisation with a reasonable amount of furniture and decoration options the story still makes very little sense overall i think the game is light on content even after 2 years of early access i have a lot of time in this game mainly because i use it to hang out with coworkers the game has little more than a day or two of actual gameplay in it if you focus on the story and progression if you are willing to grind out achievements and build the most over the top raft you can manage you can spend a lot more time in this game if you like survival games i recommend buying it on sale if you intend to get all achievements be prepared to grind for hundreds of hours visiting the same type of island over and over killing the same 4 types of enemies over and over note updated this review in september 2021 to reflect the added content in update 13 overall i still recommend buying this game on sale
