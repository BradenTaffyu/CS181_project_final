2017 in short wait to buy the game until several patches from now maybe six months maybe until an enhanced edition comes out in long if you played the first game this one is a bit of a disappointment there were some questionable gameplay design changes the institution of the armour system is not ideal to say the least and the streamlining of the stat system loses more than it makes up in ease of use i think other people have explained it better than i can so i ll sum it up physical magical armour prevents any damage or status effects from any source be it directly applied or environmental defence abilities such as willpower that would protect against certain types of status afflictions from the last game have been removed certain attribute stats such as speed have also been removed the dynamic action point system of the last game has been removed skills from the last game copy pasted in description and effect suddenly have a higher cost requirement that enemy npcs often don t have to pay all of these changes have the sum of making the combat much more constricted and much less dynamic and many times means one fight to another is virtually identical i personally wouldn t consider that to be a positive nor negative if not for one thing enemies have none of the same restrictions as you enemies lack cooldowns and have universal access to skills you don t enemies can create surfaces and status afflictions like cursed surfaces acid plague that entirely ignore your armour enemies have more action points than you and they have a higher max action point threshold every enemy has a teleport ability some can use every turn and they have a farther range than you so some fights consist of using all your action points to run up to an enemy only for them to teleport run farther away than you can run then casting something at you enemies have a large amount of free movement and many skills cost less ap for them alone in most fights enemies start in the most advantageous positions possible if you re trying to do the quests in the order they re intended to be done oh also all enemies are psychic on every difficulty level if you re an undead even if you re hiding your identity expect to be healed which will do a good amount of damage to you if someone uses the permafrost skill which makes you immune to damage except when it doesn t because some enemies can still damage you with certain skills which isn t mentioned in the skill description and heals you for any damage taken all enemies will ignore the character with the permafrost effect if a character has a higher weakness to a certain damage type than another all enemies will focus on that damage type expect to say several times that s cheating i don t mean to say the game is hard it s not really which is fine by my standards but these systems have not been studied and so it s glaring and annoying when unintended consequences happen one such unintended consequence only one or two skill trees are valid above certain thresholds if and i mean if bugs haven t severely limited their usefulness the way the system is designed all magic damage as it is elemental stands a chance of healing the enemy and as physical magical armour is divided an effective team should use one and not the other to avoid chipping away at two different healthpools with no overlap physical damage cannot be resisted nor healed melee characters must spend valuable action points to get into melee and all enemies are equipped with a cooldown less teleport so this is inefficient the inequality between different skill trees and builds becomes unavoidable and especially annoying end game i m also not a big fan of the borderlands esque entirely randomised no exceptions loot system in an rpg if my character is given a weapon that is supposedly designed to kill a god i d expect it to not be a sidegrade for this pitchfork i found in a lucky wooden box a few minutes ago i get testy when all my strength based gear gives me intelligence points oof end game let s jump there i m not wholly sure the developers fully beta tested or bug fixed the entire second half of the game if they did at all certain higher level skills literally literally do not work netherswap one of the rare teleports in the game generates line of sight errors no matter what no matter what you cannot use the skill at the moment of writing this because no matter where or what you re teleporting you can t see it my character with netherswap apparently couldn t see herself to teleport herself okay so that s combat gameplay it doesn t end there certain quests cannot start nor finish depending on the order of your dialogue choices i do not mean i ll gouge your eyes out dialogue choices a quest in the last zone doesn t start if you ask a woman if she s doing ok before you ask about her missing husband another quest in the last zone doesn t start if you happened to read a certain book before talking to a quest relevant npc you d think your character might care to mention perhaps this npc is about to be murdered by this other npc no such luck bigger bugs are still in the game too certain circumstances can suddenly make your characters unable to interact with objects or talk to npcs essential npcs will disappear entirely from your map saves still get permanently corrupted unintentionally unkillable enemy mobs don t play multiplayer more bugs back to quests your journal often doesn t update with recent quest progress or it updates inaccurately saying you did things you didn t or didn t do things you did at one point my quest told me my romantically entangled companion betrayed me and tried to end the world bit of a mixup that even npcs get confused and will talk to you as if you picked options you did not this gets bothersome when the npcs are so enraged by the actions you didn t take that they try to kill you many quests will never close or resolve unless you kill one of the quest essential characters thus never giving you a reward god forbid you move onto the next area because that will close your quest and then will say you ignored it abandoned it and assume you did the worst things possible actually i don t know what s worse when leaving resolves the quest negatively or when the quest never resolves staying open and unresolved through the literal epilogue i had two quests from act 2 do that even if the combat design stayed true to the first game and the bugs got swept up if you enjoyed the rpg elements of the first game you re going to be a bit disappointed in dos2 many quests give no choices though imply there should be more than one and if you choose to follow the quest you ll find npcs become furious with you for being forced to pick the only resolution available the main quest mandates a course of action in the first act that will immediately make half of the npcs on the map hostile on sight to you the main quest often mandates then makes unavoidable incredibly unethical or stupid mechanics decision chains that will prevent progress if you refuse you re going to be eating people s souls and consigning them to oblivion whether you want to or not bub you were a fool for not seeing the big bad s super evil ambush and you were a fool for doing nothing even if you saw it a mile away because they somehow got into an area they couldn t have gotten into and suddenly you re knocked down and immobilised and the big bad got away you idiot npcs will gank dialogue characters at random hope you didn t invest in persuasion on your main character i still had fun just too much annoyance for a 45 usd game
