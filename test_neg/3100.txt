2018 single player gameplay and story is a great step up from previous gtas otherwise gto is a place where rampant hackers and scripters somehow pass the totally legit meter by rockstar s standards i mean i ran into a guy with 1000 yes one thousand kdr how the hell does that pass the lowest standard for blatantly hacking jerkoff that doesn t even require fancy cheat detection algorhithms or player reports to figure out that took common sense which rockstar is severely lacking
