2023 i want so badly to be able to recommend this game but i simply cannot whoever is directing this latest trend with the total war franchise is milking the good reputation of the series for profit and eroding any good will their audience might have left over from the initial joy of seeing a game made with so much effort put into it leaving negative reviews is not enough if they are laughing all the way to the bank one must simply stop buying products that are not worth the money go outside watch a film or play an old total war game instead i won t be buying the latest dlcs until ca is done milking this property and valve starts flogging them for 80 off and i suggest you do the same
