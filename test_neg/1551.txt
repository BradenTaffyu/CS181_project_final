i can t recommend this tldr if you haven t bought this game already don t just stick with tww2 it works better and the new factions aren t worth it with over 2 thousand hours in the second game and a little over two hundred in the first as well as every dlc ca has put out for them this game makes me done with the total war warhammer games i ve played the ice queen the chaos dwarves the northern provinces and the shockingly obese and before i got the game on steam i played on game pass where i finished off a prince of chaos and skarbrand campaign so i ve touched on all the new factions the new order factions are meh and the new chaos factions are really fun but the main issue is the ai the ai was almost a deal breaker in tww2 they make really terrible decisions don t know how to correctly build settlements or defend their territory and still prioritize the player which would be fine if they could take other threats into account i had grimgor declare war on me while having his capitol threatened by kholek suneater i was able to ambush one army take out the other by leaving someone to defend my settlement and after i took five of his settlements kohlek came in and wiped him out why is the ai bad enough to let this happen the battle ai hasn t been fixed either units sometimes refuse to stay in formation they sometimes will not go where you tell them to if any units are in contact they tend to ignore most of your orders to fight the unit they re in contact with which is terrible news for cavalry the ranged ai got much worse as they sometimes just won t fire even with clear line of sight and within range at one point i had an artillery unit stop firing at a target that hadn t moved when i tried to make it fire at that target again they decided they needed to rush it and other times they will just be standing idle after you gave them and order to attack a unit that is not fleeing or broken just moving away the enemy ai for sieges was never fixed and is still extremely easy and i ve broken the enemy ai a few times like when i was fighting zombies and they didn t know how to line up so they just kept moving back and forth on their line while i peppered them with artillery shots it went on like that till i was out of aty ammo then rushed in and they barely fought back it s still not worth it to make any allies until you ve cleaned out most of the potential enemies around you the benefit of being able to build their units is kinda cool but the downside of being at war with everyone they are at war with outweighs it by a good bit they did add the ability to trade land so that s an awesome change you no longer have to sit with one useless settlement in a region and can now gift that settlement to a faction for a relations boost nice they won t use it to improve themselves in any way because again the ai can t build settlements but it was still a great addition so yeah it doesn t improve anything and the new factions aren t worth it i would say wait for a fix but i ve been waiting two years and i m done waiting
