2018 usually i dont do reviews on steam about games but rockstars greed and rockstars support impotence made me unstoppable to not throw out my feelings so i remember first time gta v was announced to pc i was excited as huge gta franchise fan intrigued that finaly i would not need to dream about playstation to play one of best games ever that was huge pricy but huge loved it anyway ordered a pre order with some huge bonuses here in steam for quite a lot for that time for game enjoyed first i enjoyed game really much liked it loved it played it a lot but real life took my attention and gta v and especially gta v online hours reduced till i was legit to say im not playing it anymore so few weeks before i write this review i returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade purchase and amazing new content even got new friends since my old friends was not playing gta v anymore started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content that meant playing mc stuff selling bunker stuff researching bunker stuff playing heists and everything since my cars was so slow and not top notch couldnt afford compatable for racing so far so good yeah i always was aginst cheating public looby modders always f k things up bomb you remotely engage pvp with god mode or etc simply hated it till i found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you perfect my return will be easier in such community i will need few less weeks to get desired items some members are rich and lets test me newest cars my best was zentorno and osiris t20 too but there wooow buggati chiron like car and it cost millions so community players see that i cannot afford even security on my mc businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account i usually didnt have more than 1 5 million in game cash and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high 75 nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa got 3 7 millions in game cash tought about what to buy and since it was late evening went to sleep with idea that tomorrow i will choose what of desired content i will buy got really excited about community and game again fully returning to play it sounds too good yes today its evening of the day i wanted to choose what to buy i recieve email that ive been bad boy by violationg terms of service eula and i got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted devasted at beginning not really even tought phe ive have done nothing bad didnt cheat whatever it must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that rockstar should be fixing that so with good willing made ticket in rockstar support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments ive been earned so far some of them for example my first supercar zentorno more than few years old guess what they auto close this kind of ticket okay thought thats a bug so i got live chat with support and explained what halppened and first line of support just say he cant help me there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what he was not able to say just that its violation of tos eula as experienced customer support guy i understand first line guys problem and tell okay please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text i will not tell why you got banned its not without reason im shocked even angry i paid at that time 60 for game devasted support should not be so bad but then i started reading reviews and internet about everything and i see a lot complains about banning innocent players yet i remember how was going in random public lobby if not blown appart then caged with some modder and then me who hard work in game cash to get desired car and now this my gta v online character will be deleted all my cars will be deleted how i feel about it im devasted paid for game and i will be honest online part of game is last that im in there for since single player i have been 100 completed on xbox360 and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded i keep asking why rockstar is doing this my only guess would be that 60 i have paid to them ofc steam takse some part so tehnicly a bit less is not enough or they want more you would ask how i become to this illuminati theory just keeped asking why ofc i have another steam accounts and by cs go items played that game for more thousands of hours i can sell i can easaly earn those 20 and not be about all unfairness of rockstar here but im man with principles and i can publicy tell no rockstar i will not pay you more to get content i already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of what to do next sue rockstar nah i readed tos eula and terms i have checked checkbox that i agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that rockstar is simply abusing me forget no im man of principle wait 30 days and start from zero probably at this point thats only thing i have left and apparently i will return to game but probably it will take for me more than 30 days for that just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but i still love this game yet i understand that developer company and support is softly saying bad at this point im really glad that i never bought any shark cards and i will never buy extra copy of gta v on other accounts to pay extra to rockstar over and dissapointed
