2023 setting aside the politics of whats going on at ca and dlc cost etc etc ill get to that at the end i simply don t like warhammer 3 as much as warhammer 2 now perhaps its nostalgia and i didn t like warhammer 2 as much as the first game until the larger map with warhammer 1 factions came out i think i m generally just less interested in all the demons and the factions which aren t demons don t excite me as much and adding the full map didn t ignite the passion to play the game more for me this time around it s a solid game and will provide entertainment my game play hasn t really been effected by bugs etc i was just really hyped and i don t like it as much as i thought i would end of as for the politics like almost everything in life the capacity for profit and the satisfaction of shareholders is more important than the end user or customer i have accepted it as the norm with almost every other aspect of life so why not gaming too there is no solution other than bloody revolution off with their heads and the end of capitalism since a civil uprising of the gamer seems unlikely a high percentage are too high to be bothered i guess ill just have to deal with being ripped off and such is life in 2023 it seems if you want this to change vote for someone who wants more even wealth distribution in society which i didn t as i was too busy playing warhammer 2 if you don t do that its hard to have the moral high ground to complain
