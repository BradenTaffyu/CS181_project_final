2017 do i love this game yes i really do can i recommend it to new players no to put it in a rather crass way killers are in a toxic abusive relationship with the devs time after time we re treated like clowns by the development team given something cool to play with only for it to be nerf hammered into oblivion for every crutch we get the survivors get 10 we get a neat perk survivors get voi survive with friends and skype hangouts discord gives the survivors a psychic link which demonstrably breaks the game we get an edge the survivors cry and cry and the devs listen to them the survivor community has been babied and spoiled for months and at this point killers are just tired many have uninstalled i play less and less with every update since it feels like the devs don t care main issues swf breaks the game the devs know this but fear a backlash or drop in sales or popularity if the devs let us choose wether we face survive with friends or not then i ll remove this killer perks have been nerfed repeatedly because anything half decent is labelled as a game breaking op power devs nerfect iron grasp because it was so overused instead they should have asked why does every killer feel like they need iron grasp killers are repeatedly nerfed since survivors refuse to adapt to them and learn this is unfair and makes us feel unwanted survivors can block killers they don t like on mlga and this is toxic third party software is being allowed ban it i love this game for so many reasons and it hurts me that i have to leave a negative review i hope that someday i can update this to reflect what the game should be and give it a positive score
