2016 edit2 rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program it disables itself online it has no effects for hackers it s just for modding sp they are trying to stop it to drive more people to online and microtransactions their reason was that openiv allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the gta online experience openiv does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try why are people still supporting rockstar edit these problems seem to be ocurring less by now but i m leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of rockstar people are being banned for no reason and rockstar agrees with them yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help using discord fraps any third party framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned and support will not reverse it heck if you buy shark cards and they don t work they won t even refund you for that do not support awful business practices like this their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money edit a lot of people seem to be taking this as waaaah i got banned so let me clear things up i have not been banned i uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and i didn t play it much for those who don t believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned here are a few more reasons why you shouldn t support r there is a limitless amount of bugs for online ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once you being booted for no reason connections timing out randomly all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen i have ever seen instead of presenting you with a simple you have timed out the game instead spends much time loading up single player puts you into the world and then gives you an error message with an option to rejoin which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are that s a good 2 5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game it is incredibly easy to fix but rockstar still haven t because they do not care there is no server browser this means that with the endless adversary modes they add all are dead within a week the only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level which almost never works and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session if you are playing free roam would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won t have many players i thought as much thus the modes die off extremely quickly and finally the anticheat is still terrible you can have people flying around the map spawning props locking you in place dropping money bags on everyone which in an amusing way can result in them getting banned and just generally causing havoc every attempt rockstar has made has resulted in false positives and an extremely intolerant system towards modders you remember how much rockstar said they loved the pc audience and their modders that s amusing considering they re filling the game with dummy code to confuse them and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files in all do not support a developer who does not care about their audience they release modes the recent further adventures in finance and felony update is a great case for this that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money or buy shark cards to make it all easier not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort as again they ll be dead within a few weeks you will be better off supporting another company move on
