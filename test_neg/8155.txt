2023 insane amount of depth lots of variety and there s nothing quite like it out there that s noita and yet there are some design decisions here at play which will make it or break it for you i m not recommending the game because after 65 hours i haven t managed to even reach the final boss and trying to do so stopped being fun and while the classic adage losing is fun very much applies in this game i laughed many times after a particularly explosive death and even recorded gifs after a while i felt nothing but frustration since i just didn t feel like i m in control of my run now i m perfectly happy to be told skill issue git gut skrub and i d agree to an extent but hey i managed to get to the last area which only 12 of players have the achievement for doing so i think that perhaps this is not just a me problem anyway i have three main complaints about the game i believe all of them to be conscious design decisions which some people might like some people might not read the wikido you like games chock full of secrets that you have almost no chance of figuring out on your own and enjoy the community aspect of solving mysteries aka hanging out on forums discord servers and reading wikis this is such a game here are some vague spoiler free examples of what i mean many things require some specific obscure and very difficult feats to unlock there are many mechanics in the game that are only vaguely hinted at in stuff that normally would already be considered secretive and some mechanics aren t mentioned at all the only way to find out about them is either by accident or by reading about them and then there s the worst thing the sheer scope of noita is something that you ll probably never find out about by just playing the game normally in an intuitive way that s what makes me believe that noita is explicitly designed to be this way it s no coincidence in case this isn t clear i really don t like such design to me getting info from the wiki is like reading the detailed plot summary of the movie before watching it gaming is and always will be a solitary personal experience for me unless playing coop or something i know many disagree so just thought i d mention this here life is short game is longthe second problem is somewhat visible in the trailer it s astonishingly easy to die and not necessarily due to the enemies although that too absolutely you can misuse a spell get caught up in an explosion fall into a lethal liquid such as lava point is you re rather squishy and while there is a way to increase your hp it s tedious and somewhat random for the most part it s possible to avoid this issue with being very careful how careful well almost every step into the unknown has to be done slowly and methodically and groups of enemies are best avoided altogether unless you have some kind of big bada boom spell for that occasion fight them one two at a time from familiar ground hey no big deal that sounds just like dark souls and that was fun right here s the thing the game world is huge if you intend to explore in order to get better wands and health pickups as well as farm some gold to get better spells all of which you should completing even a single area can be quite tedious all because of how easy it is to die you have to be careful but there s so much ground to cover and that s only talking about playing the game normally mind over and over againand now for the final issue i mentioned that the game has crazy amount of depth and variety early on and yet in spite of this almost every run feels very samey there is a lot of cool enemies different spells that combine in crazy ways and so much more and yet because of how difficult the game is and how easy it is to die early on chances are you ll never see any of those things 90 of my runs ended before things got interesting and after a while you look in the mirror and ask yourself am i willing to start another run considering how big of a chance there is i ll die before things get good and you answer yes you promise yourself you ll be extra careful this time you take things even slower than before and you get a little further maybe or maybe it doesn t matter because you simply can t find a good wand or proper perk combination etc etc so you still die same as before even though individual areas are procedurally generated they re still made of recognisable pieces and after a while you ll almost be able to predict the layout okay not quite but so many setpieces repeat and considering how demanding this game is when it comes to repetition you ll end up running into the same stuff over and over conclusionwait that s all you have to say you did nothing but complain i m sure you re thinking and you know yes i did because in the end all the goodwill i had for noita goodwill that my first few hours generated melted away by those three fun killing issues do you like reading the wiki do you like classic roguelikes where successful runs can be many hours long are you fine with repetition then noita has a lot to offer you me well i think i made my opinion known curator page
