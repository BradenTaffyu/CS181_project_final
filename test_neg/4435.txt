2021 this game is a grindy mess to start with and has time gates a feature i absolutely despise but can be fun at times in my opinion this not the reason i am leaving this negative review though because some guy traded fraudulent platinum this game s premium currency to me without my knowledge it was then removed from account which is understandable but my account was suspended for having a negative platinum balance they permanently suspended my account because i performed an in game trade with another individual and the only way to restore it is to give them money which makes no sense to me it also would put my account at risk for a permanent ban because if someone trades fraudulent platinum to me again my account is permanently even if i didn t know the platinum is fraudulent
