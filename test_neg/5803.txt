2020 i actually have owned this game for 5 years but only through uplay ubisoft actually made me purchase it a second time and bind my account to another product key just to play through steam i have over 1000 hours in game this game literally has bugs every single patch that are game breaking there is not a single update that comes out that doesn t come riddled with bugs that ruin the entire competitive aspect of the game there are literally too many to count shield bugs audio bugs gadget bugs shrapnel bugs headshot bugs killcam bugs drone bugs hitbox bugs google any of those and you ll see a litany of people complaining about them and then there s the cheaters my god ubisoft claims their iteration of battleeye is the best anti cheat on the planet but good lord that is the worst lie ever told by a developer it seriously gives todd howard a run for his money i have never seen so many blatant cheaters in a game in my life and i ve been playing online games for almost 16 years i play with a cheater that is below level 50 and maintains a k d and w l ratio above 20 0 almost every week there are so many cheaters that out of my 10 preliminary ranked matches last season void edge 4 of my games mmr scores were rescinded because a cheater was detected in one of each of them the anti cheat is laughable the game is fun but there is way too much wrong with it to make it enjoyable i really do like this game but it s a damn mess i think it s also worth mentioning this is by far the worst community of gamers ever to grace the earth and ubisoft does next to nothing to stop it i think a year ago they made it so you re banned for saying derogatory words in chat but now you just have people either screaming it in the voip or using characters to type it in chat it really subverts nothing and reporting them does nothing about 50 of my casual matches involve a team member getting into an argument with another team member and then one of them getting team killed i am not joking when i say nearly every quick match i play has blatant team killing by my team mates or the other team the voip is filled with screaming or racism almost all the time and reporting players seems to do nothing i will report more than 1 player almost every match for team griefing killing or cheating and that is not a joke whatsoever i ve even taken the time to personally report tickets to ubisoft to see if it makes a genuine difference and it doesn t ubisoft runs a broken game with a horribly toxic community and they really don t seem to care they re more focused on the next set of cosmetic skins branded with pro league team names or some sloppy battle pass than actually addressing the myriad of problems this game has that make it unbearable for most players the gameplay itself is solid when the audio isn t bugged or people aren t shooting you with pinpoint accuracy through the front of a raised riot shield but as a conscious purchase decision i can not in good faith recommend someone waste money on it
