2021 how to charge for a game and noone complains1 allow cheaters and do nothing about it2 charge for prime account3 profit the crowd not only doesnt complain but applauds for the anti cheating measuresso out of nowhere you make everyone who is bellow rank 21 to have to pay 15 to get prime if someone is rank 20 and needs only few games to reach the free prime i saw a guy who just needed 100 exp thats ridiculous gets literally nothing but someone that got the rank just before the update gets a free 15 prime thats some weird logic the least they could do is give a discount to the ranks that were close to 21 according to how close they were another thing is to make everyone who got their prime without paying to have to buy it but since it was your policy to give a free prime you should give the discount otherwise the game is actually nice if you mute the mostly toxic chat and get used to finding games without cheaters but hey now you can pay 15 and you get decent matches without cheaters at least not so much that we previously didnt care about and they probably still dont they just hope they will buy multiple accounts more profit
