2023 used to enjoy this game but it has gotten incredibly tryhard y and toxic the kind of interactions i ve seen in this game sometimes make cod lobbies seem like kindergarten every once in a while i try to get back into it to play it casually a bit with friends just to have fun but it seems that this game can only really be played in a highly competitive manner due to the extremely short ttk playerbase and just generally how the game works if you re really into that you might enjoy it but it s just too competitive and sweaty for me where even casual matches feel like hardcore ranked if you don t give it your all every second you won t really stand a chance and even if you do you will likely get sniped from a small hole in a wall somewhere on the other side of the map there s unfortunately a multitude of such gameplay oversights that can make the game quite hard to enjoy sometimes add to this the generally highly toxic playerbase and you have a game that i can unfortunately not recommend anymore
