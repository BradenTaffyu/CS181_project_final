2023 the fact that for 7 years you were allowed to share dlc characters and then all of a sudden boom you cant no more is ridiculous other steam games still allow you to dlc share when both parties own the base game because its a policy that s not even enforced this is just a way for bhvr to make more money off people buying their lost shared dlc characters
