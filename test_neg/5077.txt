2023 boycott activision hey can we discuss the recent issues with activision and voice our concerns i m disappointed with their decision to remove the nickmercs operator bundle from modern warfare 2 and warzone because of a post he made regarding an lgbt protest it feels like activision is supporting the indoctrination of kids with lgbt content which i find concerning their response about celebrating pride seems tone deaf especially considering the toxic environment often found in cod lobbies with racial slurs and profanity additionally the sexual assault allegations against activision are deeply troubling and their yearly release of overpriced games doesn t help i ve decided not to buy any more cod games and i recommend others to uninstall their existing games let s show activision that we won t support them financially anymore
