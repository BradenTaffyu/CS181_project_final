2017 i bought this game three weeks ago specifically because of it s large and active modding community it was for me it s main selling point yet hardly had i delved into adding any mods when the producers of this game went out of there way to destroy the modding community i had just finished the single player campaign and was preparing to jump into the online community when all this occured now i have no interest in giving a single coin to this company playing it s online money farm or continue to play it s oft neglected single player game still waiting on any single player dlc and i will avoid purchasing from this company in the future
