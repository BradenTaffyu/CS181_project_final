after folding and upgrading further the game is now playable however it does have freezing occasionally and still crashing on vocation equip learn screen graphically the rt has some shimmering and shadows don t always display correctly graphics at max the game feels like it has many missing beats and many threads of the story are just forgotten it feels incomplete to me i d suggest holding off until a complete version is released at least giving time for more fixes and more content they most definitely will release some manner of definitive version at some point what with dd being a recognized game in capcom s eyes that made them a lot of money
