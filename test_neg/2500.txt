2021 too many cheaters ranked mode is like punishing yourself and badges require insane grinds season passes mostly contain skins that are literal vomit similar color and patterns etc and all round you re going to be part of the 99 of players that are there just to make up the numbers they re also constantly trying to get you to play arena s to farm for limited rares thus inflating the arena play percentage when i m sure a majority doesn t like it once again due to cheaters and even worse in this mode smurfs lastly they will ban your account for 72h for dropping one f bomb but cannot and will not ban players that spam the f word 1000 times in a row on the microphone or other stuff additional note if you re a belgium player good luck as they gouge out these players specifically if you want a collection event skin it s over 400 to buy the coins to get all skins and thus a heirloom i m sure they ve got a hidden dial that turns off heirloom odds for any belgium players so they can milk that demographic wallet bigtime
