2019 tldr new launcher prevents game from launching recently decided i wanted to play some more and noticed it seems they ve added a different launcher to a game that already had one there s three external programs including steam to launch the game worst part is the game doesn t actually launch either the button in rockstar s launcher directs to steam which directs to the launcher the first time i tried the game did launch but crashed immediately after the intro sequence single player was good wish i could actually play it again
