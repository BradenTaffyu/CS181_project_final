2023 they care more about selling dlc than making the ai work at the very least they could fix the ai movement cheating there s no reason why the enemy should be able to take city after city replenishing its own troops the whole way along while i cant catch up to them even in forced march its such a waste of time to have a play through completely ruined because the ai relies on blatant cheating to stay in the game edit all these clown awards lmao imagine cheerleading for the corpos you mad you mad you mad you sad you sad you sad
