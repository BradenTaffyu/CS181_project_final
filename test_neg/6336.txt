2019 i don t recommend playing dead by daylight at this time the devs have added dedicated servers to the game which needs a lot more work i play both killer and survivor and i m seeing issues on both ends people being disconnected and given the dc penalty the last straw for me i played a game as killer took 10 mins to find a game got a 4 man slugged last survivor closed the hatch and as i hung the last survivor the game froze for a second then said i disconnected so i lost all of my points that game lost my rank and lost my add ons i used for that match
