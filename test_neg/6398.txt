i ve never seen such a bad developer team to make so many bad decisions and don t care about the feedback of its community there are too many things that make the game really horrible to play they don t know or don t care how to balance perks and killers of this game i don t count how much perks that give killer a wall hack ability on a game that should be a hide and seek which doesn t reward at all the survivor for trying to hide from the killer each new killer they release is even more stupid and strong compare to other killers the system of anti face camp is useless af it doesn t stop like nurse huntress or other killer who can dash teleport speed boost to camp on the hook they nerf the size of the map that the killer can easily found you and camp on the generators i guess they prefer to make only skins to sell and put all the lgbtq charms instead of fixing the game oh yeah this community is also the most toxic i ve ever seen when a killer is doing game hostage camping on the hook focus only one survivor the 4 squad survivors bullying the killer etc league of legend community is better than this one i don t recommend this game except if you like suffering for nothing and when this studio is doing nothing to fix the game and prefer to do what they want instead of listening the feedback
