2018 i ve got over 300 hours on this game would i recommend it yes and nowish there was an eh option instead of yes or no but i ll put no due to the reason i wouldn t recommend it outweighs the reasons i wouldgreat horror concept is a lot of fun and great replayability devs super active and normally they are pretty decent to deal with at least from time to time now here is the reason that i don t recommend itthe community its full of toxic granted i ve met a lot of nice folks through this game but the toxicity of the community in genereal is just unbelievable for every decent person you meet you ll meet about 20 people who should delete the game and go back to f13 where the trolls belong another heartbreaking game to a friday the 13th fan anyhow i ll leave it up to you if you play it or not but if you do keep your calm cause you will meet a bunch of salty and toxic in this game
