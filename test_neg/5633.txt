2018 buys starter edition prior to march 6 only get 4 ops if you buy it after march 6 get 6 ops yet they won t let those who bough it before march 6 get 2 extra op even though its the same game at the same price edit people who had the standard edition prior to march 6 who had to use renown or r6 credits to get the base ops did not get that renown or r6 credit back from after march 6 they only unlocked any base op that they did not already have which is pretty scummy business practices the game itself is enjoyable its just ubisoft likes to money by punishing people who purchase the game prior to march 6 which they only did these chages due the backlase and shove microtransaction in your face everwhere you look
