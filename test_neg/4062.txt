2017 unfortunatly i can t recommend this game not for the subtraction of mod support i never used those anyway not for the microtransactions everything can be unlocked eventually so you don t have to use them they just make it a lot easier but the clear lack of any form of support that take two has shown this game in general whether through customer support or through rockstar s social club you can wait for days afters submitting a ticket for a response of oh we can t do anything you can get banned for being in the same lobby as a cheater single player was abandoned almost instantly i just can t support this game i ve stopped playing it so much in recent months but this has forced me to quit flat out sorry gtav you had promise but your dad took you out in the field and shot you before you could reach your full potential
