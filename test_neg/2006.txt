2023 at times naraka bladepoint is a fun enjoyable game and at other times it s boring and unpleasant to play for example in a match you either go up against bots players who are far less skilled than you are or players who are far more skilled than you are hardly ever fighting someone equally as skilled as you or that was my experience anyways for example in ranked i was plat 1 and i swear i was fighting both silver and empyrean players in the same match and that s not even mentioning that 50 of the players in a match are bots you may find that hard to believe if you ever looked at the active player base for naraka bladepoint but it s true since most of the active player base is on the cn server
