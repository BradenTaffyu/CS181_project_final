2023 noita is a game you should experience its ost is fantastic and you should give it a listen and perhaps even support the artists for their amazing work if you agree it s sold at reasonable price with a recent sale a few weeks before originally writing this on 2023 02 25 at half off making the price even more enticing it has a lot of similarities to metroidvania titles probably mirroring terraria the most but with an incredible sandbox in which you customize your own tools and weapons with the wand system the depth of the sandbox is exaggerated by every pixel being simulated and multiple tools the player can use to modify their world the roguelike has enough variation to provide endless replayability there s even a mod to play the game with co op so you can enjoy it with friends you should absolutely get noita and then mod the crap out of it save scum if you re frustrated the truth is this is a negative review because the review system asks would you recommend this game to other players and the answer is no i would not recommend this game to players i would recommend what noita can become with modifications to it from passionate players but not the noita we re sold it s unpolished with major bugs that directly interfere with the scientific gameplay this game otherwise encourages because of things being inconsistent or justified more by programming logic errors than by intuition or the emergent gameplay mechanics that noita shines because of noita can become a game worth playing so can borderlands 2 both share the attribute of requiring inappropriate amounts of effort from their players for the games to become what they should be already i am part of the group of people that loves borderlands 2 i have over 3000 hours in it i ve played bl3 for over 1500 since then and i ve come to realize that our relationship with bl2 can only be described as a form of stockholm syndrome i would not recommend anyone play bl2 without a save editor as doing so requires a supreme lack of self respect likewise i would not recommend anyone play noita without save scumming or mods noita will have projectiles spawn inside of you when they shouldn t from the other side of walls they aren t meant to be able to pass through from enemies that can t take damage because they re too far away the game thinks that means it doesn t need to process their collision anymore despite that they can still attack just before writing this review i killed the final boss twice in a row within a few seconds while in a fresh run because it came back to life after the portal meant to spawn upon its death had already appeared noita will leave harmful pixels in your path that you can t see blending them perfectly with the background and making little effort to provide an experience where what you see is what you get in those edge cases that are unfortunately all too common noita will have important objects from simple holy mountain statues to rare stones simply clip through terrain into oblivion never to be found again noita will crash and corrupt your save file directly punishing you for investing time into longer runs noita will ask a lot of you then give you very little with the probabilities assigned to important resources designed to yield many poor experiences before another good one comes along noita s idea of difficulty is to have enemies that are either invisible or so veiled by darkness or so far away or some combination of all of those that you can t see them sniping at you from well outside of your range and with enough power to obliterate you before you can react it s these enemies having reflexes that involve the player being shot literally the first frame they can have line of sight after rounding a corner usually because they can skip their telegraph animations at will it s having projectiles clearly meant to go in random directions just happen to always hit you from off screen at higher speeds than they normally travel it s having a single pixel of poly or ice that spawned inside of you and then the wasd spam escape system mysteriously stops working right when you need it most able to ruin everything you ve worked toward or giving you enemies from 4 stages ahead within the first stage or starting you off with a flask of acid a wand that runs out of mana immediately and another that doesn t have enough ammo to dig through all the vines growing everywhere just to spite you it s enemies that spew many of the infamously dangerous pixels when they attack you then bleed exponentially more of them when you shoot back it s having dangerous tanks hidden in piles of snow and electricity based traps guarding loot everywhere even as early as the first stage and that s not about the obvious traps with wires connecting to a power source that s opening a chest near liquid the game is unnecessarily cruel and not in a way that feels difficult but in a way that feels disrespectful and toxic for a game so heavily focused on experimentation experimentation is often punished with strategies that work well eventually no longer working without explanation or change of circumstance it really does not feel like the game is meant to be played as a roguelike and comes across more like the tired old arcade formula designed to eat your quarters major milestones in noita are achieved via concerning means advanced combinations of perks usually involve having an integer overflow or exploiting whatever the hell the perk removal altar is doing the length and value of runs is extremely constricted by the rng including for experienced and resourceful players even before considering that worms may spawn and tear apart important terrain or anger various gods without any consideration of the player s actions for many bosses every interesting mechanic that makes them need to be learned instead of steamrolled by the same build as every other is accompanied a cheap way they can ruin the fight and encourage the player to not bother with them until they can be defeated instantly it s even more of a requirement that bosses be defeated quickly when kiting them involves a real risk of the boss getting bored wandering off into some unfavorable terrain and possibly even becoming impossible to track especially if they re randomly teleported away by an unlucky displacement spell after all of that you ll get a run where an overpowered spell or series of them or reagent is available to you near the start of the run so the rest of the run feels automatic and uninspired the amount of spells perks and reagents to combine lets you experience a delightful curve of power growth with seemingly endless fuel for creativity found in all of the projectile delivery systems payloads and special effects that may provide raw power defense or some other utility i d be surprised if the game wasn t somehow turing complete with computers able to be built in noita out of strange logic gates made out of an awkward arrangement of entities and pixels of terrain and fluids i must reiterate how incredible the soundtrack is and that you should definitely play and experience noita but noita is a video game not an album of music it should be playable and too often it doesn t feel like it is it does however feel like the game s code is a whole kitchen full of spaghetti it s needed an update for 2 years now make the friend boss tanky again
