2022 tldr the key element of real time strategy clear unit cohesion is missing from the game as it is to illustrate the problem let us compare the game to total war rome 2 and how units worked in the game compared to tw iii for example sparta in r2 as a faction was revolved around sturdy and immovable heavy spear infantry backed up with ranged units like slingers and archers your key gameplan was to play like a turtle seek chokepoints and position your troops to maximize their effectiveness your direct counter was anything more mobile than you your infantry would devastate any cavalry dumb enough to charge at them however due to their slowness if you were careless your ranged units would be caught out on the open and destroyed then your spear infantry would be at a disadvantage since they lacked damage output however if you accounted for this well you d still manage to win battles while dishing out tons of ranged damage tying up enemy troops with your own durable heavy infantry in tw iii as a comparison cathay is a faction that is supposed to have strong spear infantry like jade warriors that have charge defense against all cathay has tons of powerful ranged infantry ranging from archers to muskets to cannons now you d expect to hold your line with well positioned rows of spear infantry while trying to watch out for more mobile enemies what you ll find out is that many enemy units just ignore your infantry that is supposed to tie them down for large units like trolls that is to be expected but even medium units like ork boyz run through your spear walls like thin air not around or anything straight through the unit medium charge units like panthers etc do as well when you try to reposition you ll find your units respond to commands late and sluggishly you might find out that your archers have actually stopped firing at targets within their los for over half the battle in the majority of occasions you ll have your entire ranged arsenal wiped out as the first thing in battle either by frontline jank or spells the best alternative is to get the most expensive heroes or generals possible leader units have tons of hp and armor and they deal more damage than most ranged units ever could both in melee and with their abilities they can continue dishing out ranged damage even while being engaged by enemy infantry and can hold their own at least for a while against multiple units even the most expensive artillery pales in comparison to nukes all of the playable factions can call down from the sky if the hero is in range babysitting cannons with a squad of infantry that cant even occupy marauders or any other unit is a waste in comparison since even a second in contact with melee combat breaks your artillery pieces i might be the only one to feel it like so but the best units are large units with firepower unlike their smaller fragile counterparts since antilarge units aren t in many cases durable enough or numerous enough in most armies to take them on even in previous games looking at you tw2 necrofex colossus doomstack if i m wrong please enlighten me so until immortal empires drops i d like more factions in the game that it lacks thus the negative review edit in the recent patch even bullets go through infantry you can fire friendly musket units through your on infantry to hit enemies with no penalty every infantry unit in the game is practically immaterial
