2016 while i have logged quite a few hours into this game i can t say i d tell anyone to buy it aside from the rampant hacking and exploiting ubisoft seems to be unable to fix their server issues with an unusual amount of ping and hit detection being quite sloppy it s a frustrating experience that won t leave you satisfied while many in this community would love to say they found a worthwhile game i honestly have found it to be more frustrating than fulfilling i had high hopes for this rainbow 6 but like many other games by ubisoft it was pushed out before it was ready and it s a barebones experience with numerous glitches and aggrivating problems plagueing an otherwise excellent experience shame i bought into the season pass
