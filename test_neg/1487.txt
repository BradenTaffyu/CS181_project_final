2023 first of all if you enjoy strategy games fantasy games or warhammer or total war titles in general you are almost sure to enjoy this game too you can easily sink hundreds of hours into total war warhammer 3 especially if you buy the right additional content i have in all three games combined around 2000 hours myself however i cannot with good conscience recommend this dumpster fire of a game unless you can find absolutely no other games to enjoy it is unfortunately rotten to its core and i don t see any way for the developers to fix it i sincerely hope future games will do a better job but this one does not deserve your time why you ask well both sides of the gameplay are just so glaringly inadequate first this game is all about capturing settlements with your armies that constitutes 90 of your campaign goals that is how you grow your empire and make more money etc so battles using said armies and for said settlements should probably be the best feature of the game right wrong some of the battles are so bad that even trying to write about them right now makes me furious the variety in battles is amazing but that causes the poorly programmed ai armies to flounder more often than not in field battles the enemy units will try to repeatedly get into new formations neither defending against your incursions nor advancing on you it is somehow less competent in higher battle difficulties once you get the hang of it more often than not you can destroy whole armies of elite troops with only a couple of units of your own as for the battles taking place in settlements i don t think i could do justice to how awful the ai becomes if you don t take my word for it i suggest you watch some gameplay online that demonstrates this debaucle there are plenty of such videos and streams the layout of the settlements also boggles the mind every infantry unit features magically appearing ladders aptly dubbed by the community butt ladders making the walls trivial the design of which are already pretty senseless by themselves inside the settlements you have fixed spots where you can build barricades and towers using some vague resource that you accumulate over time the location of those defenses can be absolutely insane like towers blocked by buildings on all sides rendering them useless the pathfinding would have been considered terrible even in a game 10 years old and the so called victory points oh my god it is just so bad so bad even the simplest tower defense flash game has better design than these battles which are not even supposed to be like tower defense battles they are supposed to reflect real siege battles in a reasonable fashion they just don t these battles were actually so badly received by the community that one update removed most settlement battles and replaced them with field battles the campaign management is also laughably stupid campaign in total war games has never been on par with other major turn based strategy titles like civilization of course because this series also supposed to feature amazing real time battles but in the warhammer series it is dumbed down lower than imaginable though some mechanics introduced in the overpriced paid dlcs are very interesting all the basic features are largely unimaginative and lazy call me crazy but i think such an essential part of a 60 dollar strategy game should be at least halfway decent without having to pay for any additional content diplomacy is mostly a joke only one deal in a hundred that you make requires any strategical thinking it is admittedly better in tww3 than in tww1 and 2 but not because it is now of a higher quality but because you are now forced to waste less time on it thanks to quick diplomacy and auto balance options most of the races from the first and second games either have not had updates to adjust them to the third game or said updates do not function properly it is clear from the lackluster skill lines of older characters missing features in the mechanics incompatible and insufficient adjustments to the new diplomacy options and other interactions between factions etc that no real thought has been put into how these factions should play together in the new game it is like comparing a well made article of clothing to one with weird patches all over it you can clearly see that the patches don t belong which makes the cloting seem very cheap and unattractive not to mention that many of the updates the game receives just do not work there have been dozens of critical issues that the developers claimed to have fixed in a patch which turned out to be blatant lies like five times in a row i refuse to believe that they do any testing before releasing these updates and there remains a buttload of important problems that they are yet to even acknowledge again you will probably have fun in this game despite all these issues and more of course you will likely get bored and fatigued by your campaign by the mid game and either start a new campaign before you get to the good stuff or stop playing for a while that is what happens to most players
