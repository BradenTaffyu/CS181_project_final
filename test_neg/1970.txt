this game will install two trojans on your pc flagged by kaspersky no wonder why steam doesn t pick this up they get patched in during the first game launch they enable full remote access to your pc on startup so i hope you don t do any online banking or online shopping on your gaming machine if you want to get rid of them get st like revouninstaller that let s you edit the registry and disable the startup still not very safe only way to get rid of them is to reinstall windows edit after some more playtime and reinstalling windows i can t recommend this game it is weird to describe but there are so many ups and downs from good to bad feels like an alpha for a mobile port so many hidden menus hidden rewards tons of feature systems and blinking buttons that make your brain go brr not complete and already full of feature creep
