2022 so i ve played a couple hours now and a few thousand of the last two tw w s and other total wars and the settlement battles now just don t make sense to me the towers break any sort of immersion for me and make those battles just seem gamey and completely infuriating to play even though the towers do almost nothing the chaos portals that show up are super annoying and make the game feel more like a moba than a total war game to balance out those complaints the game seems to run great for me low settings on a cheap system and the diplomacy is very much improved over the last tw w over all i m looking forward to the grand campaign as the main campaign here is stupid
