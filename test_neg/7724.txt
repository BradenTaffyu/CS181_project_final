2023 so i put some hours into this game most as a duo some alone some with as a full crew this game is an absolute treat to play with friends if it goes right and nobody decides to ruin it for you or if you are playing with competent friends and decide to ruin it for others did both can confirm it is indeed fun to sink someone after a hard fought battle and also to just chill and do pve for a day that being said the developers are really really stubborn in a bad way they insist that the game is supposed to be this grand adventure where player interaction is king and therefore the pvpve aspect is integral to the experience while the majority of the playerbase which is casual says it isn t there was a pvp mode called arena in the past so all your sweaty pvp needs could be met without ruining some poor dad and sons weekend play session they removed that because the demand was not nearly high enough to warrant the servers instead of drawing the conclusion that that must mean most people simply do not want pvp forced onto them they just removed the mode and forced all the pvpers back in the standard pvpve server so now nobody is happy if you want to just pvp now tough luck if you just want to pve tough luck if you had a tough day this game will not allow you to relax with pve and friends if you want the action loaded pvp this game will not allow that unless you get lucky and find a willing target on the pretty huge map quickly it is in this weird middle ground where really nobody is happy sadly and i am certain this will not change rare has said so so often that they view this as integral and refuse to add pve servers or even just simple level based matchmaking there is an audience for this type of pvpve game but them marketing it as this fun light hearted and make your own story type of game is misleading especially with how winning the battle against your attackers will not even save you entirely they probably had no loot themselves so you got nothing out of this they just respawn with a new ship and try to get to you again as fast as possible while you still have all your hard earned loot to lose i really love most aspects of this game but the fact that it forces it s pvp system where spawn camping is the actual meta strategy to sink enemies onto every player every time you play does sour it too much to recommend you can play for hours and lose all your loot to some dude who you really had no chance against since he had three friends with him who all played 1000 hours and you were playing with just one friend who is a casual player little additions for the interested readers the communitymy god the community i have been called slurs and other things many times either for playing too well of playing too bad people will get sooo angry with you for choosing to run from a fight when you have four hours of loot to lose while the attackers have nothing on board to loot people will get angry for chasing them when you have no loot and want theirs this community can be the nicest chillest people ever if you are lucky most of the time though this game just attracts the people who enjoy ruining your day in any way since that is what the game enables with its design the people who want to have a good time with others simply get pushed out over time by all the toxicity and you can see this shift that is taking place where with every season and expansion there is a bunch of new friendly players who quickly die out after one too many bad sinks the pvp experienceto sink an enemy ship you must board it unless you have double the crew or your oponent has close to no supplies they will always be able to simply repair their damage and bail out the water faster than you can put holes into their ship same goes for you so the actual ship to ship combat is honestly secondary to the on ship boarding combat if you are good enough simply putting a single hole into the enemies ship and spawnkilling them over and over while their ship fills up is the best strategy for a quick sink this means spawnkilling an act reviled in other games is necessary to an extent to win a battle in this one also due to this the pvp is obviously heavily favored towards larger crews since even if they miss most of their shots them just killing you once will mean they can put one hole in your ship and every time you respawn you will now have to kill two or more people at the same time to be able to repair rare is seemingly trying to make this better they disabled ally revives on enemy ships some time ago and you can respawn at multiple different locations on your ship to make it harder for people to completely spawncamp you the core issue still persists obviously they only way i can think off to make the ship to ship combat a more important part of sinking someone is to either decrease how effective the bucket is or to increase the rate at which the ships fill up so you have a better chance to actually overwhelm the enemy crew with so many holes they simply cannot keep up with repairs right now unless you have a similar sized or smaller crew in your broadside for a long time who really just doesn t play well it is impossible to sink with purely naval combat all in all the pvp is heavily unbalanced has a high skill ceiling which is obviously a good thing don t misunderstand and is only really fun when fighting a crew of similar size and skill unless you are some sort of or masochist or sadist instead of these cool cinematic cannon firing naval battles it s just boarding attempt after boarding attempt after boarding attempt with some cannon fire sprinkled in matchmaking and servers for solo duo trio and quad crews specifically would solve they crew size and skill imbalance easily but this will never happen with rare i want to give rare some credit where it is due they are trying to make things better they made it so the solo and duo ship masts specifically is harder to break as said they disabled ally revives on enemy ships to make the spawn camping a little better and i am sure they will continue to do their best still with their current philosophy of swearing by this pvpve very open model this game will never be the adventure many people know it could be oh and hit registration is still a huge issue has been for years so do not count on your shots hitting to actually deal damage in a game where that can mean losing hours of progress
