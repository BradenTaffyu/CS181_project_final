2023 why would you erase history of the game cs go and nuke the entirety of the community hosting fan made custom content in favor of a match making system you re in the wrong industry if you think gambling algorithms belong in video games it was clear the day match makers were implemented but i think people are finally starting to realize just how detrimental algorithms are compared to the more natural meet and frequent system the server browsers of the old days provided you won t convince me that adding support for the community after the launch is any sort of appeasement as it s been made clear the priority here is algorithms generational changes are inevitable but swapping out systems that were proven to generate the success of the industry in the late 90s early 2000s is nothing but tom foolery it isn t a matter of nostalgia it is the destruction of the very same communities that perpetuate the popularity and strength of the game how could a company built by its fan base making mods some of which turned into full fledged titles become so unfathomably blinded by trash technology designed purely to increase engagement based on fomo principles while directly competing with the fans that want to host their own servers forget the ground breaking engine that has mostly just improved visuals on the surface the implementation of this was perhaps one of the worst launches valve has ever pushed out the store front page was merged with cs go making reviews obsolete this update removed access to a plethora of official maps and modes effectively making this upgrade a downgrade achievements were wiped and added nothing new screw the old days i guess the library logo still displays the cs go logo the store front jargon still mentions cs go rubbing the salt in the eyes everything on the workshop was nuked custom maps game modes the community server browser empty af because no launch warning prior support packages was downgraded to a listing displayed through the steam client as opposed to in game get alt tabbed lmfao what happened to the original ct t models making room for more agent models like cod snoop dog and if we look at the oh so futuristic tech behind the match making ranks were reset entirely have fun playing in algorithmic clusterf matches with no balance whatsoever algorithms still can t determine if a player connecting to the server is actually willing to participate with the team or just play solo in their down time after a long day at work ever seen two dogs on either side of a chain link fence algorithms have mastered the replication of this with humans undisclosed tech offering a competitive environment is bound to have mysterious filters and punishments applied ya ll know what blizzard s overwatch mm does as with any algorithm numbers is the game quantity over quality so long are the days valve waits to release until completion
