if the devs actually cared about this game it would be fantastic but there are quite a few issues 1 aim assist is broken controller players can easily hit every shot which significantly reduces the skill gap and brings low elo players higher 2 consistent bugs and lag almost every game i experience lag makes proximity parachuting impossible the other day i was behind someone shooting them and i died in the killcam they were behind me make it make sense 3 ttk is extremely high which makes manoeuvring difficult balancing of weapons is also an issue there is always a broken meta 4 un optimised game i can get 400 fps on other games easily i struggle to push 180 on cod and i play on less than 1080 and scale up everything on low settings 5 anti cheat does not perform weekdays are generally okay but forget about playing this game on weekends filled with people that are hacking and or i get put into lobbies that do not match my skill level overall a really terrible experience yet the foundation is there for something amazing don t get sucked into this game avoid
