2023 it s absolutely impossible to enjoy apex legends the goodhonestly the core gameplay of apex legends has to be one of the best games out right now the weapons the characters the movement mechanics everything is deep and enjoyable if it s all you look at and when they truly feel balanced it really is a great game at it s core but it s potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team the badhorrific match making there is no such thing as casual play i can t understand it what am i even playing i m a dad i play a couple hours a week of video games i just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun not allowed you will play against the sweatiest try hards imaginable every game no breaks it s brutal but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way if you play regular lobbies you play against the top 1 multi thousand kills players you play ranked you still play against those same guys what s the point of either one i just want to play against players around my skill level i don t want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple take from miles away i don t want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs i don t want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and i just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50 50 shot at who gets a down first the game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight the uglythere s so much ugly about this game the toxic player base the hacking the over powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins the overpriced store items the audio the list is endless conclusion stay away some of my favorite streamers and yours play this game and even for them it s a brutal grind but sometimes it s impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun the reality is very far from that those guys play 8 10 hours every day for years to get that good playing this game for the first time or even casually is absolutely impossible a great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions
