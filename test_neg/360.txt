2017 product received for free after playing the game for roughly 500 hours i have come to a point that i should express my opinion about the game s current state counter strike global offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo really you really think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an e sports title well you came to the wrong review comrade in essence cs go in its current state has some things you really wouldn t want in a game of this type cheaters vac most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time but what does valve care the only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted i just can t get over that fact that valve hasn t actually noticed that their anti cheat has flaws but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself griefers they are not really common nowadays but back in the day every 5 10 6 10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn t do anything but insult generally discriminate or just flat out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round these individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks from my experience smurfs i have seen more smurfs in cs go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that cs go just isn t worth playing if you don t know how the saltening begins do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at chernobyl well my friend cs go is the game for you warranty for broken mice keyboards screens headsets desks windows and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included servers when i mean servers i don t intend to talk about the ping lag but instead about how most of the time i get matched against with people from the other side of the damn galaxy this is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members pets in diverse languages while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match tl dr cs go is a game that gives everybody a different experience unless you are playing in russia then it s always b rushed every round cringy jokes aside i think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run despite the initial steep learning curve if valve ever decides to actually update their anti cheat system i will be more than happy to play this game more often cheers james
