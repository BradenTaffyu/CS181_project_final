first game i ever pre purchased do not regret it but this is not a game it s a chore graphics is amazing performance and tuning is outstanding i love the story especially how the studio did not try to modify or add any modern crap maybe it s only me maybe i suck but after 60 h in game with every new boss my feeling is not this again i love all nioh games spend over 1000 h playing nioh on the highest levels every new spell every new skill felt powerful every combo was exact and i felt always in control of all my moves not in this game the negative part is related to game play and design decisions after 55 hours into play i learned that certain combos are not possible with my x box controller setup hat to switch to another setup and relearn everything try to hold y at the same time press x to execute perfect dodge good luck with that miss the full controller configuration capability of dragon dogma 2 overall bad progress balancing after playing for many hours you should get a feeling of being rewarded for all the struggle a feeling of becoming more powerful and stay ahead of most potent enemies not in this game you are always struggling and the rewards feel useless even after fighting for 1 2 hours and killing a difficult boss i don t get satisfaction out of it in the combat your combos only work if your exactly match your actions with those of your enemy if you miss your combo break and you are f cked missing map not linear game play you miss a place on the map you my miss an essential trader of item even if you find all the upgrade items every boss fight is a chore and with out it becomes a nightmare many bosses have one particular hard attack that is very hard to dodge every new try takes you minutes of hard fighting and than you get instantly finished in one strike it sucks many skills you pick from the three have no noticeable effect insufficient balancing overall this game feels like trying to drill a hole in wall using a tooth brush
