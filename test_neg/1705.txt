2023 i ve played warhammer total war for a long long time i ve thoroughly enjoyed it even with some less than ideal lack of bugfixing and some factions really not getting enough unique mechanics to them or older ones getting updates they so sorely needed the only dlc i didn t buy was the chaos dwarves as i geniunely had no interest in them not a dwarf guy sorry i was excited about the upcoming dlc and especially yuan bo after seeing the price increase and the lack of unique abilities could ve done much better for him and the lord of change i decided i wasn t going to pre order for a change then ca came out with this disgusting statement and blames its fans who have supported them blindly for years no enough is enough ca s blatant disregard and disrespect for it s playerbase has gone too far please don t buy anything from them until they get their act together if this is how they go about treating players maybe it s better that creative assembly goes away even if it means missing out on the chance of some good games
