2021 i like this game but and a big but the negatives outperform the positive negatives you know that annoying child usually your relative who keep bothering you and you can t do any thing except waiting for him to return home this game is just like that but this time my friend you paid money to experience that this game have the most toxic community ever survivors 1 experience tunneling what is tunneling the killer keep chasing you and hooking you until you die its like the killer is a bull and you are the red cape slugging the killer leaves you on the floor in the dying state and doesn t hook you face camp the killer stands right in front of you and don t let other survivor help you 2 useless teammates you encounter them a lot even in high ranks there is a lot of types leave the game disconnect when hooked in the beginning of the game waste all the pallets in the map keep walking in the corners of the map does not fix generator or when one generator is remaining if one generator is remaining and you and him the last two alive he will hide until you die so he can escape by hatch killer ok killer can t be that bad right i fear it s worse 1 team if you encounter a team my friend you will experience gang b ng in a new way 2 toxic players complete generator in front of you t bag drop pallet t bag use flashlight t bag find hatch t bag stun you t bag exit gate gang t bag when the match over prepare for the open chat game problems 1 some of the more useful perks you get them from licensed survivors and same thing for the killers andever licensed character from movie or game you have to get them with real money 2 if you want to unlock every character you have to spend 9000 shard to get 9k you have to play for 60h or more and this is for one character you get shard by leveling up 3 the will spend a lot of time in the match making menu in the morning it s hard to find killer games and in night it s hard to find survivors 4 you will end up spending more money on the dlcs than the base game 5 the game hitbox sometimes broken 6 you will encounter random match or game crashes the positive 1 you can play as your favorite character from movie or game 2 the game have cross play 3 the only game alive of it s kind 4 you have a lot of perks you can try different builds for different experiences 5 you can buy it for a very good price with a discount 6 the game are improving with time conclusion if you are irritable this game is not for you either than that i advice you to give it a try it s not that expensive and you can refund it if the game is not for you you have to play lase than 2h to refund i like the game it s a fun but the toxic players ruin the experience for me it s a 7 10 game have fun and don t be toxic
