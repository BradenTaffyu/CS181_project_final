this is mostly a review for mwiii the campaign is short i played on the highest difficulty and completed it in about 5 hours this is the shortest campaign ever the story itself is fine but isn t good enough to compensate or justify the short length seems like just laziness or the devs don t have enough time because they need to meet a hard deadline the open combat missions are mid constantly switching between linear and open combat missions takes away from the story telling open combat doesn t even add much depth to the story they should just stop trying to add more warzone elements to modes that are not warzone if you played dmz from mwii you ll know that mwz is basically dmz cold war s zombies outbreak mode i enjoyed playing dmz a lot they added new content and features to dmz every season given that mwz is basically dmz zombies i expected the same treatment with the content roadmap after all cod is a live service game nowadays at launch the content is pretty packed there were lots of things to do great start but after that it became a content drought apparently treyarch stopped managing mwz to work on cod 2024 every single season so far 1 2 and 3 they drop these rifts which are basically reused assets from dmz it s the same formula where you go into a new rift and do the same contracts to get new schematics every single season the lack of content basically says that mwz is a dead mode given that zombies is not round based here without seasonal content updates there s no reason to play this mode i m a zombies fan so i m super disappointed here definitely got scammed by the zombies mode in my opinion mwz have a lot of potential if they gave it the dmz treatment as for multiplayer if you bought mwii mwiii definitely feels like a 70 dlc it s effectively the same game with some quality of life updates that make things more pleasant like movement updates there are also updates that make things in my opinion less pleasant like ttk is increased lobbies are sweaty like the usual they are doing weekly events every single week for free rewards which is nice for people who don t wanna pay to get items but some of these are way too grindy same issue with the battle pass where it takes 70 hours of game time to finish not everybody has the time to no life this game 24 7 certainly not me also the fact that they spend their resources pumping out cosmetic bundles every single week instead of producing new high quality content especially zombies is annoying we already have to pay for this game is it too much to ask them to not milk us further and focus on more quality content tldr don t waste your money on cod mwiii is my last cod game in the foreseeable future they need to stop this annual release cycle slow down this money machine and focus more on quality and content but like pokemon they re making too much money on the annual releases to break from the cycle any time soon
