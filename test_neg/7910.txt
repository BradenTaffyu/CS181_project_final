2022 i will admit that i haven t played in recent months as of this review which may change sometime down the line but the main reason as to why will be put in the summary i have also played the initial month of my time on the game pass version before getting it here on steam so my time played is a little skewed and to those who are among the side of the playerbase i point out in the review and intend on giving me clowns go ahead and waste your points you ll only be proving my point tl dr it can be fun if you like the whole sea faring aspect more so with friends but expect the toxic as s sweats to slam dunk on you with little to no care on what impact they have on your experience edit on 6 15 2022 i will give this a more proper review once the captaincy update comes out in which i will have put in more time in the game and thus give the review a do over edit on 6 25 2022 if anyone wants an idea of how the playerbase for this game is just look to the comments n edit on 8 4 2022 as i thought the captaincy update did bring new things to the table but at the same time gave the sweats even more reasons to s on everyone that tries to focus on the criteria required for unlocking said stuff no measures put into place to those trying to protect themselves from the kill happy idiots oooh protect yourself oooh it s a pirate game oooh git gud oooh they re after your loot oooh mad cause bad anyone that insists on saying anything along the lines of these take it and shove it the sweats are the reason that i and so many others are wanting pve servers some even willing to put up with harder aspects of it just so that the pvpillagers don t ruin the game experience rare themselves have nurtured this playerbase that has shown time and time again to be out for the kill and not the loot since to them it s a very minor bonus compared to hunting someone down if you plan on getting this game know that you could invest hours into a single voyage or towards a commendation achievement and could lose all of that progress in one fell swoop should some of the idiots swing by to slam dunk on you for s s and giggles combined with how the game has hit registration issues since launch even for melee since all attacks including melee count as a projectile of some sort and thus subject to the mmo esque latency the game has resulting in hits not connecting even with a blunderbuss pressed right against your opponent s face yet them able to hit you when five feet off to the side this is of course without factoring in the vast skill gap between those who have been playing the game since launch compared to those who only started a year couple of seasons ago the core gameplay loop is that you take quests voyages from each of the representatives on the outpost islands there s the gold hoarders the merchant alliance and the order of souls treasure hunting cargo delivery and skeleton bounties respectively these are what players will usually do for gold at the start but each and every island has some bits of treasure scattered about them save for the outpost ones along with the mermaid shrines for those willing to dive to the depths to get them there s also the varying tall tales for those wishing to pursue a set of stories in the game on top of the seasonal content ugh that comes out every three or so months however said loop can easily run itself dry as what comes off as fun and interesting at first can easily be ruined once you encounter other players on their ships rare is going purely by a tools not rules approach to the multiplayer aspect and of all of the encounters i had less than five percent of them were friendly while the rest shot on sight and even pursued to the ends of the earth even if it meant having to sail into the volcanic areas or the red seas themselves the multiplayer aspect is there but as said above you re likely to get a sword in your gut or a bullet in your face for your troubles doubly so if you re playing solo as each and every player is pretty much out for themselves you could have no loot and no supplies on your ship and you ll still be sunk just because the sweats feel having easy kills with rare being dead set on keeping the game as a pvpve one what s worse is that you could be sailing to an outpost after a good few hours in one session sometimes on just a single voyage only to be attacked right as you are offloading and thus have all of your spoils cashed in by the ones that took everything from you this is especially problematic as you ll often be on an island looking for loot only for them to swing by and sink your ship thus leaving you and your potential loot stranded until you warp to where your ship is which is often on the other side of the map compared to where you were previously at tools not rules yes but there s only so much that regular folks especially ones that prefer pve can take before they end up dumping the game due to the sweats that ruin the experience for them
