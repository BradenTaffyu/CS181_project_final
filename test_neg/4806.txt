2023 modern warfare 3 2023 review it really is that bad it s nothing more than just an overpriced dlc campaign takes place in locked off areas of the warzone map multiplayer takes place on reworked modern warfare 2 2009 maps zombie mode is just dmz with 24 other teammates completing warzone missions grinding for perks weapons and pack a punch s just to have the server closed after an hour because a toxic ether storm is spreading i wrote the same review on google and it got censored and taken down just so you know what sort of manipulation this game title goes trought right now it s a horrendous and shameful scam just like battlefield 2042 but even they delivered more content than this 70 dlc
