i want to preface this review that i did absolutely enjoy my playtime with dragon s dogma 2 i even went out of my way after completing the post game to go grind out some of my missing achievements for a full 100 i didn t gather all 220 240 seeker tokens though but its a game i have a lot of gripes and issues with one of the few times i wish steam had a mixed review instead of flat out yes no i adored the first game i had my first playthrough of it back with the dark arisen re release back on the ps3 i still have fond memories of the first time i went out exploring at night getting my ass handed to me by skeletons because of just how unprepared i was and the closest to recapturing that feeling was from fromsoft s soulsborne games the first game was very publicly unfinished the final dungeon was cut and replaced with a single swirling hallway instead of a dungeon taking place on the moon multiple races the landmass etc was all unfinished so coming up on twelve years later and itsuno and his team being able to take another shot at releasing a fully finalized realised take on dragon s dogma is great and i think for the most part they did succeed in that exploration itself feels far more rewarding than the first game i actually wanted to go off the beaten path the map design primarily vermund is downright fantastic i loved filling out my map and finding all these neat little crevices mines caves and minor settlements i spent 50 hours exploring the world before i even bothered touching the main quest after reaching the third proper quest it was enthralling satisfying and i m glad i was able to experience that eventually both from playing the game and looking back on it i do feel a gnawing pain of what the game could ve been and i ll discuss this throughout the review enemy variety in terms of general exploration traversing main roads and following the main quest dragon s dogma 2 has the exact same enemy types as the first game bandits goblins hobgoblins wolves saurians harpies cyclops undead ogres griffins and golems and finally drakes for a game that likely had years of planning a large amount of cut content from the first game to build off of surely they could ve added more entirely unique enemy types i had fun the combat s great as usual with dd itsuno s works devil may cry 3 onwards but i fought these enemies so so many times back in the first game and they re largely unchanged knackers are unique but they re just goblins that hide within bushes or around trees that s kind of about it in terms of bosses ogres cyclops griffin drakes a singular medusa and then the sphinx where did the beholders go the hydras the cockatrice why were they removed it pains me to be fighting largely the same enemies that i have done for so many times sure it s enjoyable but after all this time i wanted more unique enemy types dungeons there s basically none the closest we get appears in the final zone and can be missed if you follow the main quest but again it just uses the basic goblin saurians and cyclops you ve seen for two games in a row and features nothing all that unique or interesting in terms of layout ambushes etc the caves themselves are largely pretty well designed and a good chunk of them can act as shortcuts throughout the world the dungeon i just mentioned lets you bypass a gate barred by the main quest some of them even feature fairly good level design but they all share the exact same look cave within mountain 8920 so aesthetically they re absurdly repetitive what happened to the unique dungeons we got within dd1 everfall both pre post game versions dark arisen s bitter black isle arguably the best part of the game and one of the reasons its so highly regarded now waterfall ruins soulflayer canyon ancient quarry the goblin fortress etc they were very very distinct the main quest i m not even sure what to say for this dogma 1 s main quest whilst it had large flaws and pacing issues at least felt cohesive and built off of itself fairly well plot points made sense and the titular dragon had a large presence throughout the story here though i thought the opening hour or so laid a really solid foundation and an interesting premise a stolen throne a false arisen somehow controlling pawns great stuff sadly that all goes to the wayside within 3 main quests the main quest is incredibly short and feels absurdly unfinished this feels evident as the millisecond you reach battahl you re bordering on the endgame the main quest can be summarised as reach kingdom do a side quest to progress main story sneak into castle four times reach battahl talk to npc kill a drake or two walk to final boss and the whole plot around finding out the false arisen and taking back your kingdom it s just gone after the fourth quest the villains have zero presence within the story even the dragon barely exists for a world which i really like by the way built on a multi dimensional cycle of dragon vs arisen why does the dragon do nothing you get a singular flashback 10 minutes into the game and he s gone until the final boss fight grigori in the first game was a constant threat everything you did was to deal with him why am i wasting time collecting evidence for a false arisen that does nothing to us you see him in a brothel the throne room and then the end why battahl this area just feels like it was added in last second the beastren were a major part of the marketing their empress is even a key part of the boxart banner art on the steam page and yet battahl has a really small map density main quest progression only gives you two main quests total there before moving onto the final boss which takes place in another part of the map and not battahl and in terms of side content you re either constantly barraged by an absurd combat encounter density with 100 goblins or human beastren bandits like 10 caves where a good chunk of them are fairly small and come to a screeching halt with abrupt dead ends no destroy able rocks walls or floors and maybe at max 6 side quests for such a major component of the marketing where s the content why does the quality of the game just radically dip the millisecond you reach battahl it s a crying shame as the zone s designed quite well from a map design and visually its artistically beautiful one of the few times i have loved the look of an arid desert biome in games but from a gameplay standpoint it s not all that fun to explore or go through endgame post game i just flat out don t like it everfall wasn t amazing but i d take another everfall over a weird timed roguelike which goes against the whole preparation and exploration focused main game why should i be rushing around the world constantly with a slight worry over a timer or having all of my progress lost because i died visually its pretty neat and the new paths are decent enough i d just want to explore it at my hearts content and at my own free time instead of dealing with a timer to finish the quests there i won t spoil it much because that d be unfair to do in a review overall the game s a great time but i just can t stop thinking of what could have been there s a survey going around which is nice to see maybe they ll address content concerns issues with free updates and then an eventual dlc dark arisen styled but bigger hopefully i view the game at least vermund as a great remake of the first game but as a sequel it kinda feels pointless and at times a worst game overall i d recommend the game still and i m glad the game does exist i just wish it was better and felt far more cohesive than it currently is also yes the game suffers from performance issues the microtransactions suck but they re the most bog standard mtx capcom has
