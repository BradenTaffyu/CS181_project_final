after 11 years of rampant cheating they decided to add an anti cheat yesterday they picked on that is not compatible with linux unless they literally check a box which they did not do and said they will not do so all linux users including all steam decks now cant play the game just straight up locked out i will be trying to get my money back and you ll never catch me giving rockstar money ever again this is the last straw for me i do not reccoment this game or red dead or gta 6 this company will cheat you out of every cent they can
