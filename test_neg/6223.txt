2022 i have played this game for years on various platforms and never if my years of this game has the hit registration been so god awful when i m survivor the killer s hit will travel farther than my dad did getting the milk the killers swings will cross light years to connect to my player model and oh boy is it even worse on killer i have hit survivors through walls pallets and lockers i have stopped running perks on killer to make the game fair my ping never exceeds 35 so this is not a network issue nor is there packet loss killer has never been easier to play and the opposite for survivor survivor has become a task i would rather fight a silver back gorilla with my fingers in chinese finger traps and a 40 lb weight carrier around my torso in ankle shackles than play survivor sometimes it s a skill issue this can happen from time to time and i m fine with it but most of the time its my team mates not doing gens so i do what any reasonable man would do and play with friends this just leads to annoying face camping killers and with the games poor ranking system you lose mmr if you don t escape you could do gens loop the killer get unhooks and even save the game for nothing if you don t escape there are only so many purple flashlights i can lose before my sanity takes a toll this must be a recent thing but the game has never been in a terrible state and i feel like the devs don t care i love this game dearly but after 6 years you would think the game would be polished also what about cross progression i thought it would have released by now but as of 7 29 22 29 7 22 it is still non existentso basically play this game if you hate yourself
