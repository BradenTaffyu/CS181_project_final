2022 the only good thing about this game is the campaign other then that its not worth 70 another problem is they dont give pc the option to turn off cross play its only xbox and playstaion so were stuck trying to kill console players that have aim assist which is strong in this game btw ive played controller and mouse and keyboard and can tell you first hand aim assist is ridiculous and its even stronger on consoles from what i hear the devs havnt made any plans to make it where pc can turn it off so i dont recommend this game because it ruins the multiplayer
