don t do this to yourself it is not worth it every minute of playtime i have is covered in sweat tears and rage there are so many individual systems that you have to grind separately everyone still playing this game is held by the chains of their own time spent i can t just quit look at all the stuff i already got the best way to quit something is to never begin in the first place combat is really fun though
