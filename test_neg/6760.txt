2016 updated 4 08 2016multiplayer review only note the hours in total are not 100 from multiplayer as campaign and zombies count towards the total hours played and i have friends and family who use my steam account too activision presents call for unbalanced ops 3 minimum edition oh man when activision announced black ops 3 after the last 2 entries to the franchise ghosts advanced warfare i had hoped that we would finally get a cod worth the money and time sadly i believe this is not the case if you are considering buying this game than i cannot recommend this game to you or anyone else i will explain why in detail and remember this review expresses my experiences and my opinions so here we go pros no exo suit and the limited thrusters make you more grounded than advanced warfare the specialists w weapons abilities is an interesting move but more on this in cons interesting melee weapons added more on this in cons customisation of your character specialist is a nice feature hero armor is a cool idea but more on this in cons some cool designed black market call signs and emblems ability to perform gestures at the winners circle decent selection of options in the graphics settings split screen play controller support works well con to this as well the change from 75 points in tdm to 100 points is a very good move imo cons oh boy here we go micro transactions weapon unlocks via blackmarket and just 1 map for zombies is for some reason a full priced game the weapon balancing has been improved upon by altering the kuda and vmp and a handful of the others however people still resort to roughly the same selection of weapons in the game leaving the others to collect in game dust team balancing is still an irritating experience while lately i have encountered this issue a bit less but you can still easily come across a team with really skilled players versus a team with bad or unskilled players boring recycled map designs only 4 13 maps i enjoy playing on 12 without nuk3town and personally i loathe metro with a passion but everyone feels differently on designs the 4 maps are combine evac fringe havoc overpowered specialists the purifier and ripper are still pretty much the dominant choices among the specialists hit markers or hit detection is awful countless times i have shot at a player and either it takes too long to register that i am shooting them or doesn t register the amount of shots i have put into them short amount of players every lobby i run into at least 2 people i have seen before you would think you were playing a beta or something only a single map included in zombies and the rest are only available through the dlc packs i think you get what s wrong here optimisation hasn t changed much the game still has the odd frame drop and stutters randomly i have a gtx 970 installed so that could be why it stutters but still that means this game has a vram leak and i confirmed this in msi afterburner mechanics how many times have you attempted to slide but end up crouching too many now you may think well you need to build up momentum before you can slide normally that would be correct however why do you need sprint momentum to slide with thrusters answer you don t also auto mantle is a terrible idea because it s a slow enough animation to put 10 bullets in your ass they simply could have made it that you double tap the space bar to mantle so that you don t get forced into the animation the blackmarket it takes you a bit to earn 30 crypto keys just to unlock a rare supply drop and that doesn t guarantee you anything good just that you will get a quote rare or better item which can easily be a rare callsign or gesture you don t give two sh ts about controllers with aim assist while i applaud the idea allowing the use of controllers in game i do not appreciate you giving the controller users aim assist in multiplayer i am not sure if this is true but i have heard of a trick where people can remap the controller buttons to their keyboard and mouse through an outside 3rd party program if this is true than shame on you hero armor dark matter is a nice little acknowledgement of achievement but let s be honest they look kind of boring if you want me to do some ridiculous get 2 rapid kills 4 times or get gold on every single unlocked weapon in the game then put some more effort into the looks longevity now with the introduction of contracts you can do challenges that you complete to gain access to a time restricted specialist that basically permits the use of all other specialist abilities or weapons on top of blackmarket unlocks crypto keys cod points the extra 1 000 levels after the prestige master rank it seems whoever decided to allow all this seems to know that cod games are getting worse and want people to stay on their older titles as long as possible to keep people playing them and to keep a flow of income the verdict i m not saying this to bad mouth the game or the franchise but it seems they are building quite an ego and thinking they can make whatever they want and we will buy it because it s labelled call of duty however if you want to play the game regardless of all of the cons then try it out and judge for yourself to all fanboys of the game this is not cod hate it s just objective criticism and some irritating experiences i have had with the game they may develop but we make the game
