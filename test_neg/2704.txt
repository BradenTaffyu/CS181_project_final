2017 i don t recommend this for anyone that wants to deal with an idiot tech support team the main story is great don t get me wrong but gta online hah a joke you can make your way to the top eventually earn everything have the stuff you always dreamed of only to have a hacker join your session change you into a flying guitar then get banned by rockstar for hacking yourself due to some other hacker good job rockstar rockstar tech support just slams a copy paste reply down to your appeal stating that all bans are final even if it isnt even your fault so i would say play the game on a friends system but dont buy it for yourself especially if you want to get banned due to the poor system scanning by rockstar where the innocent get banned and the hackers are the ones that dodge the bullet again thanks rockstar for the horrid tech customer support
