2020 there s plenty of videos out there explaining exactly how this game is on a downward spiral and sadly i have to agree the game was really good for the first few hundred hours but after that not so much they hype up each update but when they release they re usually unplayable or extremely grindy i tried to grind rivens kuva liches and railjack but i just feel like i ve wasted my time and it s not just me look at the global achievement stats as of right now only 1 3 of steam players have actually killed a lich and 1 4 have actually assembled a railjack i could go on but i ll just end it by saying how de was praised in the past for removing a kubrow color slot machine but then ended up adding rivens to the game which cost way way more plat if you intend to buy them they added bullet jumping because they liked how players were coptering and zooming around the map but then they nerfed that too in fact they just kinda just nerf whatever is popular i can pretty much guarantee you that the kuva bramma is going to get nerfed soon and i don t really feel the whole looter shooter aspect to the game either i mean what exactly are you looting resources anyways if you haven t played it already then play it it s fun in the beginning edit rip kuva bramma
