i m really surprised with how poor the optimization is in the game there s no excuse for releasing a game in 2024 and it s almost unplayable i think cyberpunk 2077 had better performance on release and that s saying something also there s no need for micro transactions in a single player game and had that been communicated prior to launch i don t think i would ve pre ordered the game feels like more time and effort could have gone into stability instead of thinking of micro transactions
