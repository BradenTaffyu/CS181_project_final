2021 i honestly love the game i just don t like how they ban you for no reason and take your money and achievements played since the game came out almost 3 5k games played avg 89kdr unlocked 4 heirlooms after spending total of over 300 got banned right after buying battle pass through steam which i linked recently and unlocking bangalore heirloom the highest damage i ever did on my account after all those games was just above 2k in a match my w l ratio in ranked was 3 and pubs 4 6 consistently increasing throughout all my seasons played i worked with support for months and they won t unban me after 3 attempts to get unbanned no reason given tried to support developers and they just take the money and give me the finger this is my first time getting banned for no reason will never spend another dime on this game terrible support terrible way to treat paying customers if i was an actual cheater i wouldn t care about stupid skins and an account that i put blood and sweat in to i don t know if it s related to the steam link or what actually caused the ban because they won t tell me
