2016 probably only gonna focus on the multiplayer for this review campaign is good but not the typical cod campaign but despite this being the best current generation call of duty compared to ghosts and advanced warfare the flaws of the multiplayer detract from a game with lots of potential just like ghosts and advanced warfare while the 3d movement makes this game feel refreshing compared to the old movement the map design doesn t really take advantage of this and are some of the worst maps in a treyarch game despite the game s amazing gameplay while the pc port is really good the balance is really off since treyarch only cares about balancing for the console versions and as a result there is one semi auto sniper that has no recoil fires really fast and kills in less than 3 shots while this may be balanced in the console version on the pc version this gun is really overpowered as you can imagine and treyarch refuses to create a pc specific patch to nerf it as a result this leads to the balance problem every cod has that everyone only uses like the same 3 guns since the other guns are underpowered compared to it while i still love call of duty s multiplayer it is starting to become really hard to recapture the second prime of call of duty modern warfare to modern warfare 2
