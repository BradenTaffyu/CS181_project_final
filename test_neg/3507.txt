2017 after just under a month of gameplay and about 2 weeks worth of online play my account has been randomly suspended for 30 days and online character reset to level 1 with no apparent reason there is no appealing this ban this is absolutely appalling especially for a major dev company i m seriously speechless right now if you are buying this game then wait till it s at least 50 off and only do it for the gta 5 story portion not the online game you can see the endless streams of negative posts all regarding the same thing happening to others the only light at the end of this tunnel is i m glad it happened sooner rather than later and didn t pump years of my life into the game only to have my character reset with the flip of a switch again wait for the 50 plus discount and play it for the story not the online fu rockstar
