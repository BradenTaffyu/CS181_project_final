2021 the game is no longer ours it belongs to the community pushes update upon people that over 80 of the player base did not want ask for and actively spoke out against otzdarva and truetalent have serious debates about the state of the game and what would be the healthiest way for the game to go but behavior goes out of their way to belittle this by saying this is just a party game but then has competitive game modes and ranking systems in the game they have a microtransaction system that you d realistically only find in f2p games meaning you d be buying most of the cosmetics and buying individual characters and stuff but then want you to pay full price for the game and buy each and every little dlc invidually when doing so would net you well over 120 just noting it s over double the price of a normal aaa game just to unlock the full game to play and you wouldn t even get any cosmetics to show for it they have perk bloat issues 90 of the perks and in game things you can get are useless you also are not fully in control of the perks and stuff that you unlock for characters the bloodweb system is extremely dated and needs to be replaced with something that lets you pick and choose the perks you want and to upgrade and unlock those at your own leisure but devs don t care and just want to keep pushing out skins cosmetics microstransaction fodder if you re survivor you have to use certain perks and play styles in order to counter a meta that the killers are basically forced into or they ll lose playing for fun does not exist in public matches everyone is toxic you will be yelled at and told that you re a waste of space among other such things the devs do not care about this also they have awful anti cheat people get around it all the time in any given match you could easily be playing with a hacker who s keeping his hacks on the down low so that he doesn t get reported because reports is the only way that they catch hackers but they will straight up ban you if people decide to get all of their friends to report you for not playing how they like their bans are also non negotiable they do not undo them it s also more money for them if you have to rebuy their game and dlc and start over that s the reason for them having a strict system on it then don t even get me started with their bugs and glitches the game is literally held together by chewing gum and paper clips it feels like the idea of dead by daylight is a good one on paper it s just cursed with a company like behavior running it any other company could likely take this game and turn it into a gem tldr the game is plagued with toxicity has massive balance issues massive glitches the developers have fully shown that they don t care what the community thinks anymore and i can t recommend this game in its current state
