2017 while at first this game was a lot of fun online it quickly dawns on you how much you actually have to grind for money heists were fun the first two times you played them but you need a team of four communicating otherwise it just turns into a i should also note that there has been no added heists since they first came out in april 2015 content wise they ve only really been adding cars and garages all of which cost crazy amounts of ingame cash forcing you to either fork out real life money 100usd gets you 8 million ingame or grind oh these new cars cost you easily over 1 million ingame which leads to hours of mission grinding if you don t want to pay real life bucks don t bother with online uless you enjoy a long grind and of course rockstar s new ban policy which has stirred the hornets nest trust me when i say they don t care about you the player they only care about the money even if you re wrongly banned like i was they refuse to listen i myself have called rockstar support up numerous times but they refuse to help sending tickets online only won t help either it s just an automated response 95 of the time their support is beyond a joke even with proof that you ve done nothing wrong they just tell you your ban cannot be appealed don t bother with trying to contact them it s a waste of time the little i ve played of the singleplayer hasn t captured my attention i pre ordered this game for pc when it was announced and have over 200 hours and then suddenly in october last year permabanned with no way to appeal i should point out that you can get banned for hackers dumping money on your head or them leveling your character to crazy levels tl dr online is a grindfest unless you fork out cash and rockstar support doesn t care about you
