2022 i have about 3000 hours total on my main but can t even be f to log back in that one i would also love to keep the review short and sweet but there s simply too much to say about this game this game is a hidden gem or at least it was nowadays this game is comparable to insert cash grab game here like anything in life you shall start with the good what s good about this game is the depth of anything literarlly anything you ll want to do and accomplish in this game you ll never manage to because there will always be an extra layer of content on top of it even if it s not now there will be soon trust me what s also good about this game is the friendly community to the starters this game is hella hard and grindy but you can easily find willing to help players literarlly everywhere just load into any mission and find a higher rank player than you and ask for help i can guarantee you with 100 certainty that he will help you without any hesitation progression in this game is also kinda easy but only if you are guided on how to do it what s also a very good thing about this game is the variety of things you want to cosplay into a pink furry you can do that you want to become a literal cannon ball you can do that do you want to become a ghost and do stealthy shi you can also do that you can do almost anything you want with the right amount of grind and this is preety much all i can say are the good points for a new player now i have no shame nor hesitation to tell y all what a shell of this game has become just because of some absolutely mindless developers and their way of managing the game just by using spreadsheets and data and not even playing their own god dayumn game 1 nerfs and reworks the game has too many grind levels to the point where you d need to put in some dozens of hours to farm for a specific setup just to optimize the speed of some mission or task this is good because it also implies there some kind of skill gap roof system where you can do anything but some can do it better because they put in more effort but their effort goes straight down the toilet when de decides that this specific weapon or character is too powerful because their excel spreadsheet back in the offices say that 60 of the players use that specific thing only in that specific situation i mean yea that s the whole point of optimization finding the right setup to do things the fastest way and you ing nerf it hello ok fine we will use some other explosive weapon setup or nuke type characters to deal with the situation nope they nerf the amount of ammo of that weapon rendering it borderline useless sure fine get some mods to compensate that nope they will simply nerf the weapon to the ground rinse and ing repeat this has happened to any all time favorite weapons that the playerbase has ever met the exact same process so we get mad right players get mad and we complain seems like they didn t like the change let s add some mods that might change the situation useless mods that do borderline nothing better than their counterpart fine you can argue that for this specific weapon that 20 faster reload speed increases its dps but that s horse you ll never use that weapon seriously unless you just use it for fun or because you like it 2 skins baby skins everywherelately there s a trend with this dev team to release more and more skins that btw in this game don t give you nothing but eye sores or pleasing idk you decide and they also charge mad money for some of them sure that s fine i guess but the problem is that they prefer to add skins with each update instead of fixing bugs optimizing things reworking things or simply add qol stuff nah bro you want to fast travel from here to here here take big booty furry girl khora skin for 40 do you want your favorite weapon to be better or a skin for it nah bro here take big booty ghost girl wisp for 40 they d do anything to get more money out of your pockets and delay content for as long as possible come on man they are a small indie company have you seen their actual office building and their actual size of the development team i can t imagine how much money they make monthly and they hide behind this shiddy reason pathetic 3 content but at what cost ok fine we get a big update big spike in unique players and in online activity because people come and go from this game often we get open worlds we get a spacecraft we get reskins of the same weapons but with some small change in their values which make them so op you can t even wrap your head around it new quests and lore this is the biggest thing honestly then you play it farm for things ungodly amount of grinds btw with specific setup just to be nerfed soon just keep that in mind and one month later a patch comes and there s two possibilities they either make the grind harder and longer or they choose the even worse option to nerf things to the ground so that 60 of the people who were using that specific weapon setup don t do it anymore then you sit there and think about it why did i farm 50 hours for these things just to be nerfed new content gets added grind is over 9000 new maps get added grind new factions grind new pets grind new mech style combat gets added grind new hoverboard gets added grind new space ship gets added grind grind grind grind it s a grindy game and there s nothing wrong with that but to grind something and to be nerfed later so you basically wasted your time is outrageous 4 de doesn t even listen to their playerbase whenever there s something wrong with this game community finds it first so what do you do when you find a bug or something that shouldn t be the way it is you report it to the dev team what do they do nothing lmfao get f cked over the years there were so many issues with the game and de decided to ignore them every single time and add more skins over it hoping we forget and sometimes even worse they nerf things that work good and are actually nice to have but they simply take the candy from the children there was this jetpack called itzal which if modded properly you can literarlly teleport like 20m instantly and you could spam it we used it to move around the open world maps which would ve taken waaay too long to navigate without that so almost everybody was using it what did they do they added a very long delay 3 5 seconds i don t even know what it is hence i stopped using that to it so we stop using it ok sure there was a work around with your operator which can do the same thing but less times that also gets nerfed needless to say that the operator grind takes literal weeks to be able to do what i just said they nerfed it because they looked at the spreadsheets one day at their morning coffee and observed that 80 100 of the people are using that to fast travel so they took it away 5 band aid mods as filler content when all fails and community is mad just add the same mods reskined and with a gimmick extra modifier to it of course add it behind huge layers of grind lmfao what were you expecting these mods are good once you acquire them and grind for them but the grind is simply useless why do i need 4 different types of serration when i can have one that fits all why do we need umbral mods when you can simply make the normal mods better why do we need galvanized mods and don t even get me started on rivens rivens are mods that are simply slot machines but instead of paying to roll the slots with money you pay with your timeto finish it all you simply cannot have something convenient and efficient for de to not nerf it tl dr the game is a grindfest and the devs will nerf your grind anyway because that s what their spreadsheet says instead of fixing things just add more big booty titties warframes and cosmetics that are way overpriced
