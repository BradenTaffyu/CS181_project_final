2023 so i know i ve said i don t recommend this game that s kind of a lie i love this game for what it can be at times i have played for a little over 350 hours which is nothing if you want to be good at the game i think this game is awesome at times and is amazing to play with friends but i can t bring myself to recommend this game rare does not listen to it s community and the game can be very janky hackers have become more frequent by the week and there no third party software detection as i continue to play it i lose more and more of what used to make it fun i recommend this game to people who want to be a pirate for 100 200 hours it is a great game and very pretty however it is a game that is continuing to go in the wrong direction and keeps getting increasingly frustrating to play as rare s servers are pretty bad rare does not listen to it s community and rare continues to ignore the hacking problem and pretend it is not as big of a deal as it is to exemplify how bad the hacking is this is a triple a game the only triple a game i know about besides gta that has speed hacks teleportation hacks aim bot the ability to spawn items flying ships basically all the hacking under the sun rare seems to have no intention of fixing this soon basically fun game nice to play with friends but has a company backing it that seems to really not care update the new season makes the game damn near unplayable
