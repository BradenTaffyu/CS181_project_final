2017 i ve played this game since the beta and i love this game s conceptual design the reason this game only gets 50 000 peak players is because of the ridiculously bad netcode lag compensation and overall frustrating shooting mechanics operation health did nothing i think that was just a pr scam to make pleyers think they fixed the game it s really a shame as this game should have millions at peak but because of the devs total lack of understanding their own game people go away the game has actually gotten worse since launch most people with good connections can t stomach it for very long i play this game less and less and i m a die hard for this concept i keep thinking they will fix the shooting so it s not morons with 300 pings running around with 3 speeds eating 20 bullets and receiving only 5 damage the fact that it s advantageous to have a high ping in this game really says it all about how out of touch the devs are to this game until they realize this and understand how much money and success they could get by fixing these issues it ll remain in this limbo of an almost great game unitl then i can t recommend this game to any new player which kills me inside
