2022 behavior isn t a video game developer they re a video game company whether you buy the game and play for 2 hours or buy it and play for 500 you bought the game once and that s all that matters to them they ll keep you around and confused with absurd balance changes while they slap a new licensed killer into the game for new players to oggle at the game has no anti cheat easy anti cheat is as much of an anti cheat system as a single square of thin gas station toilet paper is toilet paper you know it s there but you don t feel like it is and it s a situation that you re gonna have to wash your hands of eventually the game has no internal checks for cheaters they can do the most obvious that a single if then line of code could detect basic goo goo ga ga baby that a 12 year old with a functioning pair of eyes could see as wrong like survivors flying around the map and clipping through walls pretty sure the game is supposed to depict the slasher genre slightly more than cosmic horror basic things that any games company could implement in a matter of hours like a simple colorblind filter are an impossible task for the developers and don t think you can get a sensible response from them outside of the devs putting their fingers in their ears and shouting until you leave there are so many things in this game that need an update trapper the main icon of the game is ironically one of the weakest and most outdated killers in the roster he s such a product of his time that you d think he was designed without survivor perks in mind wasting so much time just setting up a power that barely provides any payoff unless you re extremely skilled with it newer killers get these fancy kill animations where the older ones just slap the survivor with their blade a few times half of the perks in the game are just plain bad or should get combined a few of them are even a straight detriment to the player i think the worst part for me is just the amount of time it takes to get any decent builds in this game assuming you only want to get to level 40 with each killer in order to get their respective perks you d need about 1 3 million bloodpoints for each killer there are 27 killers in the game that s 35 million bloodpoints just to get every perk unlocked let alone getting all the perks for one killer let s assume you get 26k bloodpoints every game pretty decent and assuming you don t use anything that boosts your gain that s 1350 games that you need to get every perk if each game is 20 minutes long that s 450 hours of nonstop gameplay just to unlock every killer s perk now you re ready to start dumping even more bp into each killer just to get them to prestige 3 and then get them every perk in the game if you want to be able to slap any 4 perks together on whatever killer you feel like playing you ll have to wait until you re so burned out from playing the game that you can tell what color underwear a player is wearing just by watching them play yes i know that players are gonna be running bbq chili and whatever other stuff to boost their bp gain but the amount of time it takes to get to a point where players have the freedom to choose to play with what they want is ridiculous by the time you get to where the game can start being really fun it stops being fun wake up you re in a coma this is the only way we can communicate this to you nothing you see is real it s all in your head please wake up anyway in conclusion the game is dumb and i m not playing it anymore until i do but don t think i ll enjoy it which i will sometimes but most of the time i definitely wont
