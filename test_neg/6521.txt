2020 game is supposed to be asymmetrical giving more power to the killer as opposed to the weaker survivors problem is there is an option to play with friends which allows for teamspeak and coordination among survivors which negates the power level a well organized team cannot be beat this can be seen by the tournaments that are held where they are scored by points and not kills the second isnt as big of a problem because it seems to be the norm in any game but i ll mention it anyway the toxicity in the game is rampant there are so many games where if you run a perk no ed you get harassed for it end game if you don t run it then the survivors coordinated just mock you with teabagging all the way out the exit gates they always wait out the clock too to rub it in there is no option for a casual game when playing survivor many games the killer just camps the hook because he most likely had the toxic vibes previous game had more terrible games than fun ones i d say the ratio is 1 good game for every 5
