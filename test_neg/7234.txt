world and map are cool combat is great and the most epic feeling fantasy combat you ll get from a game unfortunately that world and map and combat lack a reason for being combat in a rpg like this will always be something you do on the way of your journey or adventure and no matter how good the combat is it can t make up for other crucial aspects of an rpg game like story quests loot and dungeons when you see some cool ruins in the distance up on a hill it lights up your imagination to want to explore it but when you get there there s often nothing there but some cookie cutter cellar with a chest with lousy consumables for loot aside from some caves there aren t really any cool dungeons in the game and the story and quests aren t great either and it s anticlimactic to buy your best gear from a merchant instead of finding it out in the field so the otherwise great combat and world basically don t serve any purpose ultimately the game is a big disappointment because it could have been something truly great perhaps it will someday
