1 of the best games i every played but honestly the pricing for the dlc contet most of which should be free makes me kinda hate this company for their insatiable greed and even tho i want and can afford to buy more classes to play i refuse once you finish the campaign you want more and jump into mortal empires but to get any more races to play you gonna have to start to bleed your wallet to get all the races from the previous games the cost is around 180 euro which is on top of the already 60 euro you payed for this game if all the classes from the previous games were included for free or at a heavily reduced price i would be happy to pay for all the new dlc they put out just to support the game but 19euro for the wood elves or 3 5 euro for blood effects for a warhammer game nope
