2017 this was fun for a long time beautiful game you can probably see from my profile that i have a lot of hours logged so i hope it is telling on how much fun i used to have playing this game i pretty much only played online though i heard that the campaign solo was great problem is that it became a game where grinding was more important than enjoying the environment the vehicles story etc most of the new vehicles that are being released by these updates arent available in solo play so online play is the only way to use them you can use them in missions and if you really like them then shell out millions for them if you dont have the time to grind and make money then there is no way you ll get them and even if you do everything costs so much that you ll have to do more grinding to get that next overly priced vehicle rockstar knows this and that some people with money will pay to get these things so they became all about the shark cards for 100 you would receive 8mil in in game cash and it wouldnt be enough to purchase the two most expensive vehicles in the game the bombushka alone is nearly 6mil or 64 98 in real cash the mammoth tula and the molotok are about the same you are paying the price of a whole new game for one plane that you can store in your 1 5 3mil hangar which you barely had money to pay for after buying the dang plane i am uncertain if they made any changes to purchasing military vehicles but last i checked you could not sell them back for some fraction of the original cost so if you decide later that you don t like the vehicle you ve just wasted a lot of time and possibly a lot of real cash i m tired of doing the same missions over and over to get poor returns then spending it all on one thing i just wanted to have fun and not get bored after doing the 20th resupply or cargo theft run for whatever business im operating stop giving rockstar your money and make them do something that isn t all about rockstar bottom line i cannot recommend this game to anyone that doesn t have a lot of time on their handsedit amputator thanks page wouldn t load will try again no i can t recommend it anymore it was tons of fun before but now they arent adding anything new no new concepts each of their last additions are the same spend at least 1mil on a new place get packages which have a timer bewteen runs finally get enough to sell and walk away with maybe another mil after 12 hours of doing the same missions over and over if this were an rpg their additions would actually add a variety of content that lasted more than an hour or two instead i have to do the same bs for hours to get half way to purchasing one item but they know the user base is stupid enough to puchase a shark card and use it to buy a plane worth 65 more than the game was to begin with rhyathymia says the guy who spends too much time playing fo4 that was the worst one by far you really have no idea what a good rpg is to begin with online has no rpg basis that is the solo campaign smh online has no decision making no character development and no narrative other than a half assed conversations with ron the whole plot is making money so you can buy the next expensive car that rockstar inevitably releases that may make you slightly better at doing the same thing you always do like terrorizing other players hell they even have mods and modded servers for rpg style game play
