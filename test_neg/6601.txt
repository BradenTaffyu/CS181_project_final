mildly entertaining to level up so it s not bad for a free game but the end game content isn t doing it for me low drop rates is the only thing to keep players around lots of skill dps checks that will scare casual players away frequently matched with only one player even during peak hours wasting hours on operations to get only coin rolls is akin to torture a few specific weakpoints that are near impossible to hit because they move too quickly looking at you frost walker
