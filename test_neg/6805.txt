2019 zombies is fun but activision doesn t care about your satisfaction i bought the base game and when the zombie deluxe edition went on sale i wanted to buy it so i could complete all the dlc zombie maps but hey if you own the base game you can t buy the cheaper bundle to make it abundantly clear all they want is your money black ops 3 zombie chronicles season pass 50 usd 50 off of normal 100 zombie chronicles by itself 21 usd only 30 off of normal 30 season pass by itself 40 usd freaking 20 off of normal 50 what does this mean if you own the base game it s cheaper to delete blops 3 from your library and buy the bundle than buying zc and season pass individually what a scam
