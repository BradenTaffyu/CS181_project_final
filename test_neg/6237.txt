2017 i dont have enough words to explain my feeling about this game having owned dbd since launch and have played it religiously for about the first year of its release and having stopped playing it a few months ago i have only just decided to write my final opinion on the game i love and hate the game got to the point where it was more of a chore to play it rather than pleasure and i ll tell you why my experience at the game having acheived rank 1 every season rank reset on killer during the time a played this game i have seen what the game is like at all levels of play having gotten my first rank 1 placement less than a month after release initial release when the game first released and having mained the killer since i can honestly say that was the most fun i have every gotten out of a game in a long time chasing down your first survivor was absolutly thrilling hooking them and thenm ultimately sacrificing them back when the game did have the many bugs killers being trapped in walls having them magicly tp out of the map and unable to re enter and it extreamly dumb features inifinutes if i had a chance to play during that time again i would with out hesitation first dlc at this point i was still in love with the game but looking back at it now this was the starting point of a very steep hill that the game is about to go down the nurse most survivor will say the nurse was op and she was during her initial release and i do agree with the reduced amount of blinks what i really want to talk about though is what was to come of the game after survivor perks this was the starting point of the well known debate about survivor perks and how broken they are and yes they are completly broken d strike was the start of it me personaly i didnt have any problem with this perk i thought it was fine giving them a one time only ability to jump of the killer s shoulder i dont know what the devs where thinking but from the point of bill being released and his perks up untill now they have given the survivor so many invunrability dead hard borrowed time insta heals and combo that with the amount of speed boosts sprint burst lithe balanced landing not to forget about the much loved flashlights in the game it makes hooking someone virtualy imposible if you have someone with a flashlight and knows how even if you managed to get though all of the perks they have to offer you still get cucked by someone with a flashlight killer nerfs this was the nail in the coffin for me not only do they release all these broken perks for the survivor they pour salt on the wound by nerfing the majority of the killers such as the increase trap setting time and wider spawn locations for them and not forget the fact that you can no longer place traps and hooked survivor s feet billy got reduduced travel speed during his chainsaw aswell and the extreamly poor hit box with it that is thinner than a peice of of paper the ability to crouch walk over the hag s traps to aviod triggering them aswell as the game breaking killer that was the doctor pre rework who was just all out useless speaking of uselss killers lets remind out selves of the worst killer of them all and the killer i mained the wraith this poor fella has been shown absolutly no love what so ever it took the devs over a year to finaly change him note i am aware of the community poll where the doc was voted to have the next rework and wraith came second not only did u can to work around all the during the chase such as perks and a stupid amount of pallets and pallet looping you had to work with an absolutly useless ability which hindered you in most cases where the slow during the entire animation of his unclocking quite literaly gave the survivor enought reaction time as if a killer had just walked into the killer terror radious current version i still have hope for this game after all this we killers have been given i still have hope and what the devs are doing recently with killer reworks i am happy to say that they are moving in the right direction they finaly have stopped listening to the survivor s only and realise that the killers need some love to the community one of the worst communities i have ever been part of and play league of legends that says something who would when given the chance slaughter each other without hesitation who constatly and whine about the game with every survivor main constantly tea bagging you when ever they put a pallet down in front of you they just have to let the killer know that they are better than them by running to a pallet and putting it down overall i know at the start this held a review format but soon led to a bit of a rant but its beacsue i still have a pasion for the game and i am sad to have to let it go as i stated at the start its become a chore for me to play this game now its nothing to how it was if i was to compile all my experiences and opinions about dbd im afraid i would say i do not recommend dead by daylight
