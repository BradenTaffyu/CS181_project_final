2015 recommend the single player but would not recommend playing online if you re looking for a good online game then you are not in the right place this online experience has alot to offer and a great potential but after that many years rockstar still didnt make it to work normally if you re playing with your friends then you re good to go you will be able to do the heists like a normal person if you don t have friends that own the game this is what you re going to experince playing online heists you will barely be able to do them why because 95 of the players will disconnect while you play because they don t give a about you out of the so many hours i was playing gta online i promise you guys that 75 of the time i was waiting in lobbies for players to connect for leaders to press start or just waiting for the messiah to give me normal people to play with yeah freaking 75 of my time playing this game was in lobbies waiting for something to happen no way you can do the heists challange without good buddies and normal people with brains
