2017 let me preface this just a bit i love counter strike i ve met so many cool people over the years i ve played had so many laughs and good times it s been a blast however i d say about 95 of that was purely through casual so after 500 hours in the game i decided to try and get into the competitive scene i got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks i know call me bad etc and we were having good fun we d win 3 lose 1 but the point was that it was fun however as we got higher and higher up it stopped being fun the reason absolutely piss poor matchmaking and security from valve s end i can understand one bad game or 2 but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible at this point i had stopped queing with less than a full lobby me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots they d leave and then its a 3v5 for the entire match experiences like this are not fun at all the worst part though is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game vac is the poorest excuse for an anti cheat system i ve ever seen one hacker will basically carry an entire team and 9 10 times the enemy team won t have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker because he ll carry them to the next rank the most you can do is report them but with how cheap this game is it s no problem for people to make another account and rinse repeat valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti cheat system it is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a about their community that i can think of in the gaming industry say what you want about ea being a money hungry company that hates their fans i guarantee you that you won t run into as many hackers on official dice battlefield servers than you will an official csgo server that s just sad again i love this game if you want to play casual or community or what have you you ll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game learning the maps and engaging with the goofy ass community i ve come to love hate however the competitive scene is pure cancer i do hope that valve reads these even though i highly doubt it because i truly want what s best for this game tks for reading sen
