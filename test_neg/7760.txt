i ve played sea of thieves for over 2 000 hours i preordered this game for my xbox and was there on day one i ve seen the highs and the lows and unfortunately it s been mostly lows lately my dedication to this game runs deep but after all these hours i can safely say it s not worth your time anymore if you re looking for a pirate adventure steer clear of sea of thieves this game is a disaster overrun by cheaters exploiters toxic players and a development team that seems to have lost its way here s why 1 exploit city this game is no longer about skill it s about who can abuse exploits the most players use the crud launch to swim faster than any ship and leap onto your boat like dolphins or the funny launch to swim across the entire map in no time then there s dpi glitching where players become practically unhittable in water making every encounter a frustrating mess it s not about being a pirate anymore it s about who can break the game first 2 cheaters still running wild even worse some cheaters are still slipping past rare s weak anti cheat teleportation invisibility esp and aimbots were rampant for a long time while they re cracking down on some of this the damage is already done you ll still run into these cheaters frequently enough to ruin your day the anti cheat is almost nonexistent and those who exploit the game seem to be the real winners 3 toxic players and racism the sea of thieves community is as toxic as it gets voice chat is full of racial slurs homophobic comments and just plain nastiness report them all you want nothing changes it s like the devs have given up on moderating their player base leaving decent players to endure a never ending stream of abuse the devs seem to be more concerned with selling cosmetics than addressing the garbage fire that is their community 4 hourglass mode is a total downgrade remember the arena the one mode that actually required skill and was fun for competitive players well it s gone rare replaced it with hourglass and somehow it s worse in every possible way cheaters are everywhere the matchmaking is broken and the mode is far less fun it s a joke compared to what the arena once was and it feels like rare simply gave up on competitive gameplay altogether they ve completely abandoned their core playerbase and now cater to casual players and whales willing to shell out for overpriced cosmetics it feels like the devs have turned their backs on anyone who actually cares about the game s competitive integrity 5 a horrible experience for new players new players beware you re not just jumping into a pirate adventure you re jumping into a feeding frenzy where you re the prey between the glitch abusing veterans actual cheaters and toxic griefers there s virtually no chance for a fair or enjoyable experience the game doesn t explain itself well and you ll spend most of your time getting obliterated while trying to figure out what you re supposed to be doing 6 all about the money instead of addressing the rampant cheating and exploit issues rare s priority is cramming more and more cosmetics into the pirate emporium it s obvious they care more about milking their player base than providing a stable enjoyable gaming experience why fix the broken core gameplay when you can sell a 25 ship skin right final thoughts sea of thieves had the potential to be the best pirate game out there but now it s just a frustrating mess exploits cheaters toxic players and a development team more focused on cash grabs than fixing core problems have dragged this game down to the depths avoid it unless you enjoy pain
