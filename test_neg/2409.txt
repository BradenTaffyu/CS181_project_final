2020 this is probably the best battle royale shooter out there that being said you might be asking yourself why i gave it a bad review the answer is simple this game has the worst servers i have ever seen in any game in my entire life i ve been playing this game for quite some time now since s4 to be exact and accumulated around 350 hours in total counting hours on origin which isn t a small number in this game i ve been playing quite a bit of ranked was diamond and know my ways around the game but i can t recommend this game at its current state the game mechanics are fun and versatile the characters are great and the game has a bunch of good stuff to offer it would be foolish to not recommend this game judging by what i just said but there is one thing that makes this game a at best the servers run at unknown server tick rates some say its 20 tick some say its 16 some even go lower spectator mode probably runs at 4 8 ticks but what are tick rates tick rates are the rates at which the server refreshes the game so to say eg you shoot at your target and track it the hitbox moves with the target with low tickrates the hitbox might be a little behind the target but thats no big deal as long as the following doesn t happen ea is the main company behind apex if you hadn t noticed by the earrape intro pro tip go to properties launch settings and type in dev in there this gets rid of the intro and so you might except stable servers since they already are low tick no the servers don t run good they run like in fact they run so bad that you could eat tacos with spicy mexican salsa and down a rusty pipe filled with bugs and rotting corpses and that would run better than the apex legends servers cs go ran the same engine with 64tick servers the minimum for shooter games imo the difference between cs go and apex is that valves servers run good so what exactly makes the server so damn bad they have insane packet loss 20 80 usually have tethering issues brutal high ping you can lose your connection and even get kicked out of the game entirely making enjoying the game a very difficult task you might say that that doesn t happen often because it just simply can t right it happens almost all the time sure you might have a lucky streak of 3 4 games that aren t ultra laggy but if you find that you might aswell gamble all of your stuff away because you basically just won the lottery to give you a perspective i ve played 10 games today for reference i had 2 good lobbies that didn t lag me out the rest were gruesome and disgusting i ve been kicked out of the game lagged so damn hard i got pulled back multiple times was stuck midair and my shots hit the target but didn t register i have a good internet connection and usually play on 10ms ping they could fix this major issue by simply attending to their servers and increase the tick rates hell even 32 tick would be enough to play this game properly fixing the server to be stable not cut the connections of players not have insane packet loss or latency would also make this game insanely enjoyable even at 16 tick another big issue i ran in is optimization my current rig isn t the best used to play on a i5 4460k 1050ti currently running the same gpu but with a r5 3600xt going to upgrade to a 5700xt on the gpu soon tho anyhow the game has it struggles to keep 60 fps even at the lowest settings on 1080p even worse performance on the latest map olympus especially on longer sightlines and larger locations tl drall in all apex legends qualifies as the best battle royale but the server performance is the main problem hindering it from being the best the servers are just way too bad to be even considered using as servers for a game thats not low demanding like vanilla mc servers
