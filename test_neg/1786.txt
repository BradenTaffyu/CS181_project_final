2023 terrible price gouging for the first time in this series history there are dlc i have zero interesting in getting unless it s on a 90 sale edit wow not only is the upcoming dlc barely any content for a 150 price increase but the free patch alongside it is going to remove all the interesting things for the base game factions as well i was looking forward to warhammer the old world and considering buying a cathay army book just for the lore but wow ca just sucked everything interesting about their faction out and left us with a husk to make their powercreep dlc look better patched maybe twice a year with the patches missing most bugs and actively making the game worse and then trying to sell overpriced nonsense on top yea no stay away from this series
