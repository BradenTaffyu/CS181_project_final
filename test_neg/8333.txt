2020 if i could give this game a neutral rating i would on a technical level this game is a masterpiece it s just like those 2d physics demos i played as a kid scaled up to an actual game and watching it in motion is something anyone will find enjoyable my initial experience with the game was very positive the systems looked deep and interesting and exploring was very fun i died a lot but that seemed fair since i didn t know to be cautious yet and starting a new game was very addictive 70 hours later i am starting to really regret putting so much time into this game the problem itself isn t that the game is difficult nor that some deaths are unfair the problem is how your enjoyment of the game is extremely dependent on rng once you understand the flow of the game very few runs are any fun at all because of how rare it is to find decent wands spells i will have runs go two ways 95 of the time i end up with a sub par wand that can t carry me further than the first few floors and i die a slow death while cautiously trying to find another and 5 of the time i end up with an op godwand that completely breaks the game this is mainly because very few spells are actually useful the spell system looks very interesting on the surface but once you ve played for a bit you ll realize how few interesting spell combinations there are most useful builds are either projectile with extreme rate of fire need to find a good wand or op spell finding lightning bolt early guarantees you can make it through most of the game on a similar note the perk system looks interesting and deep but there are way too many useless or outright bad perks that dilute the pool of available upgrades and seem to only exist to trick new players it feels like the developers wanted to make sure there was a ton of stuff in the game without considering much if that stuff actually added or detracted from the experience there are basically two ways to play the game you either take it extremely slow to be safe and explore this is how i would play initially which increases the chances of finding stuff but also increases the risk that you ll have wasted lots of time on a dead run or you rush past everything to the first area of the game where there is guaranteed to be decent wands i leaned more towards this approach as i grew more frustrated with the game anything in between will get you killed all of this wouldn t be such a problem if the early game was at least enjoyable but it quickly becomes a tedious slog because of how little variation there is in how the levels play out and a feeling of well i guess this run won t be fun either sets in very quickly unless you can find a good wand i don t know about you but i feel like if your game is only fun if a 20 sided dice lands on a 1 something is wrong it is very telling that many of the most popular mods reduce the amount of randomness and add quality of life changes such as hp pickups longer lasting gold and reworked perk mechanics i don t think the game needs to be easier but it needs to be more consistent i really really wanted to love this game but i feel like for how much time i ve put into it i haven t gotten a lot back
