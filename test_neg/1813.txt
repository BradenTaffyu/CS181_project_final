2023 as someone who has played the total war series and was introduced to it through warhammer 1 it saddens me to see the complete and utter disarray going on with it climactic entry i ve never willingly written a review with the intention to review bomb a title into oblivion as quite often people will do it just because of x y or z reason however on this occasion i feel justified in adding my voice to the choir of fans who are tired of simply being used as ca s bottom line to feed their short term monetary gain while being drip fed a patch every several months which tend to break more things than they fix they say we are listened to but there is no back an forth content creators have told them repeatedly about things in the past that the community will end up not liking they ignore them and push on anyway they trim down dlc to the bare minimum while increasing the price of it with the excuse of everything has went up in price if you don t buy it we will kill support for the game good luck getting people to purchase your future tw titles with that attitude greedy business practises and shareholders have turned the games industry into a money making racket while both developers to an extent and consumers suffer for their greed keep the consumer happy and your bank accounts and games will flourish how many times does this lesson need to be repeated to publishers and studios it is not my ambition or want to see the tw series or ca close shop people are employed by them and are trying to make a living however i cannot in good conscience recommend this game or its dlc content at the current moment in time due to shady greedy and outright laughably insulting business practises
