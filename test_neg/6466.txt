2017 i love dead by daylight it s definitely my favorite steam game at the moment however i can not recommend it as of right now like most reviews cover the developers of this game just don t seem to care they re more concerned with creating exclusive streamer dlc than fixing bugs which have been in the game for months it honestly baffles me that they aren t addressing and taking care of the problems which are present when i read patch notes from other games they are always patching bugs and more often than not they are simple ones that i ve never even seen or knew were in the game i feel like they don t actually play their own game either or are just biased because they change things that need to be left alone all the time and are ignorant to the unbalanced mechanics in the game like i said before i love this game it s the first of its kind but the developers just aren t watering and nurturing it it s like they just created it and are doing nothing to keep it alive and make it better until they get their asses in gear and start showing that they give a damn k cannot recommend this game
