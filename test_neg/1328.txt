2022 i m sorry for leaving a negative review but i feel like this game is going to be the first step in a long downward spiralling road for fromsoft people are playing this up as a masterpiece of fromsoft s when the issues are even more glaring than when people were screeching about ds2 s faults i don t want this to become the gold standard for fromsoft pun intended my complaints have nothing to do with the open world and though i wish there were less carbon copy bosses i think it was fine to reuse them a little every now and then to fill out the sheer size of the place constant boss duos was miserable though please stop doing that godskin duo magma wyrm and the falling star beast particularly were just awful bosses that i loathe to even remember nigh undodgeable shockwaves that every large enemy constantly spams also really doesn t help long combos punctuated by the boss delaying for 13 college semesters allowing you to write a dissertation and graduate summa laude with a doctorate s in patience before he decides to hit you for all your hp 3 times over in the span of a millisecond with fromsoft s patented funny tracking tm also leaves a bad taste in my mouth the health and damage scaling in this game is unlivable everyone is doing the same 4 cookie cutter meta builds just to survive the game let alone do pvp there is no room for build variety in this game even with so many gosh darn weapons and armor options i had to ditch the mace partway through for the sword of night and flame because ordinary mundane weapons just don t survive into the late game except for maybe the same greatswords that have been equally busted ever since ds1 even with all the weapon upgrades ordinary one handers just fall off in damage and the way bosses execute combos with blinding speed or with stupidly long delays making windows to attack tiny it s just not worth having a faster swinging one hander instead of a hard hitting two hander i am sick of being buried as a sword and board build in every game on top of that dying in one hit to one attack in a boss combo if you aren t actively dumping a third of your total levels in an ng into vigor is unacceptable if there is a previous game that had this issue then correct me but i have never seen it be so bad in a fromsoft game before especially with how this game packages bosses in a way that they fight like bosses from sekiro while giving you dark souls iii movement and controls it is a recipe for disaster i have never before now had the issue in a fromsoft game where when i kill a boss i think thank god that s over instead of that was a cool fight with neat atmosphere of course there a few black sheep bosses in every fromsoft game but i have felt that consistently with every boss after godrick i personally liked his fight it is a chore to fight bosses especially when their health gets insurmountably high and one single mistake in a fight with them means instant death people saying to upgrade summons kinda proves my point because the game is so unreasonable in terms of boss health and damage unforgiving combos punishing you for punishing enemies and etc that you are forced to play a very specific way if you want to reasonably win i don t like games that have only one way to be played especially when one of their biggest consistent selling points is offering you a wide range of customization options also for god s sake please add a left handed option ds2 allowed me to beat the game left handed and it drives me insane that a game touts customization but then refuses to have an option for people who make up 15 of the freaking population that s gotta be enough to warrant a left hand option if devs caved to the pressure of the 2 whole people banshee wailing about replacing gender with body type i ve got a lot of time in all of the fromsoft games ds 1 3 sekiro i ve even cleared all the king s field games except for the first one with a buddy i wanted to love this game it looked like a great co op adventure and i was willing to overlook the design decisions inspired by george r r martin the kinds of stories he writes just don t fit with fromsoft s history of design in my opinion george writes too much about sex and political intrigue and the lore with mohgwyn and the lover s spat between radagon and whats her face just didn t feel like it belonged in my opinion but this game just really made me sad i was repping this game all the way up to release all in all bok the seamster was my one refuge in this game i truly loved his character he was delightful that s it for my review
