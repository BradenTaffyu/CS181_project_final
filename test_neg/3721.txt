2021 the single player is good but not the best that has come from rockstar and it s not being updated anymore as far as i know gta online is what rockstar cares about and for a good reason they have made this game impossible to play alone while making any good progress and have also increased the grind level to match that of some mmos in a game that clearly doesn t support that style of gameplay currently if you want to play gta online you either have to find a group and spend hundreds of hours mindlessly farming and grinding the same missions dozens upon dozens of time or buy shark cards which is what the game is designed to soft force you into doing of course there is another way and it makes the game way more enjoyable
