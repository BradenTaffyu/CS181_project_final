2016 while single player is masterfully tailored for an immersive and entertaining experience albeit somewhat brief i find myself unable to give the game a thumbs up unfortunately cons outweigh pros generally speaking loading times in gta online are outrageous i find myself spending far more time staring at loading screens than actually playing the game sadly this isn t an overstatement you will actually spend more time twiddling your thumbs in lobbies and in front of loading screens waiting for sessions to find players and maps to load you ll also be frequently confronted by cheaters i have witnessed players using godmode spawning all weapons giving me all weapons shooting money at me spawning mountain lions on top of me spawning tanks everywhere spawning police with rocket launchers monkeys and pigs driving cars ufo s rammed into the road a mannequin prop positioned on top of my head etc etc simply allow your imagination to go rampant don t even get me started on heists you ll find trolls people bailing mid game commiting suicide blowing up objectives etc this simply leads to frustration and needless to say a never ending chain of lobby load screens which will inevitably lead you to give this game the finger at least as far as online goes if you don t hate yourself just stick to story mode and try to appreciate the steps tecnology has taken within the gaming world you might think a downvote isn t warranted in this case well frankly i don t care what you think with the money the have they could and had to have done better
