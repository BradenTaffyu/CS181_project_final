2016 gta v is a great game a real achievement for the gaming industry one of those games that deserves to be recorded saved and displayed on a museum for all humanity this is definitely the best version of the game best graphics fps option mods and etc but and this is a big but the new anti cheating mechanism which was long overdue since cheating is rampant is now generating a lot of false positives that is players that don t cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason no one is really certain on what triggers this ban some say discord xplit obs and even windows 10 recording might be the culprit as if that was not enough the worst part is the response from rockstar after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest like dont even try no one is ever going to read your claim this is completely ridiculous and a shame and probably an unethical consumer stance the game is really amazing and gta online is getting better content every month unfortunately the customer service and the anti cheating is a big stain on rockstar s track record if you buy this game now you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue and not being able to play it online i would avoid it for the time being
