2015 i don t think anyone here can agree with the way rockstar pushes their limits with the way they handled this sale they bring out their game on pc after years of it being released on consoles and raise the price of it right before the well known steam summer sale so that the price remains the same with 25 off they justify this by giving you some free in game money which you run out of within an hour of normal gameplay as it s really not all that much on top of all this the extra in game money makes it so you can not refund the game this can t be acceptable by anyone s standards no matter how much of a rockstar fan you are valve is being too lenient with this kind of behavior and should ve frankly given rockstar a slap on the wrist if not a knife for scamming customers like this
