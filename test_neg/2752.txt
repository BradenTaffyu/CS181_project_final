2017 i hate to have to give this game a negative i really do flat out makes me tired of it having to do so it s a fun game great map wonderful level of detail amazing amount of things to do the single player story is awesome and if you plan on buying it for the single player i would recommend it played it during the ps3 era and really enjoyed it even online at the time it was fun but on to headache of why i have to give this a negative shark cards paying real money to get yourself in game currency i think it s trashed this game significantly i get it yea rockstar you somehow need to make money to keep this game active and for the free dlc you ve been providing thats available for all players first off the price of these shark cards and how much you get out of them 100 for 8 million come on really that buys you 2 3 top tier vehicles tops because you have everything inflated in the market making it practically a grind nightmare hell the megalagon gets you halfway to a yacht that s priced at 16 million literally 200 worth of shark cards for a single yacht that you can t even drive around from what i hear the things practically pointless and all you can do on it is change your clothes and sleep like if rockstar did this the standard way and sold their dlc it would literally be priced at a couple or even several hundred dollars in their world or hell 200 for a single thing that serves you literally no purpose and i m scared to even look up how amount of in game currency i have to even get in order to buy every vehicle that s released in these dlc s literally a massive grind nightmare which leads to my 2nd point on shark cards like lets say i magically have the money to afford and waste on a couple thousand dollars worth of shark cards rockstars wet dream than what as a 90 s gamer what in the hell is the point of doing anything like player missions heists cargo missions etc if i already have everything provided cause i paid real cash for it maybe have fun doing them all once with really nice stuff but that isn t really all that long to do and you have absolutely nothing to strive for in game cause you already have everything thirdly rockstar will do anything to this game and at all cost to get you to buy a shark card raise prices of new vehicles and really just about everything they add lower payouts on missions not to mention long cool off times so you re not making so much so fast increase costs of practically everything and make sure that it remains high for you and i ll continue on that and why i mentioned it their whole world revolves on whatever it takes to getting you to buy a friggin shark card it just sucks frankly now on to the ceo work ugh this system that they have going on here just doesn t work nobody in their right mind is going to be your associate or bodyguard with these payouts nobody maybe if you can trick a scrub into working for you a bit before they realize they can make more money doing their own thing seriously it isn t worth it there s absolutely no incentive for people to work for you but against you now that s when a bigger grind nightmare happens because every player in session is bound to screw you up like special cargo for example all it takes is one player in a fancy hydra and its over you ve lost tens if not hundreds of thousands on all this cargo that didn t make you jack in the end which leads to people especially us pc gamers to resource monitor the hell out of a full public session and play it absolutely alone and that sucks too to fill a 111 crate warehouse would take you days worth of gameplay if done alone and hell a week s worth doing one crate at a time to give you the better profit margin like what is this rockstar a job its supposed to be a game not everybody has that amount of free time like i do sadly but if you have 20 to spend on a shark card it will give you close to the amount you d make and that gives you really nothing that s going to help you grind vehicle cargo literally blows me away never have i felt so ripped off in a video game making on average 75k profit selling a supercar that markets for close to 3 million i m sorry what and what you have to go through to source a car with npc s left right and helicopters shooting and crashing into you to make sure the repair costs rack up you ll have a similar story doing vip work i find it so dumb that the only thing worth doing in all that is cocaine and that accounts for a small margin of what else you can do and their payouts literally are not worth the cost so thankfully i saw right through those shark cards and never bought one infact i m proud i never gave rockstar that satisfaction for the sake of gta6 and the future of gta online i have to give this a negative review this turn the gaming industry has taken the past few years is just depressing it s definitely not what it used to be but hell rockstar may never read this or even consider a thing if they did cause it s all about profit and statistics now guess i ve made my point
