2023 i ve been playing total war games for over twenty years and not much has changed setting sure some hero mechanics here and there fine make me make an account so i can be tracked but you give me some free dlcs fine too but when you charge me for a game and half the units in the default factions are locked behind a dlc yet also allow the ai to beat my ass with those same op dlc units i draw the line this isn t a game its an invitation to join a software subscription service avoid in addition the balance in this game is absolutely horrible some factions are incredibly easy and must be played on impossible difficulty for any sort of challenge to be had and others cannot ever be won even on easy difficulty as with all tw warhammer games it requires mods to function both for game balance and because of game breaking bugs for a huge aaa game this game is absolute garbage
