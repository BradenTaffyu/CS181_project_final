it s just a trash game in general the concept is great and there s nothing like it on the market but it ain t that fun pve content is boring and they refuse to add new variety it s riddled with bugs and the anticheat doesn t exist pvp is where the game shines but the servers can t handle anything the lag on bigger ships makes fighting a teleport sesh especially if you have a ton of loot if the lag wasn t enough sometimes hits and healing doesn t register despite all of the afore mentioned problems i would still give it a positive review if nothing else for the sole fact of being very unique the atmosphere and the handling of the ship feels great but boy oh boy the customer support is a joke you can be banned for simply being better than someone having a similar name to a cheaters or hell you can be punished for standing in the way of the ban hammers blind fire they are petty insecure and downright malicious sometimes that s it don t buy it you are never safe from the wrath of the customer support thanks for reading
