2014 this may be tldr but do not worry i am going to break it dowin in to category nicley note that there are good and bad things about pretty much every categorygameplayfor the most part the gameplay is smooth and very resoponcive as the player is given access to three weapons to take in to battle a primary weapon a pistol and a sword or duel swords the shooting mechanics are a bit ordinary hold right click to zoom in all that jazz as the sword play at first is just as ordinary with sword play advances further with combos and such like things as one furthers themselves in the game note that there is only one combo unlock per stance so it does not progress that much although a well balanced sword can out damage most weapons in game with that aside this game will take you to a lot of different planets known and unknown alike on these planets every single mission is basically on one giant map cut in to different sections as some are reused or a player is simply spawned on the oposit side thn they were before so needless to say one planet means one look that you will get tired of really fast some on top of that are built in facilitys that make the dungeouns very constrictive so do not have your hopes up for a visually pleasing level design not to mention that most maps have a horrible layout that makes it impossible to take advantage of the jumping mechanics in this game such as wall running except for in particular portions where it is needed to cross a map it makes the mechanic feel like a gimmic and it plays as one as well the jump mechanics for the most part are terrible one of the most difficult challenges in the game is jumping from one platform to a higher platform because half the time the character will run up a wall and do a back flip leaving you further away from an objective or if one is taking fire from an enemy and wishes to dispatch him it takes at least 2 seconds to get up that small ledge as proper enemies can take away a large portion of health shield given that opertunity craftingnow this is the insentive to keep you going every single weapon in this game can be crafted as well as warframes for the most part it is enjoyable to grind through missions in hopes to get that last rare matterial needed for an item that will finally progress a character the down side is if you are planning on playing for free be prepared to wait a lot there is a wait period for every item crafted which would not be too bad except the least one has to wait is 10 hours most weapons take at least a full 24 hours and warframes take a whole 3 days they claim this game is not pay to win but they sure as hell put a lot of insentive on paying players geting what they want faster for example free player grinds for blueprints fights boss three times in hopes of getting all blueprints for warframe 2 hours max grinds for all crafing matterials as well as cash 5 hours at least begins crafting warframe pieces all at once 12 hours warframe pieces are done begin final blueprint craft for warframe not like they could just let you put them together right thn and there after all those hours 3 day wait period that is the free to play model right there coopnow this game is hard to play alone but it does start you off with 12 revives and rewards players with 4 revives daily so thats a nice litte feature to keep ya going coop is a must in this game and it is 50 50 the community is good and willing to help out with a lot of nice people but more often thn not if one runs with random players they are going to have a bad time there are not that many new players in this game beyond the existing community so a majority of people one will find themselves teaming up with are vets with awesome gear and way op weapons which will drain the experiance from this game drastically as one runs missions trying to hunt for matterials to build a warframe these players will treat every mission as a race and dash to the finish line leaving you in the dust if you explore and look for loot you will not get any kills simply stumble across the map seeing an endless amount of dead bodies left behind every time this type of gameplay does not reward you with anything if one feels the need to explore and actually look around it is best to play with a friend or go in alone but if you do not care and let them race themselves to a red light that is fine go ahead and explore just beware once they get to that red light a countdown eventually begins that will take you away from exploring and eject you from the mission on top of that every other mission has a side objective with a nice cash bonus prize usually in the form of kills get 3 kills in 10 seconds get 5 kills while sliding get 30 kills with rifle things of that nature i enjoy this idea but with random racers joining in every other match they hog kills and assume you are not trying to complete that objective nor will they ask you the so called cooperation turns in to a competitive challenge which one can say goodbye to all crafting hunts and focus on beating this random player to the kills it can be entertaining but it forces one to play at a different pace and a different playstyle thn they may be used to and happening to often that it just does not seem worth it pay to win in the grand scheme it is a little pay to win that is for sure they claim that there are items that one cannot buy but must find through drops in the world i have yet to have come across any such thing i would not say that this game is pay to win but more like an over aptitude to push payment as the best option to play if there is something in the game you get they will have an option to pay pay to get rid of wait time on crafting materials pay to bypass crafting and get the item you want now pay for more revives hell pay for rare crafting items as well pay to unlock my color options for color pallet pay to get a new warframe now without wait there is just too much micro transactions that it constantly punishes player for not paying every little feature one can buy plus the prices oh my god the prices are horrible the lower end things cost around 5 dollars but warframes and weapons are expensive as they have warframes going for over 20 dollarsand you bet ya that those warframes are damn near impossible to get in game through drops this is what you are dealing with while going in to this game i for one like this game a lot it is creative and fun but destiny is right around the corner and is this x10 with no micro transactions this is a good game but way too many cons and way too many things they want you to spend money on i am sorry bot i will not recommend this game for the reasons listed
