2016 tldr game with full potential 7 5 10 game with community on most days 3 10what is cs go it is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000 or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in cs go no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons no sprinting no leaning around corners no weapon bashing rng plays somewhat a role while firing that is how i explain how i have not killed some people at point blank range but i have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples general directions what is good about it i like the basic idea short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win one team needs to secure an objective most commonly plant and detonate a bomb in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal you need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded this is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with co operative people a thing you may not enjoy are this game s microtransactions in the form of weapon skins and operation passes temporary access to maps and more skins be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning nice skins just a tip on what to expect from the community more follows 2020 update this game s microtransactions should have been its first major red flag to steer clear of it what is critically bad about it valve do not appear to care about the state of the game not the least about the community or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues in the many years i have owned the game little has changed except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise nerfed a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point valve thought it was a great idea to add a fully unbalanced revolver that behaves like a one handed one shot kill sniper rifle except easier to handle also even in competitive matches i see players with high ping who lag matchmaking in general seems to be off in my own unranked matches i have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience more drastically instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new xp ranks and a system of cooldowns so during your first dozens of hours of playing you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature a bit peculiar how that works a better solution this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff i e ban the riff raff even if they re 99 of the player base i have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with co operative players however these players are becoming increasingly harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely when i start insurgency arma or verdun i expect to find well behaved and polite people in each session queuing for a match in cs go by contrast feels like playing russian roulette playing cs go on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players a match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and or reporting b lol valve don t care b these people in the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories a cheater using easily available and applicable hacks a smurf intentionally playing on a lower level than his actual skill group and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves a deranker or group of derankers who intentionally make their team lose the match with or without the full agreement of the team and finally a troll griefer or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped only once have i seen someone who i d reported get a vac ban these cheaters and derankers organise themselves in steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these in general policing the community is nowhere on valve s task list according to my experiences this poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters smurfs and griefing team mates hence being stuck in the lower ranks or silver hell before i summarise this review a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community all experienced over the course of one week on a daily basis players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives and curses in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language after a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to commit various sorts of rape upon your female family members and so on also randomly vote kicked by these bigoted groups even if one is the best player of the team me very nice people speak english please them rude refusal followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds two people claimed to be smurfs they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills tried to get team killed obstructed team members initiated random vote kicks demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling from a certain bunch mother mary is a pig isis attack brussels haha armenian genocide is big lie suck a my brown male organ a twitch streamer with a vac ban on a three months old acount upon learning i had two friends with me who were new to the game gtfo they re feces noob noob izi noob noob number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing one to state the blunt truth if you get stereotypical russian or other eastern euro gopniks intolerant middle easterners of whatever persuasion crass chavs others more rarely as well especially when adolescents teens or even younger virtually every match you re f cked 9 10 times i became interested in cs go by watching youtubers like anderzel however now i feel a bit cheated and i realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems in conclusion the game itself in theory is easily worth 7 10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as i want to keep playing in practice this score gets cut in half or worse be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world revealing the true meaning of the game s name global ly offensive some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game this game only shines if you play with trustworthy people if you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along decide for yourself if you want to play something else go cycling have dinner dates play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming pre teens who do not wish to cooperate 2020 minor content and layout revision
