2022 i really really wanted to love that game got hundreds of hours in ds 1 2 3 and pre ordered 2 copies of er dark souls open world sounded like a dream come true the biggest initial problem with elden ring is indeed the lack of adaptation of the souls formula to the open world concept this is essentially dark souls 3 with huge open spaces fromsoft decided to apply its same old dying hostile world concept and the result is you soon realize this open world is nothing but stretched out dark souls levels with random mobs scattered around once the illusion is broken it s impossible to unsee it and you spend the remaining 3 4th of the game experiencing the open world as mostly a dash and run chore on your horse actual dungeons worthy of fromsoft s legacy confirm that game development companies cannot reinvent themselves at will stormveil and leyndell royal capital are where the game truly shines at last fromsoft gets to display what they re actually great at intricate inter connecting challenging level design the problem is you have dozens of hours of frantic horse riding and petty dungeons in between those by the time you reach haligtree and farum azula it s way too late in the game especially after experiencing the lackluster endgame regions the time spent on those should have been spent on fleshing out the first 2 3rds of the game i m not even sure what to say about the post capital areas except it s obvious reviews would be really different if they were the starting ones they are simply rushed and unfinished endgame in general makes you realize how rushed the game actually was and how it needed a year minimum to be somewhat close to what it aimed to achieve recycling of content is one of the banes of this game you ll have pretty much met everything you will ever fight til the end before you reach mid game bosses included except for a few exceptions this is another huge stepdown for fromsoft and another clear indication the game needed more development time it doesn t just stand for enemies either you will inevitably encounter the same graves and catacombs churches shacks and ruin models over and over again this harms the entire premise of a believable living world immensely the saddest part of all might be that even the gameplay is subpar to previous games i can honestly not believe this isn t being brought up more by the souls community input buffer is messed up and anything that isn t an attack doesn t register half of the time resulting in your character just standing there after their animation recoveries as a result you end up spamming inputs to make sure they register which is pretty much an insult to what used to be fromsoft s gameplay standards the removal of the one button press to switch from 1handed to 2handed is also a huge downgrade and renders using the new 2 buttons combo virtually useless in battle as you have to wait for your character to recover from any animation before using it there s a weapon swing combo limitation which renders your character unable to continually swing more than 4 times in a row even with stamina left over all of this coupled to the fact jump attacks become pretty much the only viable option to deal sufficient damage for melee builds make up for a subpar fromsoft experience overall balancing is all over the place in every aspect they clearly intended elden ring to depart from previous games by giving more options and versatility to players which would have been fine if they had actually followed by balancing the game for every build type like they always had so far as it stands though it feels like the game was tested and optimized solely on the basis of a handful of op mechanics that make using anything else feel like self punishing melee veterans in particular will experience the strange feeling of playing an underperforming ds3 character against legions of the most beefed up enemies from the same game pvp of course suffers even more from it with a handful of op builds still reigning supreme 2 months after release this again reinforces the feeling that the game needed more time to be fine tuned bosses are for the most part the least solid fromsoft have designed ranging from too easy to broken hard by design the game starts off nicely with tree sentinel and margit but from godrick and onwards you realize bosses pretty much follow the same pattern of increasingly long stun locking combos followed by aoe attacks except for the ones being straight up gimmick fights like rykard there are a few exceptions like the fallingstar beast that genuinely feels like a souls boss pretty much all of those bosses of course get re used several times throughout the game even many of the major ones paradoxically decreasing the game s scale of grandeur the more you expand it and this is the end note you face as you near the end of the game what seemed grand and full of possibilities when you started has shrunk in size the more you ve played it rehashed content after rehashed content making you wish in the end it was smaller shorter but richer i ll end on a special note on multiplayer this is by far the worst experience me and my friends ever had playing a fromsoft game in that aspect the constant disconnections unjustified invisible gates gating off of entire regions once random bosses are defeated and broken pvp made playing with friends a very unpleasant experience there again fromsoft should have adapted their decade old model to this new genre they decided to tackle but they didn t they slapped what was an already convoluted system on a completely new game concept and it works worse than ever on top of it the dark souls 1 2 3 servers are still down after months and might never come back which is insult added to injury to their old fanbase i won t touch too much on the pc performance as many others did but it is pretty bad indeed it is also clearly bad optimization as the game is roughly ds3 with unremovable filters and the latter runs a lot better the eac anti cheat bandaid they applied to fix the exploits discovered pre release is for sure partly to blame on top of it it prevents you from installing any harmless mod if you want to keep playing online so if like me chromatic aberration filters hurt your eyes tough luck because there s no official options to remove it finally what a shame the game is beautiful and full of ideas and potential it would be unfair to not state it did take my breath away numerous times i was actually ecstatic in my first 20 hours but the feeling never stopped degrading after that except when i reached the capital only to fall from even higher after it again i really really wanted to love it and it was that close the game needed more time more development more fine tuning as it stands it is ultimately a mess if you look at it in it s entirety i would have chosen something more neutral than not recommended if it was an option but it s not obviously this review focuses on negative aspects as i feel those aren t shared enough i think the game desperately needs criticism after the ridiculous flawless 10 10 official post release reviews it s really not
