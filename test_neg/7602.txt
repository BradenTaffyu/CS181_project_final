2020 edit please read discussion in the comments below for a more complete view there are others with very different opinions from me and it would be helpful to see everyone s perspective edit i am seeing a lot of comments with statements like get gud rather than continue to respond to those individually i am included my comments rebuttals at the bottom of the review i love this game dearly however there are some key issues that need to be ironed out and i am torn on whether i would recommend your first 10 20 hours like me are going to be a dream you ll grab some friends and start sailin the seven seas and living your best pirate life but like me eventually you are going to start noticing a vile vile trend the most experienced players in the game which as the game gets older turn into a larger and large portion of the player base all follow the same basic deeply frustrating tenets when it comes to naval battles that is to say they don t instead experienced players use a storied exploit to board your ship and spawn camp you until you either die or scuttle in allowing for this play style to persist rare is preventing the central promise of the game to be fulfilled we will never have the pitched epic sea battles of our dreams regarding get gud hi denso thanks for reading i was talking about the speed swimming trick with the sword dash i know that it has become kind of enshrined within the community so that many people don t view it as an exploit however almost all of the people who i have played with kinda feel like its an exploit i hope this helps i d love to talk about this more i know that my view on this can be a little contentious especially because of how many of us in the community just use it like any other ability chrispsthunder i would agree with denso actually like i said in my review it is honestly a really great game but it just has some huge holes in the combat maybe you ll be able to look past it i just feel as though the sea battles aren t what i need them to be and i m still looking for that thank you everyone for the feedback i m seeing a couple comments talking about how the sword dash is a feature and that i just need to get better at repelling boarders first off thank you to denso i did not know this was a discussion the community had before i tried google ing it a little but to be honest my research was not that thorough so thanks i worry i may have misrepresented myself in my review the sword dash trick is a part of what i feel to be a larger issue the prevalence of boarding in the sea combat although boarding needs to be in the game i feel like its too easy rn as a result most sea battles are spent dealing with people trying to climb onto the ship and not maneuvering and firing cannons back and forth a really easy fix for this that a friend of mind mentioned would be the ability to pull up ladders that way if you wanted to board someone you would actually have to cannon yourself onto the deck or run up along side them to leap aboard in conclusion i understand if you feel the boardings are just another viable strategy but for me personally and i would imagine others this detracts from the naval combat as less time is spent on actual ship to ship combat and when people do board it feels less like a clutch maneuver and more run of the mill
