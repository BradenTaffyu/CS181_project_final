2022 obviously a great game but the technical issues are fairly crippling playing with a rtx 3070 on latest drivers yet the game consistently has issues from dropped frames to full freezes especially during enemy encounters which is about as frustrating as one can imagine in an already punishing game game will be close to perfect once these issues are fixed but i d recommend waiting until then to play on pc
