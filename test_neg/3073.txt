2018 this review is about the multiplayer part i don t really care about the singleplayer mode the online mode is a total ripoff you basically grind to get money constantly and grind to get rid of advertisements that try to get you to buy the fancy new thing that costs about 100h worth of grinding that s probably done on purpose to try to get people to buy the in game currency with real money it s not worth it for the multiplayer
