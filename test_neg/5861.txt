2020 another game ruined by ubisoft s incompetence it started off geat but has been progressively going down the drain ever since the middle of y1 it has slowly morphed from a fresh take on the hero shooter genre based around semi realistic interpretations of the world s best ctus to a full on semi futuristic overwatch with ubisoft and esports organizations bottling the esports scene which grows more and more toxic and elitist drastic and confusing gameplay changes in the name of balancing stablising the meta not to mention the unstable code the game sits on top of it s become very stagnant and is very slowly dying because of that i cannot recommend this game to anyone in the state it s in maybe in the past but not now
