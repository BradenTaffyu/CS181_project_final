seeing other reviews getting eaten alive for not having enough hours in game i hope 155 at the time of this review is enough i m not going to draw parallels to palworld or division actually the game feels more like a facelift of defiance if anyone remembers that trainwreck the game is fairly unique but everything about it was minimum effort it s like someone took a cup and just sampled every flavor from the soda fountain dispenser let s start with the first problem i encountered with the game it doesn t explain a damn thing my entire group failed to use the butterfly during the tutorial boss because it was poorly explained one friend went most of the game not knowing their territory qualified as a teleport tower would build their base near one to get around the map the next thing that gave me an ulcer was just all the damn menus escape should have game options and settings then you have another button for the menu to control all menus if you want to throw the option in for i for inventory or p for pizza that s fine but most games have a one stop menu shop so nobody has to go hunting for stuff next the map oh my god is the map awful it s like someone s first attempt to make a golf course in pga tour 2013 so many unnatural slopes jagged edges incomplete textures not to mention the wide expanses of nothingness you know why there s nothingness regionalizing this is the desert area this is the urban area this is the farm area booooo establishing your territory is a real you need resources to play the game and those resources can be acquired either through killing enemies which consumes resources or you can farm them autonomously through unlocking certain territory skills some skills are acquired through a very grindy rng process in which you can only reset one of these a week and if you don t roll up the skill you want whomp whomp better luck next week only to find out the faster way is to just loot the trunks of abandoned cars but the crux is the fact that there is no catch all area if you need fuel you have to move your entire territory to the oil field and pump oil from the ground not all of these exist in the same area and in the few special cases that two or more of those areas do overlap guess what yeah everyone else already figured that out and there s no room for you to be a neighbor 2 or 3 players get the privilege of the sweet spot that gives them oil and stardust the rest of you better luck next time when the game resets what reset yeah the game wipes every 6 weeks forcing you to start over from scratch sure you keep like some of your unlocks and all of your stuff gets sent to eternaland but transferring it from eternaland back to the real world is just another currency grind speaking of currency there are about 147 different types of currency and f k you if you think you can track them all in one place no you gotta go slogging through the different menus trying to figure out which menu showed which currency to buy what crap and you almost always never have enough what about weapons and equipment must be some cool loot in this looter shooter nah you gotta look for blueprints and you can only farm them from special chests that are a 1 time deal until the next reset or you can try your luck on the in game lotto system that can spit out random blue prints at the cost of yet another type of currency that is pretty much a to get your hands on all of this can actually lead a player to a point that it s impossible to progress in the game some players will get lucky and get the good stuff that allows them to put together the build of the week games like this are so poorly thought out that despite all the weapons and gear options there s only 1 that works well enough to succeed if you don t rng that stuff on your way to 50 you will run out of opportunities to get it and are either stuck with the grind stuck waiting until reset or stuck with what you have requiring you to get carried through the latter content don t think you can bring some unique playstyle into this you might get away with it in the early parts of the game for instance i wound up building an fun bullseye melee type where i would shoot an enemy and mark them then melee them for ridiculous damage and not only get another damage boost upon killing them but also self heal recover stamina and get a speed boost making the next kill even faster and easier too bad that whole thing hits a solid steel wall upon hitting 50 almost all of the bosses have some kind of goofy destiny square enix type shenanigan attached to them and while i enjoy me some boss mechanics i don t enjoy those that literally rip away any and all playstyles except for the one recommended by every dooshy vtuber channel there are countless balancing issues with crafting recipes that i can t possibly put them all here suffice it to say that any kind of crafting is effed six different ways and there s a high probability you could actually get stuck with low grade gear until the next reset rolls around again making it impossible to do any of the late season content territory building eugh it s about as well designed as the early dayz of dayz you have to trick most pieces to go into place tearing out and re engineering things to get pieces to fit that are supposed to fit together but won t because oops they didn t put in any concept of building down so if you wanna snap a piece underneath something forget it you have to put something under it first then add your piece then kick the stool out from under it dumb you d think a game like this would be heavy on the cosmetics it has about as much character creation cosmetic choice as a newgrounds flash game anything remotely interesting is locked either behind a paywall or rng you can play for 155 hours and only fine 1 type of couch whereas your friend will find the entire lay z boy lineup before they hit level 5 it s incredibly bogus sure okay it tries to encourage player trading but they f ked that up too the initial release of this game saw a lot of incoming players and they just kept creating vservers and after the initial surge all these servers are now dead lots of players registered to those servers but they re completely freakin empty you won t find a lot of players with a lot of excess items to trade because again the rng can be a bit of a bastard and you re lucky to get the one you already have let alone a second you can sell or give to a friend the same problem applies to crafting material sure you can set up a house in an area that you can automate acid but guess what you need that acid you need a metric sh t ton of it there is no compulsion to sell any of it what you can make a lot of is food lots of food anyone can make food and it expires fast so there s no compulsion to make it in excess and sell it you just make what you need for that session some of it has a spoil timer up to 9 days in a fridge but most of the useful stuff like ingredients are gone in a day what you farm today is rotten by the time you log in tomorrow useless pointless wasted effort okay all of this is fixable but developers are rarely caught fixing what was intentional to begin with it s not going to be fixed because it s not broken it s just inconvenient and games like this are not designed to be convenient it s a gotcha game for a reason and i realize that s not the proper spelling but you can t ignore the irony of the homophone it s a free game though so play it as you will but don t get suckered out of your money for cosmetics especially when most of those cosmetics are the price of a full f king game
