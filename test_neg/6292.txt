2020 a really fun and engaging game with some great tie ins and licensed killers and survivors and an overall fairly rewarding gameplay loop when it works the problem being that bhvr are some of the least competent devs in the industry they make some of the most baffling balance decisions i ve ever seen a dev team make like nerfing the only generator slowdown perk that worked immediately from the start of the match into borderline uselessness hyperbole it s a niche perk now but you need to essentially dedicate a build and playstyle around it instead of being able to use it to stem the tide of the earlygame generator rush when repair times were already too fast for majority of killers without map presence nerfing killers to the point of uselessness instead of making tiny tweaks ignoring killers who need buffs clown ignoring underpowered or overdesigned perks for both sides babysitter dark sense buckle up monstrous shrine etc or ignoring overpowered perks for survivors like decisive strike object of obsession and adrenaline that are must haves because of how swing y they are the toolbox nerf was a nice change at the very least but it didn t really do much to stop coordinated survive with friends swf teams from absolutely curbstomping most killers because of the unbalanced matchmaking that doesn t even really attempt to balance skill levels this combined with the seemingly willfull ignorance of bhvr interactive to add meaningful settings like brightness resolution etc to their game or accessibility settings like colorblindness settings which are a huge issue for a part of the community despite being asked about it constantly for nearly 4 years and their seeming incompetency at their own game by making baffling design and balance decisions that only benefit players of low skill while punishing the players who are committed to their game and want to play at the highest level makes me have little faith in them as developers the community is another touching point it s one of the worst communities i ve ever been a part of i can t go more than three matches without being told to kill myself or how i am and should uninstall because baby survivor timmy couldn t dodge a hatchet to save his life the toxicity goes both ways as well because both sides have broken options available to them to make the session living hell for the other side though i d argue that survivor tools are slightly more powerful than killer ones but only slightly keys moris adrenaline hex noed unbreakable decisive strike etc it really feels like a clown show of who can ruin the other sides day the most and yet i find myself coming back to the game again and again because the base game and concept are actually fairly solid but everything else makes me hesitant to recommend this game to anyone who is serious about it if i could give a middle thumb i would but steam has a binary yes no system and i m going to have to go with no in this case take that with a grain of salt however the underlying game itself is fun and engaging but the incompetency of the developers and the general of the community make it hard to recommend to anyone looking for a solo experience edit june 2021 so somehow the balance and buggy state of the game has gotten even worse i don t know how bhvr managed this but holy hell the game doesn t even work on most platforms anymore the game crashes constantly half the maps don t work the last three killers released have been fairly weak on launch with one of them being the actual weakest killer in the game by a significant margin perks are overtuned to the point of uselessness forget the middle thumb rating comment i gave before it s a hard thumbs down now bhvr are greedy devs who focus on fixing cosmetic issues and pumping out more dlc than fixing their pile of spaghetti they call code deadbyboycott
