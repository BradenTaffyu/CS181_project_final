2022 today my boyfriends mood was completely ruined by the news from creative assembly i spend hours trying to cheer him up and he s still in a bad mood personally i do not care much i only play occasionally but from hearing him talk about it i cannot help but getting a bit upset of how they choose to treat fans of the franchise they are letting their fans down and that is no way to run a business in my opinion they should have waited with the initial release untill the game was ready thanks for ruining a nice weekend with my bf
