at the current price tag i can t recommend this game this is probably the single worst pc port i have ever played the performance is bad denuvo probably doen t help with that there is mouse acceleration that cant be turned off fov is locked at 60 as a 65 euro aaa title it s a tragedy on the upside the story and gameplay is good so i will keep playing but i just can t in good faith recommend it as is hopefully all of the problems will be fixed later on
