2022 the good news is that warframe is free and you can actually play through all of the content without paying the bad news is that the gameplay is extremely repetitive and boring there are a couple enemy factions with their own locations but beyond that every level looks and plays the same and you will carry out the same missions over and over guided by a thin veneer of a story that is not interesting or meaningful in the least when the game came out 9 years ago the movement fighting mechanics and graphics felt fresh but it has really not changed since then and now just feels dated not to mention hard to pick up for a newcomer with its overwhelming amount of content warframe 2 is long overdue but hopefully it will be a more handcrafted experience and digital extremes will not leave everything to the rng generator next time
