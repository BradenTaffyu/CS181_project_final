2022 after roughly 1500 hours in this game across ps4 and steam i can safely say i m done this game has had a multitude of core design philosophy issues since launch that myself and many other players were willing to overlook but almost a decade later that goodwill is gone so what exactly are the problems 1 lack of identitythis game simply has no idea what it wants to be anymore it has morphed from a free to play randomly generated 3rd person shooter into whatever the hell this is de s idea of progression and innovation is to just half assedly copy and tack on lazily designed systems for no other reason than because other games have them did you like the nemesis system here s a grindy broken alternative do you like open world games here s 3 open worlds to grind through and even though they all look and play the exact f same you have to grind them all to unlock the massive glut of the game s content that has been arbitrarily gated off behind it do you like cod and destiny here s a hacked out multiplayer mode nobody plays with virtually all of the cool weapons and mods disabled do you like 2d fighting games here s a s y minigame where you have to re grind to unlock the characters you already have and 95 of the playerbase doesn t even know it exists it s clear that there is no actual endgame or coherent vision being worked towards every update is just a mindless race to inch closer towards copying every other game on the planet 2 monetizationthe only thing worse than nonsensical game systems carelessly stacked on top of each other is the inevitable monetization that comes with it while it s true that roughly everything in the game can be accessed for free the monetization of this game is a deliberately mystifying clusterf ck geared towards alienating new players and veterans alike with basic noob weapons still being sold for 20 each and absolutely untenable resource grinds that are clearly designed to confuse and or frustrate people into spending 3 refusal to listen to player feedbackperhaps the final nail in the coffin is the attitude the dev team has taken towards the player base in recent years from sudden account bans to punishing players because another person they traded with glitched in premium currency de seems to have adopted a much more indiscriminately cavalier attitude towards dealing with fans when they aren t actively alienating players they are busy implementing bafflingly backwards nerfs and design changes that don t accomplish anything but make the game less fun there s no point in trying to grind or unlock anything cool anymore because de will just nuke it to the ground once enough people catch wind of it in sum if you missed out on warframe during its heyday from 2015 2018 that ship has sailed and there s really no longer any reason to check it out now it sucks because this used to be one of my favorite games of all time and a shining example of how to do f2p right but now it s just another copy paste corporate grindfest de has every right to keep blindly throwing at the wall but long time players have no obligation to sit through it anymore
