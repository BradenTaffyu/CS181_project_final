2017 i m sorry this game was great until the final update came and ruined it from both the multiplayer and singleplayer the snigle player is no longer moddable and modding was the reason people went crazy for the game when it was released for pc the multiplayer where can i begin rockstar decided it was a good idea to force people into joining public sessions so they can try the new content not only that the community is the worst at this time the players are waiting for the others to approach their property so they can destroy their supplies and it s getting more digusting than ever this game was great was
