2017 i regret the money and most of the time spent on this game the singleplayer is uninspiring and multiplayer is a grindfest dependant on playing with friends to find any fun basic ui is unfunctional and frustrating the first gta i put decent time into and it will take drastic change before i buy another also take two is a dishonest greedy anti consumer group i have no intention of ever giving money again
