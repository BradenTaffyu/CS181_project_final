2016 great concept horrendous execution basically same story from when i participated in the beta and did not buy the game then was hoping it would be better than beta this time it s not disclaimer before all the fanbois say git gud i have a win rate going of about 80 by the time the beta ended i was winning almost literally every game i usually only lose if things are completely bonkers like the things listed below fun things all the bugs from when i did the beta are still there i ve been jammed in geometry twice now with half my legs sticking into the ground if the killer has bad internet your whole game is you teleporting into walls since he acts as server because he acts as server he controls the game basically his computer recieves and syncs all data from all survivors so his computer knows everything going on in game draw what conclusions from that you wish if the killer has really bad internet you might lose connection and that counts as you losing and him winning even though it was his internet that caused it matchmaking is non existent it just shoves you into the first available game so if you re new you could be going up against a ridiculously equipped killer or vice versa you re a killer up against pro survivors if you want to vault over two objects in a row to escape after vaulting over the first object the game will disregard the direction you are running completely and make you back flip back over the first object and straight into the killer s arms this is actually pretty funny since sometimes your arms bend in impossible ways did i mention desync if the killer has bad internet if he sees that he hit you on his screen but you re 20 feet away on your screen guess what you re still hit sometimes the game doesn t render objects so you ll slam right into an invisible wall or rock and tons of other riduclous things the steam s rules and guidelines won t let me mention without this getting deleted this is beta at best wait a year and for a deep deep sale i m thinking i ll buy during summer 2017 steam sale if it s 5 dollars or less friday the 13th the game that will be out soon and is same idea but will hopefully be far more polished this game was clearly rushed out the door possibly to capture the market before friday the 13th
