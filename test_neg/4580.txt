2021 if i had to summarize warframe it s as though the mantra wouldn t it be cool if was writ large everything about warframe lacks cohesion the devs don t consider game impact when they add new systems they don t consider how players will play the game after a new bit of content comes out worst of all the initial release of any new content is essentially a beta because it is full of bugs broken doesn t work right and leads to mass player disappointment there are all sorts of little bugs little problems little issues with game flow that constantly plague you as you play the game the devs don t seem to listen to complaints either overall i can t recommend this game it s never going to get better they re never going to fix the things that annoy you and the community is perfectly happy with just getting more of the same buggy broken game it s sad because the game has a lot of potential if they had just stuck with a tight core vision but it s clear that there s no real understanding of how people play the game or how to drive player behavior
