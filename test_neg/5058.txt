2022 call of duty modern warfare ii by wholfsummary well well well where to start let s say after 30 hours of grinding playing and being ear blasted by the helicopters which are highly annoying i came to the point of writing a review describing all the things from my experience so far i m right now after 20 hours of playing fully leveled 55 which is the maximum how by finishing the daily tasks and grinding did i enjoy it in general yes and no let me explain in an informative way the weapons i have maxed out the first four assault rifles to gold and i m almost finished with my fifth one and yes you can max out a weapon in around 2 hours of playing leveling is very easy and getting gold camo is also very easy as the challenges don t make any sense very simple and has no real challenge and in general feel quite bland while playing with these weapons it felt really unbalanced the recoil and the balance aren t fitting to the weapon the damage is strange and the attachments also feel like they aren t doing anything overall if you are grinding for gold do it it s very easy but here comes the negative part about grinding for the xp hundreds and hundreds of players used an exploit or whatever it s called you had to play the ground war mode and have the mine forgot the name of it thrown on a light tank by doing this you will get thousands of xp in no time teaming up with a friend of yours on their other team made this very easy to grind for xp just throw the mine on the light tank wait wait wait and boommm a lot of xp this also counted for your weapon which in my opinion didn t make any sense now this got patched but those who abused it leveled every weapon mostly to the maximum already the best thing i like about all the weapons available is the sound effects to it while shooting feels detailed and perfectly fitting to the weapon the maps in general well well well the maps and i m going to talk about it in general not map specific the maps in general are nice well covered and nicely made with some nice hiding spots and exploits here and there and freerunning places where you can camp around if you are playing farm 18 taraq or zarqwa for example you ll most likely see people being in places that shouldn t be possible to get to now the crappiest map ever made is santa sena border a map filled with hundreds of exploding cars and people camping behind them with shotties or snipers in the spawn it s unbelievably terrible and i hope they ll fix this as everyone most of the time simply quits leaves when they see this map now breenburg hotel is a map in the netherlands where i live it s nicely made and kinda reminds me of this place when i went there a few years ago but from what i ve heard the owner of this hotel is mad that call of duty added this not quite sure though but i ve heard it overall some changes glitches and exploits here and there and we re good to go btw i love farm 18 easy peasy knife hunting the connection crashes yep this is a very annoying thing the game crashes randomly the game freezes randomly and when playing a game your game lags i even hit my toe against the wall due to a game freeze while i had 18 killstreaks and related i hope they ll fix this as i have probably received over 50 crashes by now in 30 hours of playing there are a few fixes here and there and i did all of them but they came coming back but you know the developers are aware of it and hopefully fixes this in one week from now overall the game has just been released so you can expect these things of course did i enjoy the cooperative game modes yes and no why because almost everyone is using the god mode exploit which is very easy to do rushing to the point no stealth nothing and when you are playing stealth the ai sees you anyway i have tried so many times that it s just a waste of time since the ai will see you anyway i even tried shooting those armored vehicles with rpgs and other launchers and they couldn t even be destroyed like what the apache helicopter is also a way to be overpowered once it comes it s hard to destroy unless you both focus on it with a launcher overall the cooperative game mode is fun besides what i ve mentioned you can even find intel but that ll take a huge amount of time to find all of them best part is you can get emblems backgrounds when you ve achieved enough stars did i enjoy the game in general yes i did enjoy it besides the crashes and the highly unfair skill based matchmaking not that it s a huge problem but you ll be killed loads of times by these people camping in corners with shotguns camping with snipers 200 meters away headshotting you or even killing you through walls i have encountered 3 hackers legit ones using wallhacks people screaming and shouting into their microphones and even being very toxic to the players in the matches uhm what else it s quite boring now and i ll take a break almost all my assault rifles are gold my riot shield is gold and my knife is gold what else i could continue but once you ve completed leveling to 55 and leveling your weapons it starts to simply get boring as of right now it feels like a game that you play when being bored since you ve achieved the most part of the game i hope they ll fix the game more add more content here and there fix the huge amount of problems and listen to their community and not their own minds is the price right now worth it no it s not it s way too high priced and you will get 20 30 hours of content unless you are a hardcore camo grinder in this game cause you know gold wow but in general do i recommend this game i wish i could vote neutral 50 50 but i ll go with a negative for now will update it in the future
