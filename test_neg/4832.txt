2023 after 521 hours of game play i have finally uninstalled this game in my humble opinion this game is a shameless money grab full of bugs useless and most of the time ugly bundles filled with mediocre skins and nothing but one of the worst hit detection software i have ever seen of course when the game actually launches and starts working properly it looks stunning the graphics are indeed amazing with beautiful realistic scenery and great character models but even then it is so badly optimised that it crashes almost every single week at least 7 or 8 times after that the campaign is bland and repetitive with very few exceptions and the plot is quite silly at that as for multiplayer and warzone 2 0 the multiplayer is filled with riot shield rocking shotgun using campers most of the maps are dreadful and the cherry on top is the newly implemented skill based hit detection so if you play really well instead of getting rewarded you get nothing but the most unbelievable ghost shots anyone has ever seen just great and at last warzone 2 0 i never expected to have fun playing a gamemode so unfulfilling as this all in all though even with all the campers and warzone 2 0 is really fun as long as you don t invest to much of your time in it and you appreciate it for what it is a mediocre battle royale game with texture loading issues unnecessary skill based matchmaking and latency variation that would make even the most well composed amongst us lose it this game was so promising and at the end i am ashamed that i wasted so much of my time buying and playing a game that is unfinished filled with errors and micro transactions that would even make companies such as ea and ubisoft vomit and still demands 70 euros for the standard edition why would you buy it sure it can be fun but when the trade off is 70 bucks for a game that is unfinished even after 11 months since the initial launch back in september last year and almost losing your mind after the first 100 hours of skilled based matchmaking in casual gamemodes such as resurgence in my opinion it is not worth it
