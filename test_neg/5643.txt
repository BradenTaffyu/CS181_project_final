2019 this game is actually incredible and has a lot of potential to be one of the best fps games out there but i only recommend this game if you will play with a full party of friends from all the fps games i ve played so far this one has the worst community i ve ever seen and the worst part is there are only a few punishments or no punishments at all implemented to punish people for their actions as so people get incredibly annoying do whatever they want leave ranks whenever they want
