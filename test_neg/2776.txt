2017 do not support a company that doesn t support its community it s not rockstar s fault but take two mod content is what have made me play it for a long time even it had the biggest map in gta games i felt the single player campaign was the shortest one in entire series multiplayer was fun but had a flaw like any other mp game cheaters but that existed even before openiv had support for gta v and will continue to happen after this bombshell they have should spent less with lawyers and more with developers to enhance the anti cheat system even talk with openiv team to verify that info and work with them with some solution if that was really true but now it s done there is no way back if i feel the urge to do some killing spree i know where i can find it on good ol playstation 2 san andreas in carl johnson hands
