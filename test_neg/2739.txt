rockstar has completely neglected gta 5 online on pc and let modders run rampant yet they keep selling this game at a discount to lure people to buy this malware of a game in every lobby there is now at least 1 modder carpetbombing the city or in godmode griefing people or generally messing up your grind and if you re like me and you call these people out you risk getting cyberstalked by them this personally happened to me after they took offense to my lighthearted jabs at them nothing more they then stalked me in every lobby teleported me all over the map blew my car up my bulletproof tires made me trip when running and steered my car into oncoming traffic basically had full control of my character whenever they wanted to hell they even closed the game several times and twice my internet connection stopped working while playing they then proceeded to stalk me and had access to whenever i would pop up online i figured it out after one of them told me that they had me on some sort of a list i recall saying things like look modders your hax are really cool ok or they need the mods to make up for their mental deficits i m certain those coments were enough for them to chose to take it upon themselves to mentally torture me whenever they could last time i played the game yesterday i talked to them and they said they wanted respect so i uninstalled the game later did some research and found that these modders not only can take all your ingame money from you and alter your lvl they also have access to your ip and can possibly also find ways to remote control or directly implant malware on your computer read people saying some modder deleted applications on their desktop and stuff like this it s not worth it having your computer hacked or destroyed because of vindictive nerds in desperate need of social validation it s unacceptable rockstar you re among the most profitable game companies to date and you chose to reward these people and punish the fans who bought your product if gta 6 online is anything like this don t buy it
