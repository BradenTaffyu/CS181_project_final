this game has been ruined from controller if you like to get aim assisted into the ground while they run a three stack then go ahead on top of not fixing controller they reward apex player with still no regs the controller has so much aim assist its a joke no skill is required to play this game if you play with a controller all you have to do is push your control stick forward and allow the aim of a controller not the player do the work this game will never recover from the amount of controller hacking lobbies and re spawn answer to that is selling a 360 death create dont play this game even if its free also if you do manage to find yourself a good lobby which is very far and in between you are quickly humble by a three stack of master to pred players i dont play this game very often the 300 plus hours have been spread over many years of this game coming back hoping it gets better they dont care about a balance system ie horizon is still the most played broken champ you can pick while they nerf and force you to play the same characters also you think that with the time it takes for them to release things that new champs would have new and innovated ideas wrong every new champ just is a better version of the base champs that were released at launch making the old champs outdated not only are they outdated but have the same or similar abilities as the base champ but a better version new weapons no they take weapons away to not fill the loot pool which is a understandable reason but then you take the base amount of weapons and turn 3 into weapons you use for 2 seasons straight if you dont use these buffed weapons when they made their season tweak then you are out gun from the start to top if off after 3 seasons its still accepteable to have out of the map hiding spots or to health yourself 300000 yards from the safe zone only to secure your masters spot in rank the game only gets worse if you dont have a three stack if you are a duo and a random as a 3rd then its ok that they solo drop die in 3 4 seconds when they land because the game doesnt pushing inting that said player that doesnt want to play with a team is reward by getting to return to lobby after quiting only to start a game 5 seconds later tell me how that is accpetable if you made changes to respawning a tm to make it easier but if fast to quit a game screw the duo team and just load up again playing a support player feels like only supporting the teammates you que in with because they are willing to stick around dead game dead community dead company
