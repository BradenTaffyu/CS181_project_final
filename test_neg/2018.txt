2023 nope don t recommend it at first its fun then you get ranked up and start noticing a trend asian players using vpn s to play on na server nothing says a fun time like getting into a match only to get perma juggled to death by someone who clearly has absolutely no life look at the na leader boards full of kanji you wont see anything else also they que up at the same time and help each other win and don t kill each other until they are the only ones left iv e had it happen multiple times and you keep watching them do it to other parties and there are just straight up hackers also then there is the ridiculous gotcha system on a paid game i don t mind buying a skin if i want it but to be random and have a 0 2 chance lmao get serious i will never pay for that iv e already paid for the game not playing roulette on top of it basically i m hard stuck playing against the top 10 of players in na and was solar rank last season so take my word for it when i say its not fun at that point at all same stuff every match
