2016 this is a case of wasted potential alright i don t like putting up negative reviews since most of the time it just comes down to personal preference when i don t like a game but this is just hilarious first off the game itself is not bad at all in fact i really enjoy playing it the concept and gameplay elements are great and me and my friends already had a lot of fun playing this but i just can t deal with the bad things going on this game for starters the matchmaking is just plain bad in casual and rankeds alike it s probably the worst i ve ever seen since cs go competitives it s neither fun nor helping me improving my game always having to play against people who have hundreds of hours more gametime than me and while i may be able to overlook this in casuals the rankeds are almost impossible to win with the kind of players the matchmaking comes up with best example me and a friend both on like silver 3 had to play against a group with one gold guy and even two platinum guys which was probably because the other two silverguys in the enemyteam got boosted by these guys so my question is why is that even possible even cs go prevents boosting of that magnitude and in every other ranked we played we always got matched against people who were of higher rank than us not even one time were they lower than us also the matchmaking in rankeds takes really long i would understand that if it would match us with people of the same skilllevel but thats not what it does so why does it even take so long second this one has become really rare but it still happens there is a kind of gamebreaking bug where after you pick your operator and the time runs out there comes a short loading screen and then you get into the game the bug simply wont let the loading finish and you are mostly stuck there forever i think there was like one time where it finished loading after like 5 minutes but in all other cases it wouldnt start even after 30 minutes so this is a aaa game published by a pretty big company this bug existed since the beta and they still havent been able to fix that so i basically paid money for not being able to play the damn game because every 2 or 3 games that bug happens maybe it s just my bad luck but that doesnt change the fact that it exists for months and i haven t found any statement as to why this happens and if they are actually concerned about that or no third the anti cheat system aka fairfight edit so this one is kinda obsolete now they got a clientsided anticheat now as far as i know it consists of analyzing your keystrokes while playing to see if you push any button which is not binded in the controls a fair number of times for like hackmenus etc and of course checking kda with skilllevel blablabla so bascially its a math based algorithm what happens when you have a math based algorithm and the possibility to report people ingame after you get owned by a player yes you get banned wether you actually cheated or not which is actually what happened to a friend of mine after getting a few good flickshots on his enemies so he got suspended from the game for a few minutes even though he just played normally twice great stuff not like we don t have any experiences of bad completely automatic anti cheatsystems it usually results in more work for the support oooh wait the support doesn t care at least thats what i could see by seeing multiple threads regarding anti cheat and other topics like that little bug where the people basically got no answer even after weeks of waiting well best anti cheat system ever still that s not the worst problem since i m not affected because i m bad at shooter anyway anyway forth the netcode on console this might even work in favor of the players as they are playing with controllers so some delay will work in their favor as they need longer to aim at their target but we are playing this on a computer we don t have that problem but ubisoft didn t account for that just made a simple port and now it just feels like another call of duty edit soo this game has been here for over a year now the netcode has not been fixed at all yay another thing i wanted to add in addition to the bad netcode the game also suffers from bad hitbox detection also since release so you hit your enemy in the head too bad you get killed while he didn t even take damage while on other occasions you get hit in the torso but it counts as a headshot or let s say you are standing in front of him he kills you with a neckshot which does double damage i might be mistaken but the neck is the backside right oh what would i know of anatomy the last but least important thing the community judging from all those reviews on steam the community is the best of every game in existence okay maybe thats overestimating it but still there are alot of those reviews comparing it to like cs go yes the community is by far better but on the other hand cs gos community is one of the worst things i ve seen anyway any yes mostly the people who actually did talk were nice and easy to talk to but still there were more than enough people i played with or against who though they were the best in the world and being arrogant and all that stuff which was kinda annoying so i don t really get why people would go all over the good community like that when it s actually like any other game just a little tone better hey maybe thats just my experience again because of bad luck or whatever but still i can t help but think that the majority of these reviews are bought or just people who got caught in the hype train which is never a good thing also casuals communitybasically a bunch of tryhards hardcorecamping as defenders and attackers doing everything they can to win and not to have fun well thats really just my opinion and not influencing the review directly but it emphasizes the previous point these points results in me not being able to recommend this game even though it can be a lot of fun at least not at this point in time i really hope that at least that stupid bug as well as the anti cheat system will be adressed by its developers in the near future but until then save your money edit so it has been a year i still play the game i can still sometimes enjoy it but it s still not worth the money
