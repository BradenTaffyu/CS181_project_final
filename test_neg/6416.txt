2016 game isn t finished and developers are already making more content which will cost the game is fun and i ve had alot of fun with it but still needs some more work and i personally think that chapter killers like the nurse from the last breath wich was free and know the latest killer the hag from of flesh and mud chapter should be of no charge and then the special event killer like michael myers from halloween and maybe some christmas killer should be behind some kind of price wall
