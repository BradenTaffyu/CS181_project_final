2017 let me first say that i have really enjoyed my time with this game i have had alot of good times either racing friends or wacking some random pedestrian with a baseball bat but as you may have heard and if you havent heard you must have been living under a rock because jesus the steam reviews have lit up like a christmas tree take two interactive the parent company for rockstar games has sent a cease and desist to a certain mod called openiv this mod is the backbone of at least half the mods for gtav essentially meaning taketwo has killed modding in one fell swoop so let me ask this take two interactive was it not enough to sell three different versions of your game was it not enough to shove shark cards down our throat by making online an unbearable grind to the top was it not enough to release almost no content for single player forcing modders to take action was it not enough to have your game be best selling in steam almost every weekthe greed here is so obvious and as such i have a little bit of advice for whoever at take two had this marvalous business plan i want you to install a rick and morty mod on your game take your cease and desist and shove it way up inside your buthole morty toodles
