2022 update finished the game after 60 or so hours including the secret areas i ve skipped some optional ruins and minor dungeons gonna leave the original review below for reference again this review won t talk about performance and optimization issues widely acknowledged by everyone and still hopefully to be patched sooner or later first the good it s always nice to be back to souls games the formula behind these games is a winning one addicting charming challenging they are good games and with the right mindset very enjoyable ones elden ring is no different in that sense it manages to deliver the same engrossing experience we all came to love during these years for the record i ve been playing souls games since demon s soul which remains still one of my favorites now let s tackle the issues i ve got with elden ring the gameplay formula is my main gripe here there are other problems i will address later but this here is the true source of my frustration which inevitably spoiled most of the enjoyment i had people say that it all started with ds3 but personally i believe it was a slow process of memification of the souls genre gameplay the git gud mentality behind it all which steered all design decisions towards what i consider now a pure cbt and ultimately unfun experience the perfect summary i ve read around is it feels you re playing dark souls while every enemy is playing bloodborne slow uncancellable animations are sometimes so annoying it feels you re playing with 500 ping all the time most of the bosses and even enemies are hysterical aoe spamming madlads with perfect hit tracking inconceivable hitboxes and so many aoe moves that sometimes they feel copypasted imagine pontiff sulyvahn on crack not enough ok now imagine zoning aoe bosses sorta like laurence of crack that s 90 of how i felt my experience with elden ring and it makes me sad to think about bosses like rennala it felt like i was fighting a real witch the fire giant aoe monster but slow and earth shattering or even the stupid mimic how unique and interesting they felt even radahn had an incredible concept but holy mother of god in the end it became spam y to summon meat puppets and dodge the oneshot hits i m not gonna talk about malenia i m not gonna do it too soon said that the other secondary but still quite perceivable issue i ve got here is the amount of recycled content and how derivative most if the world feels is the open world empty not really but i believe they ve chosen quantity over quality the more i played the more i felt diminishing returns in exploration and boss fighting enjoyment some bosses appear again and again during the game sometimes as minibosses sometimes as slightly reskinned new bosses sometimes oh wait there s two now areas start repeating themselves very soon and biomes only offer some respite in the creeping familiarity that inevitably kicks in after a while the most jarring example of this is the siofra river area and boss design absolutely incredible gameplay of the area not really a fan of aimbot snipers but hey it s easily rushable so whatever boss simple fascinating one of the most memorable music track in the game they basically copypasted everything from lightning the beacons to unlock the boss fight to the boss fight itself with a couple of added gimmick moves why not only it feels cheap but it manages to take out the beauty and uniqueness of the area you encountered the first time so yeah i confirm my suspicions of my early review elden ring feels like a step back for from software compared to a bloodborne or a sekiro not only it s their comfort zone it s the festering blight town comfort zone where the souls franchise is now sitting in semi stagnation open world and jumping are not enough to call it the most daring souls ever made good game yes mediocre souls also yes original review elden ring is a classic souls game exactly what you d expect which is why i find it disappointing i find the raving reviews talking about the most daring and ambitious souls game ever misleading compared to the dark souls franchise s gameplay elden ring doesn t feel much different i frame rolls parries critical attacks jump attacks are just another way to trigger them poke and repeat bloodborne a game from 2015 tried to innovate the formula in a more meaningful way and it felt different at least a tiny bit sekiro released before elden ring completely revolutionized the formula and soaked it in crystal meth how can you say that elden ring is the most ambitious souls game when older souls game tried so much harder to shake things up sadly to me elden ring feels like a step back the open world aspect feels gimmicky a way to follow nowadays trend where every game should have a crafting system and a faraway mountain you can go to the world so far has felt empty just a bland grassland linking together various areas and dungeons some of which are truly wondrous siofra river anyone but most got me saying i ve been here before all souls game feel like rites of passage with sweat and pain you git gud and when you git gud you are able to delve deeper in a mysterious world or enjoy a gorgeous new scenery or have the chance to wreck a new abomination s ass this time the suffering is starting to feel a bit more pointless which is a shame is it a good game yes is it a good souls game no so far i ve found it uninspired and bland one of the weakest of the franchise
