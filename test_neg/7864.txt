2021 before you buy this game if all you want to do is sail around and blow up other ships this is your game this is a pvp game now this is not a pirate adventure game most of the adventurers have gone on to other games the dev s have committed to the pvp crowd recently releasing events that focus entirely on sinking ships i m not asking the devs to change their game it can be pvp you pvp players don t have to defend the game from me this is just a recommendation for those players who are looking for adventure to look somewhere else its fun and exciting if someone tries to steal your loot to benefit themselves but usually its just players looking to sink ships and kill other players ignoring the loot to pvp i have to stress these players are not playing for treasure they are playing for the satisfaction of ruining other peoples quests flying under non pvp flags sinking the ship and sailing off ignoring the treasure yes there are people who will say this isn t their gameplay but this was my gameplay especially recently it gets tiring very quickly if you are a part of the pirate adventure crowd oh and to review gameplay i suppose the enemies are repetitive just all skeletons theres only a few types of quests it makes sense why they focus on the pvp now
