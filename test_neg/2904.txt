2019 currently sitting at around 666 hours played so i figured now would be the time to leave this review i ve played this game since the 360 and xbox one on and off recently i switched over to pc however as character transferring was shutdown i was frustrated i would even have been fine with a 1 character account transfer it s obvious i ve been a long time member to summarize what i have learned in the past month or so of playing on pc i will list the pros and cons pros story is excellent modding single player is always fun online can be extremely fun open world especially with friends plenty of cars and customization for gearheads as well as a variety of different weapons to choose from both easy and challenging missions heists community can be go either way of being toxic or extremely fun cons modders if you play this game expect to run into some modders whether they re friendly or not is up to luck they can either spawn in vehicles and be fun or give everyone money and destroy cargo you re trying to sell for some odd 100s of thousands of dollars i meet one almost everyday my suggestion is to play in an invite only session when you can or if you need a public lobby with only you there are ways to make your own that google can help you find griefers when you aren t getting harassed by a modder you meet a griefer there are people who will blow you up over and over until you go into passive mode or that destroy your cargo note that these people don t get anything out of destroying it except to just be mean the excuse that the games tells them to doesn t make them less of an ding dong crashes i m not sure if this is due to modders or my own game but sometimes about once or twice a day i ll get the random crash and have to wait through the 10 minute loading screen note that modders can boot you out of a session and crash your game however edit i haven t crashed as of recently but i am still looking out for this one closely as i believe it is on rockstar s side game age while i admit i m surprised to see this game as lively as it is right now no game lasts forever if gta 6 has an online feature gta 5 online won t be getting as many if any updates and most of the playerbase will switch so if you re brand new it might not be worth the effort to get into a warzone as this especially in it s current state mk2 oppressor do you think missiles are bad enough what about jets now imagine making a jet and compacting it into bike form that s right you have the oppressor mk2 a flying jet bike that can shoot missiles one of the most adaptable pretty fast vehicles in the game is also used for griefing for obvious reasons anyone that plays gta should maybe if needs one of these while they are fun to move around in they can also be very annoying this concludes my review of the game as far as rating would go i have a decent amount of fun on this game when i m not being tormented by modders if it were free of modders i would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 in its current state however i would say a 5 or 6 if you can make your own public lobbies then it isn t too much of a problem though thanks for reading i would suggest getting the game if it is on sale and only if it is on sale and trying it for the time steam allows you to before you can t refund it
