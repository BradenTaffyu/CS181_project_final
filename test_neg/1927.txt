first of all i really like the game gameplay is fun and it s a really pretty game not much to complain about in that regard that being said i was offline for a week and my territory got deleted not that big of a problem in theory because the game saves your buildings etc as a blueprint and you can move and rebuild your territoy anywhere you want anyways in theory only problem you most likely can t rebuild exactly where it was before because there will be a rock a tree the terrain or whatever colliding with the blueprint so the game won t let you here i thought no problemo i ll just shove it more into a lake or river and just partially rebuild the entrance only downside the game won t let me place my territory even if the place i choose is suitable after about 30 mins of trying and several outbrakes of mild tourettes i decided f k this piece of s t building system i ll just build new from scratch so i canceled the blueprint and set my territory marker now i am waiting for server verification during that time i can t leave the building menu or the game will cancle the action and i have to start again that means for the last 60 mins i have been standing around like an a hole with my d k in my hand doing f k all cause i can t go do anything because i have no territory to return to anymore and that means i have nowhere to unload my full inventory until the server decides to start working again meanwhile i have been playing the fun game of try to contact the support which is working about as well as the f king servers brilliant now i ll go and ragequit and maybe try again tomorrow or whenever i have a couple of hours to waste
