2021 as i got farther into the game it just got more and more boring granted i am 600 hours in but after the 600 hours i just feel like its the same thing on repeat i love grindy games but this grind is more annoying than cookie clicker i understand it is meant to be grindy but each mission feels the same and once you are broken you are just sitting in a corner with your abilities on waiting for the drops you need no action just waiting
