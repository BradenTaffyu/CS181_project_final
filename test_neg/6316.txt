2018 seems like the game was built in mind for the survivors to not have comms when they do game over there s a good amount of killers but only about three of them can deal with the bs good survivors will put you through the balence of this game is definetly out of wack most of my complaints about this game is about the killer role i switch to survivor when i want to have a good time outside of a killer choosing to camp you there s not too much they can do to ruin your time wheras a survivor can win and get the doors open then choose to waste your time staying in the level because they will not leave till you walk to the door and watch them teabag you i like the idea of the game but its way too easy for the survivors to bully the killer and at that point the game feels like a joke
