2017 while single player mode is enjoyable multiplayer is plagued by rockstar s attempts to empty your wallet the methods to make money in multiplayer are tedious and not very rewarding for the work you do the worst thing about multiplayer is that they ve recently adopted some new terms for playing which basically say that they ll delete your multiplayer accounts without need for explanation which is basically what happened to me a few years worth of progress completely deleted with no explanation so yeah if you really want to play it then do so but don t buy any shark cards it isn t worth it and you can t get refunds for them either
