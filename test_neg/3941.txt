2016 the game itself is a lot of fun especially when playing together with friends in an online session time flies by and there s a ton of stuff to do and to explore if i would really recommend this game but the support of rockstar games sucks big time i got banned without any comprehensible reason okay this might happen so i m fine with this but i tried to get some further information how this could have happened and this is were the fail of the support starts any mail or support ticket i wrote was blocked of by some automated message just telling me to leave them alone all other attempts to get in contact were just ignored i tried it for several days but always the same outcome so if you want to get judged by random cheat finding algorythims and kicked in the gutter by their support team please buy this game
