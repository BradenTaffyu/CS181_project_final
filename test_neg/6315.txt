2021 used to play this game a lot and thought i would try to get back into it the same problem they had since a year or two ago 90 of new perks are just gimmicky and there is no point to running them and every match pretty much plays the same way behaviors best bet is to sell the game to a company and dev team that would actually know what do to with the gamethat being said get the game if you are willing to grind hours to get the cool perks the youtubers use this game will take at least 50 60 hours to get even a couple of those broken survivor or killer perks you see youtubers and streamers use so if you are willing to drop 50 60 hours just to get another 50 100 hours of somewhat enjoyable playtime and then get bored then buy ittldr if you are willing to drop almost 100 hours into getting all of the good perks for either killer or survivor and then deal with bugs glitches terrible balancing updates and one of the most toxic communities in gaming then sure get the game
