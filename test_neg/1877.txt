2022 i agree with 88 of the recent 6000 negative reviews the game is still buggy and ca has massively reduced the updates and added update content it s a shame the game itself has potential but they destroy it and not just cause of their lazy updates we are still waiting for updates for norsca we paid for this dlc another sample uk has an inflation of 6 8 the average inflation in the uk computer industry is even lower so if someone decrease the content around 33 and increase the price about 150 there is no way to explain this no publisher did this and dev s also not it s feeling like a punch in the face of loyal customer so ca crossed a line and people are sick of it no more free advertisment
