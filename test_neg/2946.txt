2016 i feel i can only write a review for gta online as grand theft auto v has been left in the dust since it launched on pc all of rockstar s attention goes into gta online now buying gta v is basically just a means of distribution for the online component i m level 99 or something like that i feel i ve played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it so let s begin base game hasn t recieved an update since the first weeks of launch they don t even port online cars to it anymore and they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer looks like they don t want you trying something before you spend half a million gtabucks on it only to find you don t like it very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes most of the time it s the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two a gun that no one wants like the antique pistol for example and some tacky clothing options for an online game that s technically been going for 3 years there s been very little innovation the whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys and once you ve got everything you want and once you get bored of the missions adversary modes and races and get tired of screwing around in freemode the game becomes pointless just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving chrome adders and sitting on golden yachts rockstar doesn t think when it comes to implementing game features the bad sport system is horribly abused more often than not i find myself getting bad sport points for doing nothing else but defending myself against an armoured kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight do that enough and all of a sudden you re broke and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters not that there s any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones and on the topic of cheating the cheating is just insane it s out of control rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game and usually it s not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co op mission more often than not it s just straight out griefing getting c130s dropped on you cars exploding for no reason having a gang of stripper npcs with miniguns spawned on you and then you ve also got people who spawn moneybags on others which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because rockstar rarely bans punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money just the one who spawned it they slap cheaters on the wrist often using a strike system the first 2 or 3 times you re caught you get banned for a week or two it should be permanent there is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys racists griefers hackers tryhards screamers and squeakers freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off and play with all the things you earned during your missions and you re extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn t full of hackers raging griefers with tanks or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice chat gta online is like one of the seven circles of hell it s a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half wits who get off to a toxic unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment it s a shame because gta v isn t that bad of a game i think gta iv was ahead of it s time and i still enjoy it even though it doesn t run too well anymore for some reason but gta v has largely been forgotten since it first launched because in this industry if an action game isn t an online game it s irrelevant gta v an impressive technical achievement hit some nails on the head missed some others compared to it s predecessors gta online a toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs
