2022 it s a fun game but it is poorly advertised it is shown to be an adventure style exploratory game however it couldn t be more wrong yes there is an adventure style play to it but you will more so these days run into excessively toxic people sailing the sea of thieves yes it has a strong element of pvp and pve however the mass majority you seem to encounter in game automatically jump to hostile pvp and use racial and sexual slurs berating you if you don t fight them on their terms and a load of other things that make you question the sense of decency of those who play this doesn t speak for everyone however it just feels like you run into those more than anyone else you can report these people but even doing so you need proof and a lot of the time it doesn t feel like it does any good aside from the people who gain immense joy from ruining the fun by being such wonderful examples of humanity it does have a very expansive world with beautiful graphics a rather colorful and wonderful storyline with continued development coming every season there does feel like a limit to it however as if the game does have a point where you ve just done everything so you get kinda bored just sailing around doing the same old same old as you wait for the next big thing but that s the only in game downside
