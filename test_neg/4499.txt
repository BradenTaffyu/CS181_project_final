2021 hate to leave a negative review but the game s direction during the past few years leaves a lot to be desired we waited 3 5 years for the new war to be released and it ultimately didn t change the game at all and continued the cycle of waiting years for actual content that is worth playing the new war was good but it wasn t enough to retain my interest in the game we spent 3 5 years waiting grinding open worlds new primes new frames new weapons and of course other games all filler content made for us to grind just for grind s sake i m tired of the excuses that the game is f2p and filled with stuff to do because at the end of the day none of it means anything players regularly leave the game en masse after big updates because we are understandably frustrated with how little there is to enjoy in the core gameplay i am really hoping de does something to make the game feel alive again because much of the game feels like wasted potential the question now is how many more years do we have to wait for the next major story update until that update arrives there are better time investments than this
