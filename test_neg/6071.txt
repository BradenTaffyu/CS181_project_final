2017 i ve played since the beta and had a lot of fun with it it s amazing value for money and has almost limitless replayability the game was incredibly buggy and still stuffers from issues today although the devs keep dropping patches fixes and small gameplay tweaks to help improve things and its come a long way with many positive improvements sadly i have to say that the game seems to have drifted into a very bad place and needs to serious work to put it back on track ultimately the premise of the game is based around hide and seek where the seeker is a killer hunting for his her prey the survivors these survivors are in constant fear for their lives and must try to repair generators as quickly as they can in order to power the exit gates so they can flee the killer and reach safety this is the problem the contant fear just isn t there any longer survivors simply taunt and run rings around killers often armed with a vast array of tools and perks readily at their disposal addiitonally teams of friends can communicate over voice chat giving a monoumenal tactical advantage against the killer major work is needed on the game in order to bring about some balance at the moment killers are often too powerful against newer or less skilled players whilst at the same time survivors become far too powerful in the late game changes need to be included that keep the same level of fear new players experience and make escaping the killer actually challenging at all skill levels this keep things fun for everyone its more rewarding to know you escaped when the odds were stacked against you and keeps killers engaged in the game moving on to dlci ve purchased all dlc so far and been quite happy with the chapters some good some average until the most recent one freddy krueger aka the nightmare there was a lot of excitement around this new licenced killer and when it was released i found it to have quite a learning curve although it was very easy to track and down a single survivor it was quite tricky to manage all 4 of them and resulted in a lot of running about in chases ultimatley i found him a little weak but with the right perks and techniques i could see him being a fun killer just one week after release a tsunami of hatred fell upon freddy from the survivor community calling for nerfs and complaint about him being too strong many of them being very new to the game as i mentioned earlier inexperienced players will struggle early on and shouldnt be a judge of game balance from one side the nerf hit a few weeks after release with freddy suffering badly in all areas whilst the devs didn t go ahead with 100 of their initial planned nerfs the ones that they brough in were completely uneccessary and went too far destroying a paid dlc killer based on the loudest cries from the community freddy now stands a shadow of his former self and has become the weakest killer in the game which is a shame as im sure he was play tested and balanced internally before all of that was just thrown away behavior digital have seen the last of my money and i will no longer purchase any future dlc i ll continue to enjoy the game playing as surivor and killer but have been burned by this recent decisions and will stick to consuming the free content thats offered with the hope that they learn lessons and attempt to put the game back on course to where it should be in summary pros game is amazing value for money especially in the sales procedurally generated maps make for high replayability active development new patches and changes open and engaging with community on development new free content included not just paid dlc very active player basecons still major bugs in game even so long after release including save game loses high levels of toxicity im looking at you post game chat game promotes bad play styles infinite pallet looping hook camping poor balance between killer and survivor playing killer as killer at rank 1 is not fun and swf can be a joke a round can be ruined for others when a player purposefully disconnects which happens far too often i reach rank 1 killer and rank 1 survivor after each reset and have played serveral hundred hours as both sides hopefully that gives me a little weight behind my experiences so far in reviewing this
