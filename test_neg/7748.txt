2022 tldr mandatory pvp game with terrible pvp mechanics and no concept of risk reward balancing the game needs pvp to work but the current mechanics make for terrible gameplay and overly incentivise toxic behaviour there is plenty of pve content and they keep adding more of it and it s fun but if you spend any decent amount of time doing pve you will have to protect your hoard in pvp which is fine it s a pirate game as the barking seals often remind me but 99 of the time you encounter someone who wants to pick a fight it s some fresh spawn with no loot who will attempt to steal your hard work with no risk to themselves your options are 1 run you can t really get away unless they let you get away but if you spend half an hour on nothing but helm and sails you might wear out their patience or they might literally follow you around the map forever not fun in the slightest 2 fight the ship side of naval combat is actually pretty good except that chainshot is utterly broken against sloops and i have no friends but that s just me the other side of naval combat is crews using overly forgiving respawn mechanics to kamikaze their players onto your ship using throwables dropping your anchor stealing your supplies respawn camping or just swimming across with a gunpowder barrel this boarding can be done from great distances by firing people out of cannons at no risk beyond a small wait to respawn and once they re on your ship pirate on pirate combat sucks it s janky clumsy and the hitreg is awful when i imagine pirates boarding ships and fighting each other a single fat man with a blunderbuss jumping up and down side to side to avoid bullets while shouting racial slurs is not the first thing that comes to mind so let s say you avoid the raining toxic pirates and actually win this hypothetical fight what do you get nothing nothing at all there is no reward other than continued existence and the salty tears of your enemies whenever someone attacks you you re risking everything while they probably risk nothing at all nowhere is safe you cannot avoid other players even if you seem to make friends and form an alliance to give them free loot they get an extra 50 of your sell value for no effort it takes literal seconds for them to sink your ship and take everything because 100 is better than 50 and they will because people in this game have no concept of honour it s a pirate game after all and in my playtime i ve had what i would consider a successful alliance exactly once and this doesn t even include people who are just for the sake of it you could be fishing doing tall tales on a solo sloop with a huge neon sign saying no loot here and you will still get attacked 50 of the time you see another player but it s a pirate game no pirates steal for profit if you do this you re just a terrible person who somehow derives pleasure from other people s pain and you seriously need to see a psychologist edit after safer seas the example doesn t work so well but my point still stands there is no downside to being a toxic in fact it is usually beneficial so instead of tense alliances where crews work together for a short time towards a shared goal and then either part ways or bring out the guns it s always better to just shoot first and ask questions never there is never a reason for teamwork because everything is possible solo if you throw enough respawns at it the only reason to have a ceasefire is to get in a better position to start shooting so what needs to change 1 rewards for killing antagonistic pirates if i spend time defending my loot i should get something out of it otherwise every sail i see on the horizon is just another waste of my time there needs to be some kind of bounty system where if someone else shoots first and i successfully defeat them i get paid it makes absolutely no sense that i have to continually risk my hours of work levelling emissary against people who just spawned and they re the only ones who can get anything out of the encounter 2 imo there needs to be a better parley ceasefire system than the current alliances it shouldn t stop people from shooting each other but in a kind of pirate code way severely disincentivise it maybe tie it into the bounty system from point 1 where if you break parley other pirates get rewards for killing you that way you end up with a risk reward situation where betrayal is still possible but you have to decide if the cost is worth it 3 never going to happen because too many people would cry about it but pirate combat needs an overhaul more punishing respawns to stop the endless suicide missions especially for larger crews less one shot one kill so that shooting first isn t the only viable option when you see another player looking at you blunderbuss when a ship is sunk there should be an immediate server migration otherwise you get angry players hunting you from beyond the grave and you just have to keep killing them over and over for no reward until they finally get lucky and kill you 4 there needs to be a reason for ships to work together whether willingly or with a finger on the trigger the whole time alliances are vestigial because there is never a need for them and 100 50 the game needs pve content that s actually hard enough that you may need more than one ship and no you need 5 people to summon the megalodon doesn t count look up artificial difficulty if you have trouble understanding why 5 there needs to be a way to play the overly grindy tall tales with no pvp at all and possibly throw some hunters call stuff in as well earning gold would be disabled i hate that spotting another player often adds half an hour or more to the repetitive storyline especially when the achievements make you play through it five times for some reason alternatively make them worth my while with actual rewards that might be worth fighting for edited after safer seas update i probably would have preferred other pvm stuff be disabled to keep pvp player counts up but it s definitely better than nothing i want good pvp not this janky torrent of expendable pirates i want tense briefly lived alliances where nobody trusts each other but still has to work together not meaningless loot increases i want to win fights by knowing i out fought my opponent not because my crew was more expendable or because i got the first shot off and things went downhill from there the game supposedly thrives on tension but it also completely removes any reason to ever trust other players all trust does is open you up for betrayal in turn the only meaningful interaction with other players is as obstacles the best way to survive is to run or to murder on sight instead of the ocean of player interaction that should be possible the only tension is that of wondering whether i ll have to run off the map to finally make my pursuers give up which by comparison is just plain boring
