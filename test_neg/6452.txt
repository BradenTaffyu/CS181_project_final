hello my lovely people i did not want to make a review on my lovely dead by daylight which i bought 1 year after it s release and had a lot of down time and then coming back and so on and on againwell i love it don t get me wrong the idea is good but here comes the but it s not very well done1 we always had a tunneling problem and have gotten borrowed time as basekit to balance it out all well and done but killers found a way to get rid of it and just tunnel regardless we got perks that help us but those get nerfed as soon as killers say it s too strong nerf it but when survivors say anything the killers get a buff instead huh 2 coordination issues when the game started it was impossible to get any info of what your other survivors do or if they get chased unless you were the obsession then everyone knew you got chased it s good they added the interaction markers or the chase barrier on all of the survivors but where do we put the line of it every game i play it s a all around no coordination fest you wanna go healing build well if you still want coordination get kindred into it but why do i have to use kindred to let other survivors know where they are at when i am hooked and then they still all come to the hook or none comes here comes problem 33 mmr system they added skillmatched matchmaking well no they actually did not in the past 6 months i gotten wins after wins and loses after loses why cause either the survivors were all first timers and had no idea and the killer is a comp player and knows everythingor you get a killer that has no clue and good survivors that stomp himwhere is the skillbased matchmaking in that if there was such a thing wouldn t we get balanced matches where every surv and killer was on the same level so yeah behavior lied to us about it multiple years ago and just try to hide the fact that they have no idea how to code it4 they wanna make the game easier by making you pay into good perks and killers but also they put killers out that need soooooo much coordination that in soloqueue you have no chance to get anything done cause everyone is skaddadeling around like a racoon on food hunt 5 why is it 95 of the day you get 100 bloodpoints on playing survivor welp that is because there is more killer players playing than survivors which means survivor is so unattractive to play that on the 5 of the time where killers get extra bloodpoints it s late at night so when friends join together to play for 1 2 matches and then after that it s back to survivors having 100 so make survivors more attractive than buffing killers non stop 6 i am a 95 survivor main and it just feels like playing hell if anyone is wondering this is purely from the survivor side and how it feels playing alonegame idea 9 10balancing from when game came out 8 10balancing 2024 4 10licenses 9 5 10fun with friends 10 10fun in soloqueue in 2024 3 10would i recommend it as a new player hell no play anything but this game when you are a new player
