i like the game i have enjoyed the gameplay and character building of the game however the drop rates are outright lies 10 drop rate and twenty five runs and nothing it s a run replacement to warframe since that game lost it s soul in asinine new games but i can t suggest others play it unless the damn devs make the drop rate and farming at least close to their claims
