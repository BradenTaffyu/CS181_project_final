2021 mmr ruined everything before rank only meant hours played in a rather roundabout way this didn t mean skill nor it was an indicator of how serious a player were just experience therefore you could find a very rich variety of players on high ranks people trying builds that could play just fine even if the build wasn t great sweaty players with ultra rares intent on winning no matter what people that are not that great but still put the time in and so on this meant matches on high ranks were still fun with players of all walks of life forming the teams or killing the teams now with mmr in place you ll always be put against the best people for your rank this means all matches are now serious sweatfests that force you to play in the most optimal way possible to ensure you ll get your goals noed brand new parts dh ds bt all the time etc means that you can no longer play for fun there is no longer grounds to test builds without losing rank that will just make it unfair for other players mmr doesn t take into account items so newbies can be carried by strong items and then find themselves losing continuously because they no longer have them killers that are less than meta are not worth playing mmr is killer dependant so why play unoptimal killers if it s not gonna earn you wins but you know what s worse the game adopted mmr to be more balanced balanced means there s a pretense of competitive and the problem with this game in particular is that you can t make a game competitive when it hasn t been clearly established what it means to win or to lose case in point i played a doctor match all survivors but one escaped but i maxed bp in every category except survival no pip i played a legion match just one survivor escaped 15 hooks no pip i played a plague match killed everyone two gens done maxed bp except one category no pip on survivor side i escaped after doing three gens i pipped then i ran the killer for three gens didn t get hooked and opened the exit no pips so what gives the game won t even show you if you ranked up or not on the mmr the leagues and bronze silver gold iridiscent leagues don t have anything to do with mmr it s just a medal system we don t know what counts for mmr developers have said it s more than just winning without saying what winning actually is we only know items and addons don t count for mmr which is already terrible this makes the gaming experience extremely unsatisfactory you feel like you re left in the dark after each match with the disappointing sensation that you never win you only don t lose and even then you can still very clearly lose what a sham
