2023 i haven t been this disappointed in a long time total war warhammer 3 was my beacon of hope for quality gaming this year but it quickly became my biggest letdown a strategic coup by creative assembly this game feels like less of a game and more of a gateway to an onslaught of excessively priced dlcs sitting before this glossy fa ade i realize i ve been taken for a fool the gaming landscape is barren unless you re willing to continuously pay hefty prices for the extra content akin to holding your game hostage ca s pr team then has the audacity to preach that the right to discuss is a privilege demonstrating a complete lack of respect for their community an absolute disregard of us the loyalists who helped to build the very foundation they re choosing to shake this was a rude awakening that auspicious reviews and sales are privileges that require the duty of respect towards the customers and delivery of quality products principles ca seems to have forgotten being a total war devotee for as long as i can remember it s disheartening to see ca turning the franchise into another object of corporate exploitation reminiscent of games workshop s methodology nostalgia in this case is a weak defense against such a despairing reality towards creative assembly and sega goodbye and no thank you a bond forged in the genesis era has now been severed the marriage of outrageously expensive dlcs and a tone deaf pr move are the final nails in your coffin for our relationship if this was merely an economic debate and ca had shown a shred of humility things could have been different but the condescending comments towards the players reek of arrogance solidifying their journey on the path of corporate deterioration it s like witnessing a titan fall sega and ca giants of gaming reduced to shadows of their former selves joining the disdainful annals alongside bethesda and blizzard as a form of protest i ve resorted back to rome 2 total war heavily modded to recapture the old magic a magic that s now buried deep under layers of greed and entitlement consider this a warning to my fellow gamers let s make a stand and not finance any more oblivious downfall for earning the privilege of sales and positive reviews sega and ca must first learn to value their greatest asset us the community
