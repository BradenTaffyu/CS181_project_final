2023 it was outstandingly enjoyable when i bought it in the summer of 2020 when i sailed with friends we usually had a good time sailing anywhere trying different quests and making a nice amount of gold when i sailed alone it was very relaxing and enjoyable to hunt fish or just hangout on my favorite island there were players of every type rude polite quiet new old it was a mixed bag i could handle accept and enjoy anything that was in the game as the seasons changed and new content arrived the tone of the game was changing my friends and i could feel it we had done hundreds of quests fought many ai raided strongholds we did everything we could we began to realize that many of the quest types were too similar go and fetch this item fight these enemies and deal with a skeleton ship every now and then we had overplayed many of the quests new and old and had bored ourselves with the repetition when new content arrived we were all excited and tried many of them the ghost ship fleets flameheart ashen winds any of the adventures again and again they never felt fun or challenging they were just a big time commitment most of the new events we only tried once because we would still feel bored a week after we did it the last thing we all did together was the first pirates life adventure it was at least an hour of gameplay and we left it feeling bored exhausted and annoyed when the adventure was over and we couldn t walk on our ship because we would phase through the floorboards we furiously uninstalled and left months later i felt the itch to play again because it still had a place in my heart there were so many good times had by myself or with friends and i had to give it another chance it was hurtful to see that sea of thieves was walking the same path as rainbow six siege warframe payday 2 and some of my other once beloved games an overabundance of content with varying levels of quality trying its best to keep you playing the game by adding new content i sailed back to my favorite island and took a good look at how things had changed many of the items i wanted to purchase with gold were absurdly expensive yet they were barely a recolor of something i already owned plunder passes filled with interesting items that i wasn t going to spend over a month grinding for the items of the first plunder pass had still not been added to the store despite reading that they would be over a year ago new quests and events that were still in essence the same as events we had when i first played the game in 2020 i knew sea of thieves was lost and that day i lost my love for it when the captaincy update came along i told my old friends and we gathered to take a look and see what the game was still turning into when i found out i couldn t use the word drunk in my ship s name it put a bad taste in all of our mouths we looked through all the ship cosmetics and their requirements and we weren t about to make that much of a commitment to one game that we didn t love anymore we uninstalled once again and now they try not to think about what horrid familiar and expensive shapes this game will take next while they continue to frown grumble and curse what this game has become and how it didn t deliver what exactly what they wanted i reminisce on the wonderful times that this game delivered to me all the fish i caught the outfits i made the islands with beauty i admired the gentle and sweet people i met and the great battles with skeletons or strangers on the sea i once loved every moment of it and it had earned a special place in my games library and my heart i won t forget what this game has given to me especially now that it gives nothing to me now it will continue down the path of content with commitment and i can t dedicate my time to a game that asks for so much of it i may reinstall in the coming years return to my island to reminisce once again help a new friend complete an adventure but my love for this game is gone it sails to new lands
