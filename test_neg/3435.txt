2015 2023 rockstar recently added a few vehicles and bikes that were exclusive to consoles which upset pc players now they have just removed 180 vehicles to sell back in their monthly subscription gta which isn t even available to pc players if that s not incompetence it s malice and i don t know which one is worse 2015 the online is fun with friends but i didn t think the amount of hackers everyone mentioned in their reviews were that accurate i thought probably an overexaggeration yeah it wasn t i would say 70 to 80 of online lobbies will contain one hacker that is spam killing everyone on the map at the same time i would recommend the game since i still have a lot of fun hanging out doing missions and driving my car around but the hackers really need to be sorted out before the review can be changed to positive
