2015 don t buy this game until rockstar gets off their asses and fixes the ridiculous amount of bugs they still haven t touched since launch the game takes 12 hours to download on a good machine and crashes ten or twenty minutes for no reason the online mode is full of hackers who kill everyone repeatedly and will even try to get you banned from the game by spawning you money i don t have access to half of the map because the game will crash if you drive too far north don t bother reporting any bugs to rockstar they have some of the worst customer service i ve ever seen take the crashes for example i ve seen hundreds of posts about this problem and rockstar either ignores them or tells the poster to buy a better computer this is obviously a huge problem that happens to many players and rockstar hasn t even touched it yet don t get me wrong this is a good game when it works a really good game but the fact that rockstar has ignored so many game breaking issues experienced by such a huge portion of their fanbase makes me think that rockstar just doesn t give two by the way nice thing you pulled with the summer sale rockstar
