2022 a well designed game with great art direction and polished feel of the movement system and bullet balistics it is a wonder how a game this good is ftp truly a worthy successor for the titanfall franshise however for the love of god don t play it hear out my frustration tears bugs servers the servers are laggy making the game unplayable at times much more often than you d imagine a ea sponsored game to be the last 2 months have been pure pain where playing ranked with lags like that is voluntarily de ranking yourself bugs related to the shop are fixed in seconds while other bugs take weeks to even get noticed by the devs a bug that casually adds the us english keyboard each time the application is launched makes re launching the game annoying at best this issue has been there since launch it is still in the game then there is being stuck in returning to lobby if you won a lottery of getting on a laggy server which makes relaunching the game the only solution bots and cheaters are a hard issue to deal with no doubt but now i see them even in non ranked lobbies prompting a question of just how many of these get through respawn s security systems the game is poorly optimized for weak or even average rigs i can not play the game without lags or stutters with gtx 1650 and amd ryzen 5 3600 on the lowest settings even launching apex through geforce experience optimization doesn t guarantee you won t have lags note that my rig is way beyond minimal settings if not hardware or bug related problems then server lags will make sure your gaming experience is not as intended by the dev team donation system lootboxes oh boy oh boy let s talk about it if you will want to invest money in the game to cheer up the devs despite everything you will find your wallet being bled dry the prices are 25 for a skin on average which feels completely ridiculous compared to any other life service game i ve played you will feel like a fool every time you buy a retexture of a base model for a price of an indie game the so called collection events time limited events to buy skins are their own special animal where you are invited to spend 130 to get a reskin for your character s melee aka an heirloom that exact melee that has been nerfed so hard during the latest update that you re better off using the weakest pistol in the game to deal with your enemies you basically pay 130 euro for something to be angry beyond comprehension when using it expect this to happen consistently because some skins obscure the view when scoping more than basic ones and some skins give you an advantage in that regard effectively making gun skins an unfair advantage or a paid for disadvantage devs gaslight their fanbase on social media into believeing the pricing is fair and necessary despite respawn being sponsored by ea who have all the money in the world skins almost always come with their price already reduced and later re sold by the devs with the original price being different from the starting one which is illegal in most countries speaking of illegal the game s main donation mechanic is lootbox based the pool of rewards is inflated with worthless trash with legend banners and sprays considered legendary and epic quality getting a legendary lootbox does not guarantee you a weapon character skin at all anymore a chance of getting something legendary is 7 by the way which sound like a lot but it isn t a chance of getting an heirloom the aformentioned melee reskin is 0 1 read unobtainable for an average player summary generally it is a wonderful game to play alone or with friends but the servers make it unbearable at times and if you will want to spend money to sweeten your experience at least a little bit then expect the game not respect your wallet at all i really want to recommend it but i can t do so without feeling guilty p s i criticize the game because i have played it for so long stop with the yet you participate in it curious i am very smart i want this game to be better but its flaws persist until it is up to standards i won t be able to recommend it
