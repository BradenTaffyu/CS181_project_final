2023 tldr good game ruined by rockstar s incessant need for money the latest update removed the ability to purchase almost 200 cars in the online mode many of which are in the base game the pc version of the game now does not receive updates the next gen version of the game does such as new cars and a mod shop these additional features would be completely applicable to pc without a decrease in performance luckily this also means the gta subscription model has not made it to pc with each gta online update is is clear rockstar do not cater to the player s experience anymore and instead are focussed on maximising their income before the next game i play the game on steam deck and the latest update has made it unplayable the game now instantly crashes on start and there are no fixes for this as of writing this is a issue that has occurred on previous updates i would recommend the game for the single player experience but i would strongly recommend against getting warped into online as you will quickly recognise rockstar s business model and how it constrains the player s experience
