2019 i loved this game i played it until they made it pretty much paid to win i bought the game for the multiplayer so i m focusing on that if you would buy this game for the singleplayer go do it singleplayer is great i am not a guy that buys game for singleplayer but i did enjoy this campaign if you are prepared to buy a game and be welcomed to 10 high level players that oneshot you this is your game if you have 3 friends to start this adventure with you make a private session and you will have the fun of your life if you don t have friends don t buy this game i loved this game now i kinda hate it edit lmao every lobbby has atleast 2 modders now it s even worse
