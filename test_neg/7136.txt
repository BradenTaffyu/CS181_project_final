2015 tl dr wait for performance updates or buy console version low fps poor optimization do not buy if you are looking for a stable game stuff like if you alt tab you get put into windowed mode everysingle time you have to see the opening cinematic every time you start the game and there is no getting around it overall ported horrible for pc hopefully updates are coming worst cod launch ever update 18 november performance updates and bug fixes 14 november still doing a terrible job with the pc port and only small things are fixed mostly compatibility with bad computers also when we are at it we can add some other problems to the list you have lost connection to the host in a singleplayer offline game fps is still dropping from 100 to below 30 still can t alt tab without going into windowed mode and risk getting the game capped at 30 fps fixed servers are still lagging just as much as they did the first week all love to the cod games but if you are going to buy this for the love of god spend your cash on a console version
