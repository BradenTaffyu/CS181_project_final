unfortunately due to the nature of time gating and rapid wipe cycles 6 week per server i cannot recommend the game the amount of content available on a per week basis is far too light to promote long term play and the content unlocked on subsequent weeks doesn t add enough to keep a healthy gameplay flow on top of this the cosmetics you unlock the blueprints you gain and any real money purchases you choose to make will be locked per character as nothing is account bound you cannot delete a character and you cannot transfer a character to a different world either addition with phase 3 hard prime wars are introduced with a heavy restriction that is not made clear to the player about obtaining frontier pass in order to obtain the pass you must get 1000 score in other prime wars the only surefire way to get that score is build a bunch of small wooden fences in a circle addition to this as of now people spam the missiles before anybody else has a chance to contribute so only a few people pass this threshold
