played originally on xbox and switched to steam when a friend got it for me this game would be in my top games if they hadn t made toxic players their only customer base instead of opening it up to non pvp players like i hoped with safer seas instead they took out most off the game locking everything behind high seas and handing you a shell off a game expecting you to be happy with it in the new safer seas you can t do a lot off the events such as the fort of fortune you are unable to own or captain a ship though you can still customize the ship you use some of the milestones are locked behind being on a captained ship so you are unable to make progress on those which is a bummer the reputation gain is capped at 40 and you cant be emissaries for any off the factions any pvp factions you can make no progress on in general which is understandable the gold and reputation earned is set to 30 of normal and the chests you can find are set to some of the lowest ones over all safer seas is not worth playing at all even for beginners just go through the tutorial mission all that has come of safer seas is that it has given already incredibly toxic players another reason to be more toxic citing if they didn t want pvp they would go back to safer seas i hope that the developers don t use the joke that is safer seas as a statistic to back up their ideas that people don t like the non pvp version so that they don t have to keep offering it i would be willing to spend more time and money on a game that catered to the wants of a large group of people that don t want to have to deal with pvp when being a pirate but still want a good game
