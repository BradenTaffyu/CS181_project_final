the game in and of itself is fun lots to do and pretty scary when you first start its solely the developers who are pure trash power trippers i had a game ban applied to my account for voice chat trash talking that s it they perma banned me from the game and requested a game ban on my steam account which makes me look like i cheated in the game you have speed hackers running rampant people flying through the sky and insta kill across the map killers receiving 0 punishment but telling some one they suck at the game who actually did suck gets you perma banned typical trash company cares more about hurt feelings than the integrity of their game try to appeal the bans and you receive automatic bot responses from garbage low tier devs who do nothing all day you got survivors griefing you on hook and teaming with their friends as killers which will never receive bans don t tell some one they suck though hope this game goes up in flames and all you devs are out of a job and never work on any project again
