2023 it would be a fun game if you didn t have to constantly play against people levels above you recommended for people that love losing 100s of games untill the game mercifully decides to put you into a lobby with people who are below your skill level and can barely move and shoot at once i literally do not understand why is it so difficult to make a balanced and fair experience the matchmaking has been the same for years even though they promised to fix it correct me if i m wrong i didn t follow the game development much throughout these last years based on the reviews it seems like majority of playerbase is ok with all of this the fanboys will keep buying the skins that cost 1 5th of a minimum wage untill ea can puke out another half assed game that ll get mixed reviews the golden age of gaming
