2015 can t play the game edit may 4th 2015still can t play the game edit may 11th 2015can play the gamethe game seems to rely on a dll file to run the game doesn t provide said dll and no matter how many times i reinstalled directx said dll was never installed this youtube helped fix the problem youtube video gta v 0xc000007b error fix views 93 437 dl gta 5 0xc000007b fix this changes nothing by the way the amount of garbage i went through to get gta v to work was absolutely unnacceptable and then i had a freaking saint help me and they did even more crap to make it work with zero yield so my review is still negative until i get the hours back spent on fixing the game before i got it working this is all the i did in vain i have a perfectly adequate machine which i have built myself with a core i7 16gb of ram windows 7 r9 285 amd and i can t open the game no matter what i do before i hear some smarmy child tell me what i should do or what i did wrong here is a list of i have already done verified the integrity of the cache updated my graphics drivers updated visual c redist updated directx launched the game as administrator launched their rockstar social club bs launcher as administrator deleted their rockstar social club launcher and verified again updated my graphics drivers to the beta drivers verified the integrity of the cache updated windows tried some dubious ini files which might fix this pos game or might give me a virus disabled gpu and run intel only disable windows firewall because why not did i mention i verified the integrity of the cache oh yeah and i posted a ticket to rockster support and have received no response as well as received no response ranging to snarky unhelpful responses from the steam forums update i did hear from rockstar support about a day and a half after i posted the ticket and after i called them out on twitter and here is a list of things they have told me to do which has also not worked can you effing believe they told me to verify the integrity of the cache i m dead serious send them a launcher log file which doesn t exist located in a folder which doesn t exist disable my firewall or switch firewalls really open an executable they sent me probably the biggest ray of hope i had was when they sent me the exe which were very quickly dashed when i opened it and i gave me a sorry grand theft auto is not installed on this machine please reinstall messagei can most assuredly say without a doubt that gta v is installed on my machine but hey at least rockstar patched out mod support but wait if you can t even open the game how is you have 5 minutes of play from repeatedly opening it and watching it crash i generated the 5 minutes of play required to write this review why because i am that pissed off i am that mad after all the nonsense i heard about rockstar doing a good port of this game from different new sites from different users from different reviews the game just doesn t work maybe it s something real easy something real simple but if that s the case then that represents how much rockster screwed up people need to know you need to know before you buy this game that there is a chance that it just may not work regardless of your machine and regardless of what you do the game is still broken i may amend this review if rockstar fixes the problem but honestly i don t know how good the game would have to be to undo the amount of bs i ve been put through tl dr don t take the risk
