2016 if you like to waste money this is the game for you i ve got over 500 hours in this game i loved it enough to spend an extra 100 on in game money recently shortly afterwards i was banned due to a hacker in the lobby during my uncomfortably common wrongful ban rockstar had reset my in game currency literally robbing me of the money i had just purchased directly from them worst company i have ever dealt with and will not be putting any more of my money in their pockets edit well i finally got my gta back after calling customer support spent a couple hours in game spending my money on mc businesses and running a single free roam mission which was disrupted and taken over by modders hackers with teleport godmode and explosive ammo i tried swapping lobbies and was met with a permanent ban notice and with rockstar s new ban policy i cannot appeal and nobody can appeal a ban whether it was false positive or not game is over can t believe they ceased developement of gtavi to keep this sinking ship polished
