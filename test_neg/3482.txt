2021 tldr if you re buying this game buy it for the story mode online isn t worth it pros good graphics decent performance story is fairly fun and varied has many in depth aspects character clothing customization vehicle customization businesses etc multiplayer is fun to an extent cons multiplayer plagued by cheaters playerbase highly toxic multiplayer poorly moderated in general if at all intransparent and insufficient rule enforcement requires you to be online to start the game even for story mode yet another game that force installs their own launcher for no reason horrible load times especially for multiplayer although they have improved multiplayer unstable in general random disconnects and crashes the pause menu is not easy to use with mouse keyboard and laggy
