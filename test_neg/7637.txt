2023 legitimately fun game if a bit shallow repetitive but absolutely ruined by the huge incentive for players to just be jerks but if you enjoy the game play loop simple cosmetic achievement based progression it can absolutely be fun until your ship is sunk you lose everything you spent hours of your time gaining if you care about earning gold progressing the game by buying new cosmetics increasing your reputation you will care when that gold is stolen hours of your time is wasted this is what made me quit if you don t care about cosmetics and earning reputation to play more of the same type of repetitive missions there s no point in playing actually playing the game is slow ships move slow players walk swim slow combat is slow and the only things to do are earn gold for more cosmetics or attack other players for their gold to buy cosmetics or just to be a jerk surely you can just choose to avoid pvp or avoid other players not really the map is small enough that you will run in to other players frequently and there s plenty of players that are only looking to attack other players there is a match making mode hourglass fights to participate in pvp against other players who want to play pvp however this is not the game s primary pvp you can also simply join the main game attack other players with no downsides there is no in game police that will chase player killers or shops that won t buy stolen goods everyone is incentivized to kill you at any time and they ll be rewarded for it with your hard earned loot what is the point spending multiple hours getting a few hundred thousand gold worth of treasure when you can simply kill everyone on the server and take the treasure they spent hours earning pvp players have no risk the only thing to lose is the tiny bit of money spent on cannonballs wood food yet they have a massive incentive to attack other players since they can get hours worth of loot in 20 minutes and if they sink they just try again if you enjoy doing anything other than pvp you re always at a disadvantage against people who want to do pvp and this seems intended by the devs want to play solo too bad every other ship is faster than you much more capable of destroying you than you are of defending yourself or fleeing since the vast majority of players have at least 1 friend playing with them sure your sloop is more maneuverable than a brig or galleon but good luck out maneuvering them on the open ocean especially without anyone to help repair your ship while you steer want to do world events or even just pve voyages gold hoarders order of souls merchants etc too bad even though these are the most inherent basic ways to just play the game all of these draw attention to yourself leave your ship vulnerable while you carry them out there s a very good chance of your ship being sunk looted while you re on an island or fighting ghost fleets want to do tall tales too bad even with 0 loot onboard your ship the vast majority of other players want to kill you and or sink your ship on sight you can try to out run them possibly for over an hour the game always takes a long time to play most people playing are younger with multiple hours to dedicate even just to harassing others or try to sneak onto the island progress turn in the tall tale which for me has always resulted in me dying losing all progress on that tall tale since checkpoints are exceptionally rare in the open world tall tales additionally you frequently have to turn items in at specific outposts so if there s another player at that island you now have to risk dying or simply sail around the map for 30 60 minutes hope they leave and that you don t get killed by someone else while waiting trying to flee from an enemy player s ship too bad there s an extremely high chance of random events attacking you such as skeleton ships and the kraken or megalodon which only slows you down helps the pvp players since they don t mind waiting for the random events to sink you you d think well the random events could spawn on the enemy ships too you re right but multiple things make random events less lethal for players looking for pvp they re almost always better equipped for combat repairing their ship than you since they chose to begin attacking other players they re much more able to take damage to their ship since it doesn t matter if they slow down or go off course to fix it if you do that they catch up kill you they can afford to simply sail away come back later if their ship is ever in actual danger since no one is chasing them the fact that players can be 1 shot by a blunderbuss means if you re outnumbered you always lose all but 1 enemy players jump onto your boat kill you while dropping your anchor raising sails lighting fires while the other player moves their ship away from your cannons leaving their ship 100 safe and allowing the enemy players to re spawn infinitely if you manage to kill the enemy player s onboard your ship they just spawn come right back since it takes only a few seconds for them to drop your anchor masts yet significantly longer to un do these actions it s nearly impossible to escape once they ve boarded your ship they ll just stand in a spot where you can t blunderbuss them and shoot you the instant you get close have fun re spawning 10 times while your ship sinks more and more all game mechanics are heavily focused towards slowing down your play changes in wind direction random events like fog storms pve attacks and the massive distance between everything both in the ocean on foot which makes sense for a game with extremely shallow progression yet this also plays in favor of pvp players since they don t have to run around on islands or swim down to mermaid caves better yet they can just sink your ship while you do all that slow tedious stuff there s also constant server performance issues but it s barely worth mentioning compared to the game mechanics purposefully chosen by the devs the team is slow to push updates both feature updates bug fixes if you have performance issues now you re basically guaranteed to still have them 3 weeks from now hope you aren t looking forward to the next feature update it s almost always going to be less than what they promised filled with bugs tl drthis game could be fun if it was either filled with slow tedious game mechanics to slow down your progression in order to make the game seem larger longeror massively incentivizing rewarding killing other playerswith the game doing both it just takes forever then you die and lose all your stuff not fun not worth it
