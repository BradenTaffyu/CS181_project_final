i like how the game feels the gun play and the characters but i cannot recommend it after the first area you notice right away that there is no diversity and it pretty much repeat the same type of gameplay just in a different environment layers and layers of low rng 3 20 for each part to waste as much of your time as possible so you might end up buying their overpriced microtransactions i wouldn t mind spending money on the characters but charging 100 for one ultimate character and a few bits and pieces is a bit much since it is a free to play game i don t mind at all spending money to support the game if the prices are reasonable i will change my review if they make changes to the drop rates or prices
