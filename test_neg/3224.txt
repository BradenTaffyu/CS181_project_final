2016 my experience with rockstar support well as you may pick up from the title anybody posting about experience with support is most likely posting something negative this is most definitely true i begin my story 2 days ago playing gta 5 online and having some fun with friends since i m slightly impatient i decided to purchase a 10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up purchased some weapons vehicle upgrades all that jazz the next day i start up the game only to see that i have been banned with no explanation as to why i have been banned of course i move onto the support website i submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket i was impressed such fast response times just kidding it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can t do anything about it so then i decided to call 51 calls just to get into the waiting line 47 minute hold brief explanation of myself and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same the automated system on the website told me i still have no idea as to why i was banned never hacked never modded never abused anybody thank you support for literally wasting my time other than the stupid banning of innocent people including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one it s fun with friends verdict would i recommend it if you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system sure i would but i can t say that is possible ijustneededtovent endrantedit this was originally a reddit post when i state 2 days ago i really mean a while ago edit 2 to all those saying just shut up you cheated admit it stop lying you clearly either haven t played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false positives seriously
