2021 used to be better but now it s rife with obvious sjw influenced operators and even more absurd gadgets it slowly moved from a swat aesthetic game focused on realism into a colourful overwatch style pro league focused game where trendy unrealistic operators are put in every new release the overall shift wasn t so bad in year 2 or 3 but it s just become more and more tiresome competitive play is now limited to only bomb because the devs are lazy and inept at balancing maps having other game modes in comp wasn t a problem for years current devs are just worse at reasonably balancing maps compared to old devs especially with all the messy operator gadget bloat they have shoved in the game it was more fun and there was increased variety when comp had more game modes completely removing them was a lazy cop out that has lessened the experience this is what happens when devs only care and pander to pro league while ignoring most of their playerbase the overall experience has gotten worse it s just not the same game anymore
