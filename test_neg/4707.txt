2022 comments off because i know the community edit how come when i shoot someone it s like i ve opened up a box of captain dunce oops all hitmarkers and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of times it just erases my existence i just cannot have fun on here even as a team anymore with the sbmm and eomm i get punished immediately if i do slightly good in a match by being thrown in matches with people that just on me the entire time people complain that movement is slow and terrible but it s not if it was then explain why sliding and shooting around corners or jumping and shooting is the strategy movement is still super fast and stupid just like before shields and knives are near impossible to counter their feet are covered can t flank because they will rush and kill you can t throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you thanks all i want is to jump into matches and have fun no not just stomp everyone that s not fun i want to have fun i want varied lobbies showing that people aren t just bots it doesn t help that the aim assist actually tracks for you with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not if your aim starts to move on it s own you just aim and fire and you re gonna get the kill i position myself better and shoot first doesn t matter enemy moves around causing me to have to manually track them with my mouse and eyes while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake while they can just slightly tilt r stick down and fire flinch damn right that i do but when you have aim assist the tracking pretty much counters it there s nothing fun about it i am only playing it for fear of missing out and since i already bought the damn thing the campaign was fun but that alone isn t worth what i paid i am not ok and this game is making worse it is infuriating by design i can t even get good games anymore what is the new good for me is if i am close to breaking even before i could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where i actually do good now it s just getting wrecked at spawn or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has uav that works through ghost or i shoot someone first hit them twice and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist
