2021 it is not worthy to buy it hot garbage as some might say game is a melee oriented battle royale set in chinese culture just because combat is mostly focused on melee weapons you still have a few ranged options to chose from as well if you die you die because you can t play melee you won t get sniped by hanzo or widowmaker from 300m just because someone plays sniper rifles for 9000h in fps game is not easy and somewhat foggy about what should i do to not die to some korean player with spear there are a few tutorials in game but they are pretty basic enough to play against bots but not enough to play against players all weapons have their own combos every character have their own skills some are straight useless in most cases but generally everything is playabe i ll try to summarize pros and cons in easy form there are quite a lot of people on every server so it shouldn t be a problem to find ranked game unless you play when gamers amount is decreasing then queue time is getting noticeably longer game has nice but repetative vibe graphics sounds multi language dubbing lines animations games are not that long i think they end at around 25th minute at most there are some waifu and rule34 materials wink there is build in voice chat in game on top of normal text chat you can play with up to 2 friends since lobby is capped at 3 players there are few game modes on top of normal game you should use ssd drive to play hdd will make your game freeze quite often and it is crucial to be freeze less to stay alive battle pass costs almost as much as base game it offers both free and paid tiers of course but you probably experienced in other games that difference between free and paid is visible but free to play games like narka has to make money too right there are quite a lot of quests daily weekly seasonal character specific not like this is bad by itself but you almost exclusively gain in game currency from quests you can t grind them by just playing this is to slow progress of gaining skins and push you to paying with real money for them you ll open chests rather rarely this is bad because your customization progress will be slow if you won t invest real money in gambling boxes and feeling of expanding wardrobe is non existant comparing to overwatch where you get chest every account level or after doing some quests here you get chests from battlepass character quests so like 2 3 per character and you can buy them with hard cap 4 week game is made on unity engine and has its own anti cheat that is kinda garbage game is flooded with cheaters script macro users game is not pay to win you can upgrade weapons only in match with lootable glyphs everybody can do that and it is part of gameplay there is no crafting system but it does have lootboxes with skins a bit like overwatch skins are quite expensive for free to play players the most expensive costs 98000 silk and i have like 30k after 70h in game so your best bet is to get them from chest not every skin is chestable some are exclusive to battle pass or promo codes gambling to change nickname in game you need to pay with paid or grindable currency game is absolutely the purest form of tryharding that exists recommended only for players that enjoy sweatin to the limits it is fun when you are good but it will take time to get to that level if you don t have background in frame perfect games like tekken note battlepass costs either 1360 or 4360 gold all premium tiers if you unlock them will give you only 1280 gold back so here goes your money you either buy more to sustain battle pass for few seasons or be forced to buy some gold every 3 months gold packages available in store 240g 1 851200g 9 253000g 23 15 1 lootbox 6000g 46 25 3 lootbox 12000g 92 5 10 lootbox only thing that hurts me personally about this game is cashgrabs and gambling taken straight from mobile games on top of paying 20 for game that is far from perfect battle pass gambling boxes paid exclusive skins and maybe more in the future don t buy it it is a hot garbage and twitch audience is already dying in eu na i doubt this game will bloom but might wither for few years being populated by pros who can t play other games and cheaters don t make same mistake as i did but if you think this is suitable enviroment for you you can use my reference code in game chdkdkxqhr
