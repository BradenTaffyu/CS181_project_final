2023 played previous versions of cod and warzone did fairly well on pc mouse this current game is unbalanced with the aim assist given to controller users you can not disable crossplay to even this out if you did decent as a pc player on this game before you will get your ass kicked most of the time in this version maybe they will fix it but probably not since they already have our money and put out a broke ass game
