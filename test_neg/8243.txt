2019 early access review the game is everything that is advertised a great physics sandbox but after level 3 it turns into a very hectic bullet hell shooter and the fun of methodically interacting with the physics is pushed away because there is no time to pay attention to anything except for dodging enemies if they could tone down the bullet hell part so it does not get in the way of the main feature experimenting with physics then it would be one of the best physics based games in the last few years the game can still be hard at lower levels but the difficulty should be created from enemies slowly wearing the player down or cornering him so there is time to interact with the environment i like physics based games but i do not like bullet hell games difficulty should not be attached to speed of gameplay it should keep the pacing of the upper levels but make the enemies harder to kill without making their projectiles harder to dodge
