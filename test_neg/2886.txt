2020 this is one of the best games ever made and i m absolutely addicted to it but it doesn t deserve a positive review no i m not referring to campaign i m exclusively speaking about online i won t even write everything i think i ll just say this game is addictive as hell with the right people but the problem is that finding the right people in this game is like finding a needle in a haystack it s just hell the game is riddled with modders that always want to mess with everyone and it s a real pain if you want to mod for money go for it everything in this game is disgustingly overpriced and the payouts for things are garbage making money in the game is easier than ever but the problem is it takes too long and the payout ratio when compared with the prices of items is just ridiculous not everyone has the time to grind for days just to afford one super car or whatever they want to indulge in but when you mod in order to mess with other people s gameplay and hard work e g cargo you re just a worthless scumbag the sad thing is that rockstar don t do anything about it this has been a serious issue for years they don t seem to do much about the modder infestation and it s sad to acknowledge because this game is so amazing do i recommend it unlike what my review states yes i do it s fun and if you have friends it s even better but it doesn t deserve a positive review until rockstar show they care about their community it s that simple
