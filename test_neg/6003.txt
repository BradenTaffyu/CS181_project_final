2020 i love this game so so much and i m not going to stop playing it for a long while butthe community is extremely abrasive to new players and there is so much you have to learn and unlock this game is a huge time investment for it to ever be remotely good i may have hit that sweet spot where i know enough about the game for it to be fun for me but i can t say i recommend this to everyone you have to really be willing to put in the time and effort as well as deal with probably the most toxic community in any online game i ve ever played yes even worse than league of legends
