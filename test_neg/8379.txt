2022 after beating the game a few times i ve come to the realization this game is too inconsistent to be considered a good game the amount of patience needed to have a good run is absurd for how quickly and unforgivingly this game can just instantly ruin all of it and 80 of the time you won t have a good run anyways since you ll just consistently get tier spells wands and modifiers that won t even mix well then the fact you need to be at a holy mountain or otherwise have a perk to edit wands is the stupidest ever if you do manage to make a good wand and all that it becomes how long will i be able to survive before i get one shot by something completely random and out of my control rogue legacy dead cells gungeon binding of issac risk of rain monsoon slay the spire and even 20xx are far better rogue likes even at their hardest difficulties since at least you can work with bad rng in those while in noita it s literally just going to erase you and make you restart the grind again good run or not i m aware there are good players who have insane patience and are willing to wait 20 or more min camping on a rock waiting for enemies to kill each other or die of random hazards or spells they re throwing down at them that s not an exaggeration pro s will literally camp on a rock for 20 straight min game is fun sometimes when you get something good going but reflecting on my overall experiences i feel like there s more frustration and bad vibes with this game than there are the few good ones when you get something decent going also the community from what i ve seen just likes sucking this game off saying it requires patience and just keep trying but i wouldn t recommend listening to that i wasn t able to beat the game til about 80 hours of playtime after which i just wanted to find other bosses and hidden things but it s so terribly boring and tedious and it doesn t feel like there s an actual point i just can t be bothered anymore
