2019 update was on 5 mins and this guy tried to ddos me luckily i use a vpn and the idiot got the wrong info will never play another rockstar game online the lack of security is rediculous the game is great as most people already know but modders are and have been destroying the online community for a while some can be fun and are not terrible but when you get modders locking you in cages or teleporting everyone and then killing them over and over that is only fun for modders until rockstar decides to actually care it can be impossible for new players to get anything done online came back a couple of months later same thing modders killing people for no reason while on god mode sad that they do no notice the bad impact this is having on the game
