been playing since 1 6 on multiple accounts and all i can say is valve is losing everything servers ingame browser casual dm matches is just bots farming skins and cases premier cheaters impossible to rank up even matchmaking got alot of cheaters and valve does nothing its really sad to see grew up with counter strike games wish they would add back csgo as an option like with 1 6 source nexus in premier for example at 10 000 rating you will start encountering brand new accounts who don t even try and hide cheats 15 000 is worse more cheaters 25 000 is 5v5 hack vs hack valves servers are now owned by cheaters anyone thats legit and want to play the game has to play like faceit or any other third party software atleast they have an anti cheat i mean they could have keept the support for valve csgo servers up in the meanwhile might go back to 1 6 letsgoplay1 6instead f cs2 shetvalve
