2018 literally pay to win these days with overpowered high priced vehicles like oppressor mkii and expensive shark cards it s a really fun game but rockstar is doing everything in their power to make it less so giving griefers more tools with every update and making it harder and harder to make money the legitimate way pay for shark cards or get yourself a modder friend to give you some cash otherwise you won t enjoy gta online because the prices for everything are ridiculous by now which of course is intentional because they want you to pay real money for their ridiculously overpriced shark cards
