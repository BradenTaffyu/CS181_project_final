2021 this will be a very long review highlighting all the issues with apex what are the issues 1 the serversi always jokingly say servers ordered on wish because i don t know one single other multiplayer game that runs on 20 tick rate servers this results in you getting shot when you re already around a corner or when you already closed a door but still the shot magically goes through the door this is even worse when the ridiculously low tickrate gets paired with high ping which you will get pretty frequently at least as an advanced player because sbmm drags you across servers which results in you selecting i e frankfurt 2 15ms but once you re in the game you have a 90ms ping it is unbelievable how one of the biggest game publishers keeps a game so big on such a terrible infrastructure apex generated 500 million dollars of revenue in 2020 and ea plans on doubling this to 1 billion dollar yet they keep the servers on the crap end because it isn t ea s 1 cashcow it is pathetic and shows why ea truly is the worst publisher that deservs to be hated by everyone 2 sbmmsbmm or skill based matchmaking is a thing in apex personally i don t even have a problem with that and as someone who almost has 10k kills on wraith i personally preferred getting matched with master and pred sweats than to stomp some level 40 noob however apex sbmm doesn t simply match you with similarly skilled players an apex legends pro by the name of bowswer revealed how it actually works it gives you a few good games and after that when you play with randoms at least it pairs you with worse players also due for a loss on purpose while matching you against higher skilled players so to anyone who has some experience with this game if you ever wondered why your randoms are level 50 garbage with maybe 30 kills while your champion squad is a triple stacking master squad rocking a 20 bomb 4k badge triple triple badge or whatnot now you know why this happens you can read the article for yourself just search for apex pro player reveals how sbmm doesn t match players based on skill level it s an article from the website gameriv they also linked the thesis paper that ea has on the engagement optimized matchmaking framework personally i think apex sbmm goes even further this is unproven territory tho just my personal assumption based on 2400hrs of total playtime if i include smurfs to the point where it alters the loot you get again pretty much every advanced player knows these game sessions where you get some great rounds at the beginning and all of a sudden after some decent games you re suddenly struggeling to find any decent loot you run across half the map but you just can t find anything better than an alternator and a havoc without turbocharger heal items like cells syringes batteries medkits or pheoenix kits seem to almost not exist in this particular match or least not for you cause whenever you encounter enemies they always shoot at you with r301 s or volts 3 the legend metamy issue with the legend meta is how legends are being held to completely different standards in both their abilities and the buff cycles legends like gibby got buffed again and again in i think it was season 5 to the point where 95 of the playerbase said he was op also basically everyone made jokes about even further buffs eventually respawn realized and they nerfed him a tiny bit by reducing his arm shield hp from 75 to 50hp meanwhile other legends like mirage and octane had been waiting for some buffs since the beginning of the game they eventually got some buffs in season 6 and following but only with the season 8 buffs i d say that they are finally good legends like bangalore have not really seen any real buff even though she is only mediocre at best they did buff her ult a little by making it explode faster but that s it meanwhile legends like horizon entered the game incredibly op as a result she very quickly skyrocketed to the top of the winrate in season 7 as far as i know she is still 1 i won t explain the multitude of unique and unfair advantages that she has but in short she is the smallest legend now that wraith s hitbox got sized up by 15 yet she doesn t have low profile she s almost impossible to hit in her gravity lift cause she can a d strafe quickly while being 30m up in the air you can shoot a horizon low and all she has to do is make her gravity lift and she is basically guaranteed to get a battery through her tactical and her landing both have no sound before the nerf wraith was the legend with the smallest hitbox horizon s hitbox was just 5 bigger back then but she didn t have and still doesn t have low profile and while that was is the case for her while she also in 1 in winrate the devs did not see any need for a nerf instead they decided to nerf wraith for the 5th or 6th time even though she had already dropped to 2 and she had low profile while being basically equal in size no matter how you feel about a legend completely objectively speaking this is entirely unreasonable it is also unreasonable when you compare horizon s tactical cooldown 15s with the cooldown of other legends lobas crappy bracelet has 30s wraith s phasing has 25s even though horizon s q is definitely stronger than both the point about this is not to rant about certain legends if you still want to see it that way feel free to do so i can t do more than talk the point is to explain illustrate the highly unreasonable and illogical and therefore frustrating buff nerf attitude that respawn has towards its legends caustic has finally received a nerf a pretty massive one actually but i d say contrary to what caustic mains say they did not break him i still avoid gas it still causes big trouble it just won t kill you in 10s when you have full hp but even with the recent changes which are actually decent you still shouldn t expect reasonable and equally spread out legend balancing 4 soundthe sound of apex is the no reg of cs go it s not like it will happen with every 2nd enemy in every game but it will happen frequently enough in order to get frustrating gems are the silent devo back in season 5 or season 6 and a classic that has persisted through the game no footsteps if you ever get frustrated cause an entire squad came sprinting up to you and they all shredded you from behind all i can say is welcome to apex legends ladies and gentlemen imo it has gotten even worse after the 09th march update 5 the consistent ignorance about player demands obviously when a game has millions of players you can t cater to all demands however there have been some requests that are voiced quite frequently by the community but still these fatures have yet to find their way into the game a few examples are the introduction of a kill cam a top 3 system for legends the idea is to mark 3 legends as your 1 2 and 3 favourite a random picks your 1 favourite legend and you re afk no problem the game automatically picks your 2 favourite solosdespite popular demand the devs will simply not implement these fatures even though some are super simple to do which is insanely frustrating solos is especially frustrating soooo many players want solos but the devs seem to have almost some fundamentally religious opposition towards it they don t even test it you know instead of at least trying it out they keep up this no we will not implement solos attitude but they implemented no fill which allows you to play solo against trio and duo squads makes sense that concludes my review i kept it as neutral as possible
