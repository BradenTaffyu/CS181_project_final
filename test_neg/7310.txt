edit they addressed the issues i was concerned with all that s left is for game performance to be at a good level then i ll change this to a thumbs up as for the game its itself story 6 10 8 10 if you go for and complete the true ending you also get a different cutscene if you finish it when your main pawn has high affinity gameplay 10 10 the games has the bones to be something truly great but falls short in some areas the fact that new game plus doesn t scale with you is a damn shame however if you are a completionist there s a lot to keep you busy overall rating 7 5 10 needs endgame dlc original review below the game itself is fantastic it has everything you could ever want if you ve enjoyed the original dragons dogma so why a thumbs down it runs like ass and its single save you need a good pc to run it well consistently people are absolutely overreacting with the micro transactions they are tame and inconsequential as almost everything can be earned in game and easily too so buying them makes you an idiot it gives me headaches to see other games with similar mtx tame easily ignorable get praised to the high moon like monster hunter world resident evil 4 devil may cry 5 yet this game gets on for it if you re gonna push back on the mtx which is absolutely okay at least be consistent with the movement with every game past present or future otherwise you re being a hypocrite with double standards and doing absolute all to get companies to understand what is unacceptable or not the only micro transaction that is seriously questionable is the 2 character editor if you don t like the way your character looks you re out of luck because you can t make another save file or make another character the 2 character editor itself is inconsequential you can get it in game however the 2 editor in combination with only having one save file is an absolute scumbag move not being allowed a quick redo or make another character via another new game save file is depressing that said if you have a good pc or don t mind fps drops don t mind having a single save or don t even care about mtx then by all means go ahead and enjoy underneath all the scummy business decisions and optimization is a genuinely good game i have long past the refund window but i have a decent enough pc so i might as well just enjoy this absolute gem covered in mud however those on the fence should just wait a bit until capcom fixes the optimization and single save bs then this game would be an 100 easy recommend without a shadow of a doubt it is situations like this where i wish there was a sideways thumb or conditional recommendation option why hasn t steam added something like this is a mystery to me
