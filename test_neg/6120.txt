i started playing this game about 6 years ago mostly on xbox and some on steam the current state of the game is the worst it has ever been camping and tunneling are two terms that everyone in the community should be very familiar with and it is also overwhelmingly present in matches lately i read a comment once about this game and it still rings true to this day the game is designed in a way that if one side is having fun then the other side is not the developers at behavior are some of the worst devs i have ever seen for a video game almost 8 years and their game only gets worse over time instead of fixing broken mechanics they would rather release new skins and new characters the devs are completely out of touch with the player base and rarely listen to complaints that need to be looked into this game is no longer worth my time or your time until the current state gets some needed attention do not waste your money or your time there are better games with better communities and better devs this game sucks plain and simple
