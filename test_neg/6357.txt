2022 dead by daylight itself is a great game sometimes even exceptional it has its issues like any multiplayer title but overall it is more than worth playing however behaviour interactive are a company clearly more concerned with appearing politically correct than genuinely improving their game and the experience of those who play it bar the vocal minority who complain over such matters as offensive content for example this is what prompted my original review back in 2022 the developers decided to remove leatherface s claudette mask due to it supposedly acting as a tool for racism even going so far as to claim it is akin to blackface behaviour has a very clear political and social agenda which they make absolutely no effort to hide and it does not represent their playerbase time finances and resources put into their social pandering could be much better spent improving upon the variety of issues still present within the game overall rating dead by daylight 88 100 behaviour interactive 13 100
