2021 i honestly can t recommend this game the way it is right now i has a ton of potential but with such a hateful community and no easy way to report abuse griefing cheating etc i also can t really expect new players to pay good money for a game that does such a bad job on boarding people i feel like a lot of people will buy this game and enjoy it for a few hours before inevitably running into a scenario that ruins the game for them but by then you ve already spent your money so long story short the devs need to find a better way to build a better community before i consider suggesting this game to anyone
