2023 edit what i wrote below about the dlc pricing is still true but right now there is a bigger issue with the game performance everyone complains about the poor optimisation and since the latest update it s hit a point where i don t even want to play wh3 anymore i no longer consider this game an upgrade and now just really recommend just sticking with wh2 i wish i had if you liked the other warhammer games then you ll like this one too there are enough improvements to justify the upgrade from wh2 and the new races are fun however the dlc pricing for this third game is becoming ridiculous 20 for the new chaos dwarfs dlc if you re going to invest your money in this franchise seriously consider what you are willing to spend at this point to buy the complete set of games and dlcs is pushing 200
