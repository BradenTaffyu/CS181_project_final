regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of space marine 2 as a veteran vermintide darktide player who loves 40k lore during the first launch of the game epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen i do not want it in my computer you have to go through loops to uninstall it there is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it when compared with darktide dawn of war series and especially mechanicus space marine 2 has the weakest music ost looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development as a cheap attempt the game is trying to draw more attention by twitch drops very terrible companion ai one of the worst i have seen for years they do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class and they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them such a shame no fov slider holding buttons to activate the abilities instead of hitting them is a terrible design choice throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds activating cloak takes another 2 5 seconds character gets hit during uncancellable animations every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything uncancellable dodge roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying controls feel very unresponsive boss fights are almost identical area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots melee charge attacks ranged attacks and one big 3 wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses melee combat is terribly designed interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points ranged weapons feel weak an elite enemy not a boss or a lecter takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs head or spray it from sides the enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp crowd control options are limited to grenades i suggest developers to play vermintide and dark tide to see how it is perfected during many years there is a hideous terrible jetpack mission i hated it multiple loading resources loading logic screens entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned it is bad you cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory pvp section of the game is the worst very unbalanced is this game not beta tested cheaters are out there already i have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks easy anticheat is known as how easy it is to bypass it a bad choice from the developers the number of the co op missions is very few these missions in general feel rushed unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation even the spawn locations are more or less the same unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy this is how the game targets longevity the game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly i do not expect it to have a long lifespan i was unable to pickup some medkits ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available pickup prompt was not there ranged enemies shoot with 120 accuracy and every shot lands perfectly there is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills this mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly cnclusion 6 10 wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must after the hype is dead the game will no longer be played by most of us i believe that space marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago
