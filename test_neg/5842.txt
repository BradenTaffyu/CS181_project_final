2018 i could complain about the censorship but that would besides the point this isn t a very good game what i will say regarding this is that all the redditors who suddenly have something to say when a neon sign of a woman gets censored and gambling gets taken out of a game but had nothing to say when negro which might have been a good thing since it got a lot of mexicans out of the game got your account perma banned automatically are getting their just desserts this is honestly my fault for buying this piece of i should have seen the writing on the wall it was there from the beginning good games don t have a f2p microtransaction economy in their 60 full price game with 30 dlc season passes they just don t good games don t take a season off of content creation to around with the ranked maps putting bad maps in the rotation taking good maps out then barely fixing the game making everyone wonder what the they were working on good games don t overload the game with characters that start to overlap not only up the balance of the game but also destroying the once semi realistic character design the game had good games don t have a ranking system that s still in beta is unplayable without 4 other friends and a casual mode that s used exclusively by trolls good games don t focus more on banning people who say the n word than they do on banning hackers griefers and all around toxic players good games don t have a fanbase that defends all of this then suddenly gets angry when a few slot machines are taken away this game s heyday will always be right after it came out before people realized 3 speeds could be abused back when the base operators basically covered any situation and figuring out how to breach a room was part of the fun the playerbase wasn t small i ve played smaller but it was generall full of mature adults guys who had played the previous games in the series and guys who wanted something different out of their average fps due to it s increase in popularity and the constant quad yearly updates it s not only become a shadow of what it once was but has been infected by a playerbase of squeakers ragers third worlders boomerang players those who only come back for every update and easily offended casuals addendum many people bought into this early on for the interesting dynamic that breaching heavily reinforced rooms or defending those reinforced rooms brought to the table now the game is cs go with wall penetration sometimes better sometimes worse ability to hear footsteps and hero abilities your ability to click heads and control a set pattern of recoil which was added in a later update to be more like cs is more important than your team strategy if you want proof of this see how many later operators have abilities that focus around 1v5 ing or abilities that could be considered support abilities as compared to the original operators whose abilities were almost entirely focused on either breaching or defending a room from breaching
