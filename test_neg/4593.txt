2021 i played on regular launcher during 2014 2017 so this number isn t representative of the total amount of my time wasted with this game i have been sober since early 2019 never play this my mental and general physical health has gotten better since then and stopping definitely was one of the things i needed to do the game s fluff and pr is built so that it makes you think you can take it in moderation you can t especially if you want to get any sort of equipment or bling without paying if you don t notice you re addicted it can quickly spiral out of control luckily i get tired after a while if i spend my free time on one single thing so i never went into true addiction mode i always came back hovewer so my case is more like an abusive relationship than the substance abuse parallel that happens for most people the game itself is fun for a while but it isn t hard or challenging it s repetitive tiresome and frustrating on the long term instead on higher levels btw the developers repeatedly state and seem to truly believe that halfway through the starchart 35 40 is high levels 100 is high levels that you need to have gear and balance for enemies only gain damage and effective health enemies become damage sponges even if you build against them and you become ground meat in an instant if you don t have good gear and learn to move and kill well which isn t hard to do this is all fine however this is all there is there are some objectives that are intended to be beaten by stategizing but all of them really have an easily exploitable single braincell requiring method of completion de also likes patching out and sometimes punishing players for creative methods they themselves failed to notice were possible when implementing a feature they label new ultimately stripping armor and or shields stacking dot or abusing the few top tier clearer frames is what you do for 2 5k hours for basically nothing you can show off your cool frame that you bought the tennogen skin for woo de also has a track record for displaying their overinflated head they ended up getting because of the runaway success of this game they have been known to spotlight and listen to influencers based strictly on identity politics and silence deplatform or even attack small content creators who objectively criticise the state of the game and the dev team policies they also promise big and deliver low on a regular basis this was the case for years by the time i left they haven t given me a reason to doubt they are still the same things i still like about his game are the movement equimpent variety fashion and aesthetic it s a shame it turned out this way
