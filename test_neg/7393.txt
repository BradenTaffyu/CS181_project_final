copy paste of 1st one but not as good the main mission is the same as 1st 0 replay no end game generic builds same bad guy over and over the best thing i didnt realize i beat the game it was dissapointing not worth money buy the 1st with dlc for like 5 its worth it too many fan boys giving positive reviews its a 40 game
