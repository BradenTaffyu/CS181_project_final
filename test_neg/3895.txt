2017 i am totally fine with paying 60 70 for a game with a quality like this but all the cashgrabbing decisions and generally having an extremely delayed pc version is pretty sad i spent most of my enjoyable hours in gta with community made mods and a third party multiplayer you guys eliminated 90 of the reasons why i bought this game in the first place thumbs down
