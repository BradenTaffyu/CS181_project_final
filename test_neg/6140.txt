2016 game was absolutely fun the first months of release devs it up through the year by not fixing bug abuses for months and instead adding bullsht survivor updates followed by bullsht killer updates for no reason at all except for catering to new players who enjoy easy and imbalanced games biased killers and biased survivors period players saying camping shouldn t matter as they can finish generators and escape while the killer is camping when that is not the point i don t know why you want to play a game where you hold left click on a generator and spacebar for 5 minutes and then leave there s a reason why altruism and boldness is in the game it s not about escaping it s about gameplay
