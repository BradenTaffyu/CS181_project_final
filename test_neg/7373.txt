i wish i could recommend this game i really do i am 85 hours play time and i have loved every minute of it going wherever i want doing whatever i want for me the fantasy and immersion of this game is unreal and unmatched imo i ve bloody loved every second of it it was amazing i say was because my game is now stuck in ctd loop crash to desktop that i do not know how to resolve i have an extremely highly capable pc i was able to brute force my way through most of the performance issues people were having as of the last 24 hours i do not know what has changed the game was not patched my graphics drivers did not get an update verifying file integrity in steam does not help administrator mode toggles do nothing bottoming out the graphics does nothing restarting my computer does nothing making sure everything is closed except steam and this game does nothing nothing does nothing everything does nothing i can no longer play the game for more than 30 60 seconds without a hard ctd and then spending the next 2min as the capcom crash error reporter collects data to send to capcom to tell them their game is hard broken the only thing i can think of is that my save is corrupt in some way because i am close to vernworth city and the closer i get to it the faster i can make it crash i don t want a refund i don t want to stop playing the game please fix the game capcom it s a masterpiece that wants to be played but i am literally incapable of doing so i want to change this review to positive i really do
