2021 i wasn t really planning on making this since there s not much i can say that hasn t already been said yes i have over 300 hours as of now and will likely keep playing those looking to buy might ask why did you play that much then but avid players might say wow those are baby hours lmao so there s essentially no winning for me here this game suffers greatly from lazy and or incompetent developers due to having virtually zero competition they thrive off what is an extremely unique and fun style of game by doing the bear minimum patchs are barren and scarce new characters are a roll of the dice if they ll be good fun broken or bring an unhealthy change to the meta people largely get into this game because they see a character they recognize and it makes them clap so they ll overlook the glaring problems the game has many of which could be helped with small number changes i m talking changing a single number for a perk but the devs don t care to even try survivor players will say it s fair and balanced yet only use the same pool of 5 8 perks out of 50 and then wonder why killers play super boring and lame killers will use the scarce few perks that are any good for them or even use the same unfun to play against killers like spirit hag clown etc and wonder why survivors bring tons of items and ds every game it s not the players fault at the end of the day it s because the game encourages boring play styles so it s up to the players to put limitations on themselves to find fun if you can do that and tell yourself that there really is no win or lose state simply just do your best than you can enjoy this game a fair bit but if you re looking for any sort of serious competitive play don t bother a 4k for the killer isn t a win same for an escape as a survivor they re simply just how things rolled out many times due to little or no input of your own the community is largely unhelpful too i ve run into many very nice people while playing even hopped into a few streamers chats who i was playing against and they ve been nice but for every one of those you re going to get 50 jerk offs who think too much of themselves check my profile comments for examples you get just as many sore winners as you do sore losers and it s the easiest way to make even a victory an annoyance to be fair bantering back at these people is very easy to do and quite fun then they delete their comments in embarrassment this game needs competition to kick the developers into doing more than the minimum here s hoping monstrum 2 will do good check that out by the way pre orders are up and it s out this month january of 2021 monstrum 2 has come out in an extremely rough state probably not a lot of hope there in the mean time i ll probably keep playing every now and then it s extremely comfy and easy for me to stream and offers a great grind if you re like me and enjoy a good grind edit check these videos for a good idea of what i mean by incompetent lazy devs they re also a great laugh youtube video almo the game designer of dbd views 94 613 this video is not intended to throw shade or offend almo this is purely a video to have a good laugh at some misplays and funny moments courtesy of the game designer of dbd youtube video according to the statistics almo the game designer dead by daylight views 63 005 once again this video is not to offend or to throw shade at almo he is a wonderful person and doesn t deserve any mean comments towards him
