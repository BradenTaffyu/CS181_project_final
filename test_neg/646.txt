2017 i have spent near 800 hours in this game i know that is not much compared to other people but i think i know this game very well i am dmg was before i stopped playing and i can tell you now this game is not terrible i just trhink valve doesn t care anymore the community is cancer and i donnt want to be edgy i really mean it i almost never found a nice teammate or somebody who was actually as good as they thought at this game and when you do you usally find cheaters which brings me to the next point vac is absolute and always fais to find cheaters the only way cheaters get banned is through community reports and even then players have to avaluate the evidence and tell if they are cheating or not valve doen t do basically the learning curve is huge and u ll be untill you have like 300 hour and after that since you ve devoted so much time into the game you wont want to stop playing sionce you think you e wasted so much timeso after this if you still want to buy the game go for it i had a lot of fun i just think that the current state of the game is horrible and i am happy to say i wont come back
