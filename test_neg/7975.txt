2023 please do not buy this you will regret it later down the lineif i was to describe the game in one line it would be novel at first dull and lonely in the endi ve spent 100 hours now and i majorly regret the purchase even refunded it originally only to decide i would give it a real try now that i cant refund it im sad i didnt keep the money not so much for the money itself but because of what this game offersthis game offers zero actual solo enjoyment the people you find randomly either just leave afk or act incredibly rude and mean if you dont have friends this will not be a way to make some rather a constant source of struggles and upsets by a horrible and abusive playerbase that just want to make others feel bad theres some customization but you get like 10 000 gold in an hour if you re efficient ish and you need like a million for anything nice essentially anyway the new captain thing is nice but a lot of it is designed for players that play a lot and the rest is just cash shop stuffthe solo ish missions and the tall tales which is like adventures you go on are dull with little to not rewards other than some basic cosmetics they arent that fun and they are set in the same multiplayer ocean where others can interrupt and stop and destroy your mission i meet some nice people from time to time but thats the exception rather than the norm and when things go south people turn toxic incredibly fast i can not un recommend this enough go get a totally legal version that you can play on a custom solo server or go play another game like rust or something that would have much more in actuality to dothe music is nice but after 30 hours the same 14 songs get rather dull to play on repeat theres some random mini game like things to do like fishing which i guess is nice albeit barely profitable in comparison and at the end of the day they are mostly tediom without true joy the meat and potato s in this game is the people and again if thats what you come for the combat its clunky aim has some wierd custom controls you have to set up the the guns dont really have reticules or any sort of aim which is fine once you learn but for a new player can be upsetting and pulling out your sword when you run out or an enemy comes close takes way too long its like do able and ive won multiple fights against multiple opponents against me but its eh at best ship combat i mean its okay albeit the solo sloop one cannon just gets outmatched in every single way and gets out run if you are two people youll end up wanting a brig for the extra cannon theres up and downsides to everything but ultimately it just isnt a very nice experience especially when you have to rely on other people and players over all i hate it its a waste of 80 gigabytes of space that you could install 5 6 better games with save your money enjoy yourself with something that will truly feel rewarding and nice this has done nothing but give me upset from the first couple of hours till now i wish the best for you on your journey
