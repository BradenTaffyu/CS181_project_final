2016 let me start off this review with stating that i love the game this game is absolutely bananas it s so much fun and the gameplay gets your adrenaline pumping but most of the fun it could be offering is being taken away from us more on that later the gameplay as the killer as you re stalking your prey and looking out for the survivors knowing they re not able to defend themselves is like childs play after finally spotting your prey and chasing them as the survivor helplessly tries to get away from you makes you feel like a real psychopath after catching your prey you can either grab your prey over your shoulder and take the survivor to your dungeon and hang him up on a meathook or leave him suffering there on the ground and use him as bait taunt and scare your prey if you re playing as the hillybilly by revving up your chainsaw to help your prey get rid of constipation spook your enemies to the death whilst playing as the wraith by uncloaking yourself and gong your bell lay traps near objectives as the trapper so you can wait in the bushes for them to step on them and then either waiting for others to help the helpless pray you ve just caught or just hang him on a meathook it s your choice after either killing all of your prey or letting some of them escape you re rewarded with points to upgrade your power and investing points into your skilltree gives you the feeling of accomplishment as a survivor you re trying to work on the objectives at the same time as you re trying to keep one eye open for the killer getting spotted by the killer and being chased through the scary and atmospheric environments is just nothing but scary helping your friends out of trouble whilst risking your own life at the same time makes you feel like a hero and scavenging for anything to help you survive is breathtaking whilst completed the required objectives to get the go ahead and open up the gates to escape the horrors and running out of the playground of the killer feels rewarding investing points you ve gained throughout your adventures of either misfortune or success to your skilltree makes you feel accomplished the problems too bad you can t get the satisfaction this game offers to you of the last points that i mentioned from neither from the killer s perspective or the survivor s because you can only play this game with friends in a private game which doesn t offer you any experience points or the chance to progress your characters which is the only reason i dislike this game the developers must include a party option to this game so you can make a lobby for your friends to queue up for a ranked game as survivors not one being the killer and the rest as survivors that d be cheating if the devs consider queing up with your friends in the same team cheating they ve got to be joking the only logical reason this wasn t implemented to the game must ve been because they could inform their friends where the killer is via 3 party program there are no any other ways to communicate with other survivors in the game they need to add a proximity voice chat so anyone can hear your voice if they re in your proximity the killer included great alternative for this would a voiceline wheel with restrictions e g not being able to use voiceline wheel when stuck in a meathook having the killer also hear these voicelines if he s close enough to the survivors making this option very fair the conclusion the only reason keeping me from recommending this game for you your friends is the reason stated above if they decide to update the game and allow us to queue up with friends as survivors into a same game where you could make progress with your character then i would recommend this game for you missing on an important game mechanic of improving your character being taken away from and punishing you for playing the game with your friends is absurd and very bad game design i only recommend this game to you if you re planning on playing alone with randoms to get the most out of the game if played with friends is to wait for the devs to release the party queue
