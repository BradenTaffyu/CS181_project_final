2015 gta v a game that would be amazing if it wasn t so plagued by it s own community speaking strictly in terms of online multiplayer the game is infected a solid 2 out of every 3 sessions has a miserable kid with a mod menu endlessly spawning npcs fire explosions and other annoying entities on the players and of course rockstar introduced online challenges mini games which pit the players head to head to win a cash reward naturally if you re close to winning you ll be any modder s main target this awful infestation of cheaters has made the game outright frustrating to play with others something that gta is meant to be about despite the unfortunate multiplayer environment the game remains very solid in private sessions and singleplayer game modes more unfortunately however is the fact that public multiplayer is the game mode most people want to play therefore i can t recommend this game in it s current toxic state
