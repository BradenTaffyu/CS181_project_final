2023 wow looked up the post myself because i didn t want to believe it the right to discuss is a privilege cathe amount of effort ca has put into butchering their public relations recently is honestly inspiring i remember when ca s dreams were more important to them than their wallets those days are gone another reviewer said it s time to accept that the ca we knew and loved is dead and that s very likely true some advice revive three kingdoms with one or two fairly priced dlcs invest in fixing and polishing the base game for tww3 then layout a public road map on how you re going to give your once loyal and adoring fans back the ca they remember edit to the people defending the pricing of titles such as this with lines such as it s just the price of a pizza and a soda that is comparing apples to nuclear submarines if ca was making a pizza and providing a soda to each and every single player individually the effort expense to profit ratio makes sense they are not making pizzas and providing sodas however they are in fact developing something called video games granted it can take considerable effort to develop said video games each game only has to be developed once just once now if you divide up that one time effort equally between millions of purchases while i still grant it s a lot of effort in total i promise that the divided effort per purchase does not equate to a pizza and a soda that is why game companies that are even somewhat successful become cash cows beyond any accountant s wildest wet dream and will often recycle content and engines as long as they can to milk their fans over and over for less and less work that s also why small companies with a lot of talent and love can become millionaire game dev superstars with just one or two successful titles and then they get bought out by take two the bottom line is please don t compare games to pizzas
