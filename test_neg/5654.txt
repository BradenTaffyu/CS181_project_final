2016 when this game was released i fell in love with everything about it however after constant cheating i eventually decided it was time to take a long break until ubisoft could sort it out well months passed and the game is still a complete mess with no real consequence to cheating it has completely ruined this game and ubisoft have been completely incompetent in handling it really do not buy this game infact it will be the last ubisoft competitive game i will ever buy unless the company really sorts itself out
