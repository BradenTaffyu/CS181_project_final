2019 i have more hours in the game now and want to add my new and current impressions i feel like players you encounter are not as toxic anymore i barely saw insults or too ez comments after the matches thrown at new players or someone who was having a hard time mostly you just get a some gg s and thats it thats much more pleasant how much fun the killer game is kinda depends on the matchmaking not to be paired with way better survivors how much fun the survivor game is highly depends on the killers gameplay and on your teammates not being quitters one quitter already can highly imbalances your chances and is annyoing for everyone the killer can mess up the game by tunneling attacking always the same already hurt survivor and taking them out of the game early or worse by just facecamp them while they are on the hook while this might not work on a team of experiences survivors it messes up the experience in random groups or to new players it doesnt even make sense as you get more points if you hook several people for several times one advice i d give players is to keep your goals in check like make up some ammount of bloodpoints you want to reach and not necersarily to escape or to kill all the survivors if you play with friends only it is always a fun experience and in public matches if the survivor team has no quitters the killer plays decent which unfortunatelly only happens in maybe every second game and you keep your goals in check you can have good times with the game edit it appears they try to get rid of their ingame issues by deleting any mention of them after some really bad rounds i posted my recent experience in their discussions looking for a conversation on how they could be adressed my topic was deleted within minutes and i got a warning for witch hunt when i asked why such a topic gets deleted because it seems like important issues and does not violate any steam rules or guidelines nor any custom discussion rules i got immediatally banned for discussing disciplinary action too bad problems do not disappear just because you try to ignore them just like me and this review
