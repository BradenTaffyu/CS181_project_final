2022 something about this ai is just frustrating i m never excited for the next turn because i know it s going to be something absurd i have thousands of hours in this trilogy but i can t stomach more than 40 turns of a campaign in this game before thinking i don t care enough to deal with this it hardly ever feels like you re actually strategizing just playing wack a mole with factions that would gladly sacrifice their existence for the chance to march 24 turns through their enemies past my allies to blow up one settlement and then get deleted for it before you know it you own a quarter of the map by just reacting to suicidal ai you don t even need to declare war they will constantly seek you out at this point i d rather just skip the campaign map all together and just have battles strung together in a narrative campaign battles are good praise sigmar
