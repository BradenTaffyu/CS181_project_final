2017 as an old school cs 1 6 player i ve been disappointed to see this game evolve downwards over the years i ve been giving it multiple chances but it just cannot grow on me no matter what it doesn t radiate the same vibes as it s predecessors no it s not nostalgia taking the wheel here you will find a ton of things what made cs 1 6 css great which are very wrongly implemented in go this game s main focus has been skins revenue for the last 3 years if anyone thinks otherwise they sure live in a thick little bubble competitive matchmaking system new weapons therefore more strats you learn russian development focused on aesthetics terrible matchmaking balance hit registration hitbox feels like p2p lack of custom skins mod which only you see awful anti cheat for one of the most played games not made by valve
