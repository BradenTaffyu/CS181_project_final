2019 there is a very good reason players with hundreds of hours of playtime to rate dead by daylight negatively the game as an experience has progressively gone from tolerable to as good as being burned alive reaching a point where your only hope for a balanced fun play through is playing with 3 other friends on microphones executing a well rehearsed and effective strategy against your killer anything less than that as a survivor will have you experience the many many bad sides of this game oh and as far as playing killer goes with the plethora of exploits and terrible mechanics survivors have you will be the one feeling gutted at the end the developers are money hungry and unwilling to spend a small amount of their earnings or at least their time on fixing the wealth of problems the lack of dedicated servers absolutely unbearable amount of verbal abuse and zero reward for playing any other way than intended by the devs and the exceedingly toxic vocal player community all in all don t believe the youtube videos and the memes this is not a fun game it is loaded with bugs years after release it gets worse every update and the ship is quickly sinking why else are seasoned players with 100s if not 1000s of hours in writing negative reviews en masse do the math
