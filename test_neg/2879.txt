2019 got banned from gta online for 30 days by rockstar even though ive never modded hacked or griefed in this game so i am not recommending this is they are going to ban innocent people not only that they are going to reset my character acting as if i modded values also not recommending this as in private matches for gtao you cannot do much the game forces you to deal with the cancerous griefers in this online community and lastly the store is generic and boring online is the only thing worth playingbut after almost 100 hours and now i am getting banned for nothing when i know people who actually mod and either never get banned or only get a 2 week or less slap on the hand i think this game is really boring alonepayouts for jobs and missions online are terrible sometimes it feels like there are too many things to check on everytime im online other players can ruin your game by stealing your stuff in the online mode there are tons of things i really think suck about this game if i could id return it and spend my 20 spent on this on something else the only good thing is when i get friends and we can clear a public room and just do our things without having to worry about griefers the mk2 oppressor users and the orbital cannon users playing with friends can be the only redemption unless you like greifers and a terrible moderation system that bans you for being in a room with random modders who you report but inturn somehow are banned instead guess they dont know what the f ck they are doing so cheers good luck to you if you decide to buy it it was fun before i got banned for a month for playing the game legitly and grinding my off for little to no payout and i hope you dont run into any hackers and modders that cause you to meet the same fate as me unless rockstar changes their mind and removes my ban doesnt reset my account idk why they are in the first place i may change my review cause i did have some fun until the grinding became the only thing to do it is more fun with friends 7 10 for the game itself1 10 for their moderation service especially since i know modders who are still active and never banned but i get banned 2 10 for rockstar as they need to fix this game a lotbetter payouts more ways to pay associates without having to swapbeing able to use the motorcycle club and ceo stuff in private modes and without having to change between being a mc president and a ceo cause that is tedious and annoying and for a better moderation service that is why rockstar is receiving a 2 10 from me the game isnt terrible tho but if i am getting banned for being innocent i cannot recommend this game
