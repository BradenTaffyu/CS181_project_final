putting aside issue with the game optimization which i rarely encountered during my 200 hrs gameplay except in the main city game been stuttering since the new patch was out overall it has immersive world fun combat interesting exploration of map pawn feature is great so to make you feel less lonely during your adventure giving a thumb down for the reasons below1 too much wasted useless features eg all the mats you gotten from the game are useless enhancement yes but equipment enhancement often need 1 4 of the mats only 2 story feels unfinished what the hell was the plot again dragon hunting throne scheming and politics saving the world how much content has been cut off during development hmm 3 devs been quiet having played bg3 and how the devs been communicating with the players rolling out patches and hotfixes dont think dd2 devs team giving a bout the game and its community so far i do recommend anyone interested to grab a copy when discounted it is fun amazing but just not worth the price you will be paying at the moment
