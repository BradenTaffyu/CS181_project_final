2020 noita is an abusive relationship you learn to walk on eggshells learn when to dodge and when to take hits you learn to avoid anything toxic you are addicted and can t leave but you want to you know better than to try to snoop or explore otherwise you ll be punished but sometimes you have to or you won t make it to the next day you learn everything that the game wants from you and execute it perfectly but still get beat you have a good run or day sometimes and everything is great but then you do something or maybe you do nothing and you get killed it s not a game for everyone it s not a fair challenge like say hades but a brutal and slower risk of rain 1 if it were a 25 cent arcade game you d spend 100 just trying to beat it take the 98 positive reviews with a grain of salt i ve only got 18 hours on record which about 3 5 hours of which is probably just screwing around on the surface and while i haven t beaten the game the victory achievement i ve gotten to the 6th level which has only been accomplished by about 6 of the players and only by being extremely careful only about 1 3 of the players have even gotten to the second floor and getting to the second floor is stupidly easy compared to the later levels people recognize that it is a good concept but few have put the effort or frustration in few ever will noita is a good game on paper it s engine is fantastic the lore is interesting though it may ultimately prove lackluster but it s brutal and takes a lot of time and dedication for very minimal progress it doesn t give two licks about you exploration and curiosity is often punished it s a game that i think wants you to push past the punishment until you make it work through gameplay knowledge and rng you will have runs where your rng is bad and while you might be able to slip past enemies and get further without finding a lot of gold or getting a strong wand setup you will ultimately die truth is only about 12 of the people who buy the game get to the point where they are actually able to play it and have more consistent success some people have died 100 times without a win so the question is is this a game you will actually enjoy with 25 or less you could buy hades or risk of rain and they would be much more immediately enjoyable and accessible rouge likes if you only had 25 to spend on one game and only planned to play one game for a very long while noita would be a fine contender if you don t mind having minimal story and slow paced brutal exploration as the core game play mechanic and don t mind a game that doesn t keep your progress in any way from run to run but there d be much better options if you didn t want to be frustrated 90 of the time
