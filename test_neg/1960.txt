this game desperately needs the ability to remap all keys and have multiple hotkeys use the same button for example moving space which is connected to 4 or 5 different things isn t possible because the remapping features only allow you to set a key to one of those actions it also needs multi monitor support this game only launches and runs properly on monitor 1 you can move it but if you do none of the controls work everything that i watch about it is promising but since its not playable in its current state for me i m going to have to give this a thumbs down for now
