2017 r is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds possibly thousands of players their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it i worked hard during some of their double cash and rp events and had it all taken away as illegitimate right before the release of the next dlc i thought it was in error and i put in a detailed help ticket explaining how i earned the money through their events i received a generic response that i was exploiting the game my shark card money was taken away as well do not buy this game
