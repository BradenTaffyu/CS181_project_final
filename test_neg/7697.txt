2023 i have around 1000 hours on xbox live prior to cancelling my subscription and getting this game on steam so here s my review sea of thieves offers a visually stunning game play experience with its beautiful and vibrant world the game s picturesque environments from sun drenched beaches to treacherous storms at sea provide a visually immersive and captivating setting additionally sea of thieves excels in providing engaging quests and dynamic events that keep players on their toes whether it s embarking on treasure hunts fending off skeletons or unraveling intriguing mysteries the game offers a variety of activities that can be truly enjoyable however one aspect where sea of thieves falters is in its pvp model while the game allows for player versus player encounters these interactions often devolve into mindless attempts to board ships rather than engaging in strategic ship battles this lack of depth in the pvp mechanics can lead to repetitive and less satisfying gameplay experiences it would benefit from more nuanced combat mechanics and a greater emphasis on tactical decision making during ship to ship encounters sea of thieves suffers from a glaring lack of progression the game fails to provide a satisfying sense of growth or accomplishment for players without a robust progression system there is little incentive to continue playing and investing time in the game the absence of meaningful rewards for completing quests or taking part in activities diminishes the overall motivation to explore and engage with the world another major letdown is the in game currency which is rendered essentially worthless the accumulation of gold in sea of thieves serves little purpose beyond cosmetic purchases and even those options are limited in variety the lack of meaningful economic game play mechanics leaves players feeling unfulfilled and underwhelmed as their efforts to amass wealth in the game hold little value or significance in conclusion sea of thieves features beautiful game play engaging quests and dynamic events that make for an immersive pirate adventure however improvements are needed in its pvp model to move beyond mindless ship boarding and focus on more strategic ship battles additionally enhancing the progression system and providing more valuable uses for in game currency would further enrich the game play experience and provide players with a greater sense of accomplishment and purpose
