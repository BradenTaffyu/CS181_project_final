2017 rockstar and take2 have sent cease and desist to developers of openiv another example of how rockstar treats the single player community like rockstar and take2 has favored online over single player since the game was released in late 2013 almost 4 years and rockstar has coughed up a new dlc for multiplayer every couple months yet single player hasnt seen a single one mods and their creators make the game better then the developers could ever do and some companies have realized that and support modding unfortunatly rockstar and take2 are not one of them i understand they want to prevent modding in multiplayer and they can very well do that but dont let single players suffer for that will no longer support rockstar and take2 because of their constant arrogance greed and ing of the single player community
