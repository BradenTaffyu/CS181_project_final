for all the improvements made to the core gameplay loop a glaring issue can be found in the half arsed implementation of the operations mode unlike it was claimed by the devs it does not have a solo play mode it also doesn t have a proper way to ensure we are the hosts forcing us to matchmake into an unstable pool of players with extremely long load times we cannot kick them while they are loading players who are either afk or are playing dress up or simply hanging lobbies that don t even load at all this lack of control has personally forced me to leave several lobbies nearly every time i want to play a mission i cannot recommend the game while one of the features that offers it replayability is held back by such a poorly thought out matchmaking system allow for private lobbies and give us a server list this has been solved for decades
