2023 unfortunately with time rainbow six siege has fell flat a tactical 5v5 military sim shooter players are tasked with handling counter terror situations like bomb defusal or hostage similar to counter strike but with customisation characters with their own personality and skill sets like team fortress 2 the game has took multiple drastic changes over the years and in return the game has lost the charm it s what had with multiple issuesmultiple characters went from good to bad or bad to good and your just not sure how fast your character can fall out of the games usefulness meta leaving you having to switch a lot also you will really have to commit to playing even if you hate it as the skill gap for this game is high and if you stop for a bit you can get punished for it alot of things to learn and sometimes it can be alot especially if you wanna stay goodthe art style also took a drastic change leaving me confused as that tactical mil sim vibe kinda got turned into a superhero overwatch vibe consider that one member is a decorated sas operator and the other member is a albino tech scientist who never touched a gun and you can see where it gets weirdalso this games community is mad toxic i ve seen my fair share of toxic communities but at least in cod they can t kill you if you are part of the team teammates are such a make or break in siege that it just becomes unbearable to try if they wontbasically skill issue lol but also this game just isn t what it used to be try it if you want maybe you will enjoy it but for me and as someone that was here since the games first beta on xbox i can t recommend itsiege still to me is a 7 3 10 but it used to be higher one of the games where i just have to say see for yourself
