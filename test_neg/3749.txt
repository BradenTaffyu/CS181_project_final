2015 rockstar games parent company take two interactive forcefully shut down the development of alternative multiplayer platforms fivem and gta mp which is horrible considering the guys at fivem and gta mp with extremely limited resources built or tried to build a better product than rockstar games did with gta online single player does not appeal after being beaten once and gta online is saturated with issues and there is nothing to do after 50 100 hours yes you can try to have fun with friends in a private session if all goes well but thats just not enough i hope someone at take two interactive realises that mods prolong the life of a game on pc for example the elder scrolls v skyrim even after 5 years its still one of the top selling games even rockstar games own grand theft auto san andreas which is still active even after more than a decade has passed since its release this is because of the mods sa mp and mta sa also take a look at just cause 2 they have an official multiplayer mod which is infact built by the community this is probably the last game i ever pre ordered and definitely the last game i will buy from take two interactive atleast at the full price they have overlooked community needs to earn profits and when the community tried to build something on their own they used their power to crush them unless they change their attitude towards what a consumer community wants so long
