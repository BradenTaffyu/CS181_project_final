2022 my main problem with elden ring is that this game is sekiro bloodborn speed without the mechanics that make sekiro bloodborn work enemies are so fast and relentless with their attacks and you have very very slim chances to actually fight back this is particularly noticeable on the later bosses where they have these insane 5 9 hit combos that they then have less than a two second punish window before they launch off into another chain they also have way more health than most bosses in ds3 on average and most of them can instantly kill you even with a pretty hefty investment into health if you had the rally mechanic from bloodborn or the deflect from sekiro this game would be completely different as it is the game punishes you severely for being aggressive with the completely over tuned damage of the later bosses this tends to really impact colossal weapons more severely than it does faster weapons due to the fact that so many openings are so short you might not even get a single swing out safely after dodging 6 10 attacks what this does to combat is essentially makes the optimal way to fight anything simply to passively dodge all the attacks and only go for the punish when you know for a fact its free damage but since the enemies are so aggressive and have such long chains you ll find yourself spending the majority of most fights just dodging over and over again players insist you can balance this with the summons since they are meant to be part of the balance for the game but what self respecting fromsoft fan is going to want to use summons to beat the game the entire point of the game and the dev s have said this is for everyone to be on the same level as far as difficulty well if that s the case why are the summon ashes so bloody strong and have zero downsides clearly a mage player with a summons is not having the same time as a melee player with an ugs they literally betrayed their own design philosophy with this system and the result is that the bosses are hilariously over tuned against a single target again if i could deflect attacks if i could regain hp lost trading hits if i could do anything besides just spending 90 of the fight rolling around waiting for my turn to hit back this would be a very different game my other major problem is the absolutely unacceptable amount of recycled bosses this game has 165 bosses and maybe 10 of them are not reused the dragons are reused 6 times the erdtree avatar is reused 13 times that s insane to have a single boss be reused that many times
