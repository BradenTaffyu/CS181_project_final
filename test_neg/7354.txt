do not buy this game until it is fixed if it gets fixed i have a decently beefy rig and was getting 25 30 fps in open world scenarios and 20 25 during combat and in cities the game is gorgeous the soundtrack slaps the combat is so much better but it has been months and it still runs like garbage however now that there is a two hour trial if you can deal with the performance issues and can get this on sale i d say go for it oh my other complaint my pawns have never said wolves hunt in packs arisen 5 10
