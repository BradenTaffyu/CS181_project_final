2017 grand theft auto v a fun open world game just what you d expect from gta the story is quite good and the characters are memorable driving around los santos is amazing and it has a lot of stuff for you to do those were the positives now onto the negatives pretty much everything in online mode is absolutely overpriced to the point where you have to either farm for cash for several hours if not even days for that one thing you really want or just pay up yes microtransactions a decent ingame sports car that would be about 10 to 15 real life bucks sir in addition i m experiencing many crashes the game apparently can t run for 2 hours without crashing no this can not be attributed to my bad pc xd it s simply poor optimisation on rockstar s part many newer features anything that has to do with being ceo of a company or part of a group of bikers probably more features as well are only accessible in a public lobby meaning you ll have to deal with griefers cheaters and in general every time you start the online mode you will be drowned in text messages and phone calls that are basically rockstar s way of nagging you to pay for their microtransactions in addition the singleplayer mode has and will not recieve any of the new weapons and cars as far as i know all in all i would recommend you don t play the game rockstar already have enough whales to make microtransacion money off
