waited for the big update to write a review after 300 hours now i can say this game is just a waste of storage space tfd doesn t respect your time nor give you fun and engaging grind experience when you start the game you probably would enjoy it until you reach endgame at endgame the grind is convoluted boring and unrewarding also the drop rate is kinda suspicious but it s kinda expected because it s nexon either you get frustation and uninstall the game or you give up and spend money i had very low expectation for season 1 update and it s actually even lower than my expectation after it released time gated content with bull crap mechanic i don t know how the devs think this is fun the invasions misions are just anti fun in a looter shooter game i m gonna uninstall for now and see what s gonna happen in the future might try it again if nexon truly improve the game but i don t have high hope
