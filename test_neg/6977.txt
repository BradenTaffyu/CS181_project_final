2016 campaigncons linear story no alternative endings like how black ops ii was a bit dissappointing but hey does anyone really play cod games for the campaign anymore pros kit customization use different perks like nano swarms or invisiblity camo to help you manuever levels have 6 attachments on your guns and create crazy setups good story nothing great but isn t a bore to play the game alludes to previous games and makes references easy to follow and understand but you know some people still don t understand how to point and shoot in the comments theres even a zombie version of the campaign if you finish it the first time through multiplayercons autobalance is crap you re either playing on the team destroying or the team getting destroyed i ve only had a few close enjoyable games where both teams had a chance matchmaking is crap half the time you get placed in lobbies about to begin a match and the other half you re just joining a game thats about to end weapon balance is just stupid smgs seemingly kill in less bullets than rifles and shotguns have the range of a rifle a 6 burst lmg requires 2 bursts to sometimes kill your enemy the addition of those supply drop weapons makes balancing even worse one shot kill pistol knife shooting side arm one shot that also can meelee one shot pros gamepad support is great my 360 and one controllers both work fine with this game solid fps and graphics this game definitely runs great in multiplayer if you have the minimum specs required splitscreen support want to play with a buddy you can surely play with keyboard controller or 2 controllers seen countless lobbies with people using splitscreen specialists abilities are fun to use seeing activision use destiny s ability system is a great tool in the game although the purifier ability is a bit overpowered each ability adds into the game to help each team and can give an edge in objective based gameplay wall running is useful exo boosting is limited zombiescons matchmaking for a multiplayer zombies lobby can take forever and when you do get into a lobby everyone one needs to ready up which some players take forever to do unless you have dlc you re limited to playing one map kind of a bummer but if you do decide to buy the dlc for the zombies maps it is well worth it the dlc levels are well designed for the gameplay and puzzles that they offer pros solo runs fine i ve had no issues if you have minimum specs then the game looks and runs great splitscreen support is great don t like playing zombies by yourself grab a controller and buddy same as multiplayer i ve been in zombie lobbies with splitscreeners overall reviewif you can get over some of the cons the game has to offer then there is fun to be found in this game i would not recommend this game to someone who has never touched a fps pc game before and i recommend waiting until there is a sale for this game i m gonna give this game a solid 6 10buy it for the zombies and or
