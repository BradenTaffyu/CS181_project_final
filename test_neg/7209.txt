played for about 4 hours in albeit at a really slow pace because i wanted to test the limits of the game and fool around a bit the good it s a good rpg at its core with good combat mechanics gameplay elements and in general just solid gameplay design outside of a few things we ll get to that the bad let s get it out the way first the game is very very very badly optimised in not just the performance optimisation but also the graphical aspect of it it s not a bad looking game but it s not exactly a super good looking one and definitely not one that should be so graphically intensive not to mention the cpu intensiveness in town the graphics texture themselves are rather dated and in the grand scheme of things look like something out of the age of monster hunter world while having about a 2 to 4 times graphics processing requirement for context cpu 7800x3d gpu amd 7800xt frame rate at 1440p without frame gen tech below 60 in the main screen around 60 80fps around normal play that s atrociously bad graphic optimisation not to mention city issues many design elements makes sense in the first dragon s dogma and no longer do these days why is the riftstone mechanics making a reversal compared to what was implemented in dragon s dogma s dark arisen why is the game design taking a step backwards bad game qol in first game being propagated back to the second even after so many years issues with single save file issue with how the save is being done issue with how romance works with the game the list goes on story wise tbh i feel like it s higher production value worse execution but this is just personal preference ymmv the mtx thing leaves a sour taste in my mouth because it gives the vibes that the qol features arent properly implemented so that they mtx at least makes some sense if you are reading this review and want to have 1 takeaway it is that although the game is fun i will highly recommend to at the minimum delay the purchasing of the game until it s on sale it s not 70 dollar good even on a pc like mine which can run it without issues with some help i e frame gen fsr tuning down some configs and running it at 1440p instead of 4k moreover it s very evident that it s an incomplete game that is released at this timing because capcom is looking for the last inflow of revenue before the end of the financial year if you still want to play the game badly and is willing to pay full price but feel guilty about buying the game in its current state situation delay until after 1st april and then buy it it will at least have an impact and send the message to capcom via the yearly financial results edit i am adding on to this review after about 50 hours into the game about a week later i am not editing anything above but looking back at my own early review it really foreshadows the deeper issues i find with the game that most people will find and for those who are looking for a takeaway from the revisit it is that to get any value out of this purchase this game will need to be purchased a year or two from now during a sale after confirmation that the deep rooted issues has been fixed as it is right now the greatest accomplishment this game has done is convinced me to not buy monster hunter wilds on release despite all the friends i have within the community additional pros and cons with the game after 50 hours pros core gameplay loops especially with larger sized monsters is really fun exploration within the game can be fun with high peaks discovery of new areas new monsters and low lows i e walking simulator with a repetitive wolf goblin saurian encounter every 30 seconds that is just stun stagger galore in either direction cons the story was subjectively worse in terms of vibe in the first 5 hours of play it s objectively worse as the story goes along as the buildup for the first portion of the game ended in a grand pile of nothing and results in just oh just go to the next city to talk to this guy main storyline is pretty lacklustre and the side quests have close to zero impact to the world at large and it really showcases capcom s weakness in story writing within a narrative driven rpg context which admitedly i should have saw this a mile coming considering i played both dmc and monster hunter and the storyline is meme worthy when at its best incompleteness in so so so many aspects monsters scaling is super off even before end game i have not yet reached there yet but encounters within towns typically take a few seconds each for the typical mob and big monsters like golems griffins etc barely takes a minute that s with a build that isnt even end game equipment augments etc yet with a vocation that generally is classified on the lower end of the brokeness spectrum archer monster variety is strictly worse than dark arisen and in terms of repetitive nation of most portion of the gameplay gives off early generation assassin s creed open world vibes aka around ac3 good action rpgs tend of introduce depth nuances and complexity or at least the neccesity of understanding those as the game progresses and this game has very little of that advanced classes are not straight up upgrades of the basic classes but are complete different classes that often have a different power scale which can be worse or better than a basic class all in all the game feels very incomplete and reminiscent of dragon s dogma 1 before dark arisen which is in all accounts an incomplete game even in the eyes of the dd1 game directory with that in mind the fact that dragon s dogma 2 came out at full price at the exact same state with improvement in some areas while also worse off in others is a straight up disgrace while the foundation for a great game is there the potential is never fulfilled and even though there will be folks that bring up the potential of a dlc like dark arisen was to dd1 to bring it up to par why should anyone accept an incomplete product at a complete price point and release for those who are thinking to buy this please just buy it on sale one year or two later after release and after being sure that there has been a fix for all these issue either via patches or dlc because honestly capcom has done a masterful job of convincing me to never buy anything at full price at launch from them going forward considering the terrible experience that got worse with each release from monster hunter world to monster hunter rise to now dragon s dogma 2 third time is not the charm for capcom but at least it s for me to learn the lesson of not buying any of the hype they put out and that game day reviews tends to not be able to cover reach the point in the game where the incompleteness of the game becomes evident
