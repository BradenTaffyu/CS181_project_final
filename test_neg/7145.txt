2017 multiplayer was fun but i found the most fun versing offline bots combat training back in bo1 was my jam and i still play it from time to time zombies is pretty nice but i didn t really find any of the maps as iconic as those in previous titles though they do bring some of them back in their latest dlc very reminiscent to bo1 s resurrection dlc which is great the campaign however was a letdown i was hoping it would continue from one of the endings in bo2 to clear up what looked like a cliffhanger raul menendez grinning at the very end of one of the endings evokes he still has something up his sleeve would i recommend this game no but it would be a yes only during a sale though and if the season pass ever drops price significantly
