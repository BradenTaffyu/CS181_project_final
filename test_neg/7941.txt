2022 amazing game with stunning graphics and sound that s it that s all the positive aspects i can think of i was really disappointed with the game in the lack of pve servers rare hasn t considered that there are two player bases in this game the ones who like to farm who find enjoyment in pve and overall to enjoy a pirate game their way but there s also the player base who are thirsty for blood and find their fun in pvp and indirectly ruin the fun of others who aren t in to pvp this game has completely neglected the player base that enjoy pve and for that reason you are forced to become good at pvp to play this game despite some players hating pvp i see absolutely no fun in grinding for hours and enjoying those hours to end up getting looted by another ship and essentially wasting all that time you spent where exacty do you get the motivation to do it again i have absolutely no idea the player decides what is fun if there are two different types of fun in the game then split the game to make those types separate in other words make a pvp server and pve server and sure i ve seen arguments saying that s it s a pvp game hints why it s called sea of thieves but what if someone wants to play this game because it looks like a cool pirate game but can t because that person isn t in to pvp you see the problem the verdict is if you like to fight other players by all means this game is for you but if you want a relaxing pirate game without any worry of players killing you do not get this game get ac black flag instead
