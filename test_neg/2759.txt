2017 steam says i have 352 hours on gtav gtao considering i ported my character over from xbox 360 it should be at least double that so lets say 700 hours i have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game yet i cannot recommend it yes i have had some of the best gaming i ve ever had with this game i thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign i played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside i even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card i was there for the dns glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur and i was there when they cut literally everyone s funds to 500 000 as a fix but one day i was playing and some guy joins the server forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him freezes us and makes bags of money rain from the sky don t get me wrong i m not stupid i know people hack and people give out money i ve seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc i ve generally ignored them but this guy didn t give me much of a choice regardless once i figured out what was happening i left the server i didn t want the money in my bank so i blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up a couple hours later i was temporarily banned and my character was reset i lost all of my cars including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched not to mention the majority of that 700 hours i d put into having a character i liked rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me my ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim there was no way for me to voice my displeasure to rockstar no appeals process for them to hear my case check the evidence and see my innocence that was several months ago i uninstalled the game and let it go i m only writing this now so that others can see what they re getting into yes as i ve said this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content from an objective standpoint its very good value for money and the free regular dlc is a nice touch what ruins all of that is the way rockstar treats its customers there s no consistency and no compassion i know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they ve never had any trouble yet it happens to me once without my consent and i get temp banned and lose literally everything what motivation is there to play legitimately then if people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision and those who don t can get away with it indefinitely hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience rockstar if you actually end up reading this please start treating your customers with some compassion don t assume we re all hackers
