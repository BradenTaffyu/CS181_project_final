2015 i can t recommend this right now because of the scummy business practices that rockstar are currently employing as you have probably read it is impossible to get a real discount on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount not only does mean that the game isn t really on a discount it also means that you probably won t be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it i preorded this game before it came out but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it i would probably wait until this is over hopefully rockstar will see how angry the steam community is about this and sort it out until then i would suggest waiting the game itself is enjoyable for the most however but i can t suggest it until rockstar sort this out
