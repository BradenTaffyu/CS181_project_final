this game is a quality game for sure but the people behind it have done some straight bs the single save bars you from a new game as if it were tempting clueless people into buying into the micro transactions added the first thing you see on startup are a wad of micro sells that were def hidden b4 release it is easy to see how they can add more crap to what is there and considering the removed classes and skills from the old game it would be lousy if they tried to add it in late individually also the crappy character creator didnt even link to the upgraded steam version i bought so 3 presets lost just to waste time remaking wondering if i can handle teh game which thankfully i can all in all the game is quality and worth it but the tactics out the gate without even getting through the game on top of not being to restart without editing files this game needs all the negative press so they lose all faith in trying crap like this ever again 2 hours ini had to wonder why i am not even playing the game and it is because im debating restarting again because my pawns voice feels so off that said i realized the game story feels dry especially when the black guy meets you his dialogue feels extremely underwhelming for what he is telling you in what seems like the main story the progression feels too fast as well where as someone who played the old games dlc as mystic knight im wondering what the incentive challenge late game will be to keep a shield playstyle the boons are stripped and the vocation abilities arent all that great like 1 per class i care to cross with others that again the first game had way more experimentation in overall i m realizing this game was stripped on purpose to be designed like a mmo with dlc it legit plays like an mmo under the guise of a series and i guranteed it would be effective to cash grab an asian base with how openly recieved the mmo mentality is the level ups dont feel as rewardig as the first game and i m really struggling to see the point of late game progression the game was never hard because of fights it s a gear based game with an rpg layer but they stripped a large chunk of the rpg layer and made gear partially a dlc thing this really is a good game butchered with moronic greed they could have just releashed proper dlcs later and it would of been better off but instead they stripped the game and sold quality of life out the gate knowing the game felt like a grindy mmo
