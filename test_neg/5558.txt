2018 been playing since year one appearantly ubisoft realized that they actually made an okay game that wasn t complete trash and decided to remedy that immediatly wouldn t want to ruin their perfect track record after all eh the game has gone from a nice tactical slow paced shooter to a mindless twich shooter with speed prioritized over all else and actual gadget usage replaced with hold f to gain advantage skills while less important you can visually see the degradation of the game as time progresses through lazy character and weapon design and a decreasing attention to detail ubisoft has also decided that they weren t milking the playerbase hard enough and have increased the ammount of microtransaction for cosmetics cosmetics that focus more on wacky zany headgear and cool emotes xd instead of the tactical realistic cosmetic options they keep promising are coming while this also ties into poor communication and community management ubisoft decided the solution to community complaints about the seemingly arbitrary costs of cosmetics is to harmonize the costs upwards so everything just costs more unless you want to shell out some money for some rainbowbucks despite making several promises to have better and more transparent communication with the community ubisoft continues to fail in this aspect making dumb decisions about the direction of the game and handwaving things away with cop out excuses like data limits technical limitations or stating one thing in official releases then editing it and pretending they never said those things in the first place lastly the community doesn t have a toxicity problem it has a moron problem the only toxic part of the communtiy is the drooling idiots who defend ubisoft s dumb decisions the degradation of the game and roll over on ubisoft s command like little lapdogs yipping we gotta support the game the devs aren t bad i went to the invitation and touched one praise lord chanka xd you had a good thing going ubisoft had edit a comment asked me to review the game not ubisoft i suppose that s a fair request i gave a very shallow summary of things in the original review so i suppose i ll go in more depth about the gameplay forewarning i m not a reviewer and some of this may be more ranty than i anticipated a big complaint i have is that we re now entering year three and ubisoft still hasn t figured out what to do about balancing speed versus armor in a game that prioritizes one shot headshots and guns with high rpms the bonus of being able to take one additional bullet or slip away with 1 hp for three armor operators is not worth being a slow and sluggish one speed like i mentioned in the original review there s becoming a bigger and bigger emphasis on speed and it s become more and more obvious that having more speed is flat out better than having more armor this can be observed by ubisoft balancing old operators like kapkan and blitz by making them faster blitz went from being a meme pick to death incarnate just by being faster it s also apparent in that out of the 18 dlc operators released after the game s launch only echo and mira are 3 armor still waiting on that echo rework change you said was in the works ubi while five have been three speeds with the rest being average 2 2 operators you can t even really make the argument that 3 armor is used as a bad thing to balance out ops like how fuze has good guns good gadgets and a good unique gadget in exchange for being 3 armor because it took half a year for ubisoft to nerf ela who had 3 speed a great gun good gadgets and a good unique gadget to simply having a good gun and okay gadgets there s also seemingly been a change in operator selection i ve seen over time back in red crow and velvet shell when i still thought the game was fun and enjoyable there were more people who played support tactical operators and wanted to coordinate a breach make our way to the site and either secure plant extract now operator selection seems to be prioritized on both attack and defense by what operator kills stuff deader now hardly anyone plays thermite over hibanna because even though thermite s gadget is better for breaching hibanna has better guns people pick twitch not because they want to gather intel and disable gadgets but because the famas is really good her drone nerf made this worse it was going on before that though iq despite having her gadget finally be more useful due to the increase of gadgets it can detect really only gets played because she s 3 speed has good guns grenades and is waifubait the list goes on and on was a lot of this going on back in the good ol days of red crow velvet shell yeah has it gotten worse more widespread since then yeah i ve got a myriad of other complaints reasons why i personally don t like the game anymore but those are more matters of personal preference hell i d wager that right now somebody is reading this and going uhhhhh acktually youtuber x and pro leaguer y said that anyone who complains about things is just bad mkay that s great good for you the average player however doesn t see or experience the same stuff as someone who only plays high level matches with premade squads and advanced coordination and shockingly has a different experience with the game
