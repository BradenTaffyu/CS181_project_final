2016 call of duty is one of the many games fps related that i play you cant exactly contrast the game with other fps games are they have different play styles most of the time call of duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on well thats what it seems like to me the game is good dont get me wrong it is enjoyable to play but there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button 1 what the game has become the days of being able to use other weapons in game is over being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an lmg or sniper is no longer a play style that can be used there was nothing that i loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on dom instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style 2 rush i can understand that call of duty is a fast fps game one of the easiest to play in that matter you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like battlefield you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots sniper ghost warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it both black ops 2 ghost and aw i dont own aw but from friends that have the game are saturated with the use of smgs and or shotguns having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a sniper almost obselete lmg users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high dmg smgs you find in bo3 yet when it comes to balancing things 3 how to guide balancing weapons after using the haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that i do not understand somehow it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage yet fires a buckshot like most of the shotguns in bo3 i am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon note most of the people that are hating on me get to close you see treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between balance and butthurt balance is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the haymaker the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone simple as that but when balancing weapons also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from this could be from places like reddit youtube etc once you read these comments actually take some time to look at statistics i am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing smgs with have the range of a sniper im not just saying this because i get killed byt smgs quite a lot but more so that it is true for example if you look at say the vesper chuck rapid fire laser sight and fast mag you pretty much has a lightweight minigun there are positives to the game the zombies is spot on i love it have enjoyed every single moment of it especially when you disconnect from singleplayer multiplayer although has a fair amount of issues is fun but my main complaint for the game is the constant fps spikes stutters any kind of help i look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer i have updated the drivers which had pretty much no effect what so ever getting a better computer well i think i have good enough specks to be honest i7 2600 hd7950 and 8gb ram dont you find it sad how supposedly creating a sequal to what was quite a good game black ops 2 take such a downfall games are meant for enjoyment being able to communicate with friends and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother dont you feel dissapointed in your inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50 of the comments reviews on the game are negative i know this will most likely not been seen by the eyes of any treyarch developer but all these questions run through my mind the thing is what goes through yours
