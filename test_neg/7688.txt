2022 if im being honest i love this game but it has one major short coming that sucks the fun out of it the fact that there s no pve servers i play solo most of the time and ill just admit it i suck at pvp i cant tell you how many times ive spent 3 to 4 hours completing a quest only to have all my progress erased by a team of reapers who dont even take the loot they just camp it until it despawns if they ever ad a pve only option i will gladly play again
