2021 update game is still bad review subject to change the core game is fun and great to play nice mix with melee ranged combat strategy feels well done the movement is not clunky and the combat for the most part is pretty fluent the character editor is fun and of course the cosmetics are nice ive logged many hours in this game and can really see what needs adjustments we will start with the extremely high ping players playing in ranked matches this needs a cap on ping as i am sure you have read many complaints about the chinese players using vpn and zerging the us servers which makes the game vary unpopular no one wants to try to swing in a melee game at a target you can not actually hit this makes for a vary big issue in a br game this game favors high ping players instead of forcing the high ping player to be locked in place to catch up to the server they instead just let them run wild and hit at any target they see dealing damage to them even if they are not actually at that current location if you try to swing at them and hit them your attacks phase through their body so as you can see why all the top players are chinese second off the weapons and heroes need much balancing as i am sure most people have noticed being grappled hook stun spammed this could easily be fixed by disabling auto lock on melee and hooks in ranked play this in turn would make the game more skill based and the engagements more interesting instead of being grapple stunned for people to long sword slash spam you heroes such as need some work his 150m range grab not only needs to be much sorter id say about the range of a grapple hook with 50 range and it also needs a cool down 5 8 seconds you could give him a small aoe ground pound to make up for the cd wait time long sword slash needs much fine tuning the katana stun lock needs some work the spears whirlwind attack needs some adjusting as well ect ect with the map itself its fun its interesting enough the issue is with the way the character grabs onto ever little thing and you tend to get stuck on it some objects such as small rocks need better clip nodes so the characters and step over them a bit easier instead of just coming to a full stop and then getting stuck as far as the way players are playing the game it is a bit toxic due to the game rewarding those players that hide all game to reach the top 5 in trios and 3 in solos instead of just displaying giving larger amounts of exp for kills and damage dealt the reward those for hiding and reaching top 5 i can understand hiding in ranked anyways because no one wants to fight high ping chinese players because you can not hit them anyways i could easily point out many issues with this game that need to be adjusted for smooth and fun game play but i will sit back and see what the next update has in store if they get rid of auto locking melee and grapples from ranked its ok in qm lock the ping to keep the ping abusers out you know who you are and re balance some of the heroes weapons i would be not only thrilled with this but would give this a positive review as i am sure a lot of you would as well
