2015 i recommend the game it s a solid port however while i appreciate rockstar s effort take two is absolutely not a trustworthy company for pc gamers so in addition to stringing along the pc community for years since gta v s announcement the countless absurd delays and now the summer sale price gouging everyone s missing that all those bundles they re packaging with gta v they re non refundable because they go straight to rockstar s service it took them days to decide to abuse and circumvent valve s refund service days you may have finally made a solid pc port rockstar but unfortunately your publisher is absolutely f cking with things any person or company with a shred of morality would not be f cking with edit oh and now take two has decided mods are illegal because that s always gone over so well
