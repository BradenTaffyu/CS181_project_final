2015 i do not write many reviews for games probably because i do not figure that anyone would read them but i feel i have to say something about the newest offering in the call of duty franchise it is not what the hype made it out to be maybe if you are a console player it may have redeeming qualities but as far as a solid pc fps i say no you may ask why keyser would you say such nonsense you love cod well to be honest it is like this 1 if cod ghosts and tianfall had a child it would be named black ops 3 2 you have to make your gameing rig jump through hoops and perform magical tricks to get it to run then if it makes it through the connecting phase you have to become the great sherlock holmes to find the graphical settings to make it not look like absolute and hold frames so it is not an animated flipbook 3 your mouse will do crazy things 4 hate to say but advanced warfare is much better than bo3 there is a clunkiness to all movements and hit detection is a joke aw has much more customization and a better prestige ladder 5 oh you like hard core modes gtfo and wank in a corner yes tdmhc has the wait to respawn mechanic and hcdom has been totally omitted thank you for removing my favorite game mode treyarch i would refund for the deluxe package but i made the mistake of giving this game a chance maybe they can patch the crap out of it as is the norm with all modern pc games they like to sell unfinished products and string along the consumer taunting fixes for something that should have been right to start if we are going to pay 100 for something make sure it is good and deserving of our hard earned dosh and by the way before you go off on a this is a console port rant aren t the games made on a pc to start with so shouldnt it function properly on a pc and what kind of 1 off pc do they test these things on they use the latest tech and nvidia amd offerings which most of the gaming base does not have access to purchase if you think you have the best pc evar and like call of duty games otherwise go get fallout 4 i m finished with this review for now if you would like to leave me a message or your thoughts on anything i mentioned here feel free have a great day after two months of playing around with settings and patches updates being released i wanted to update this review and say thatblack ops 3 is redeeming its self but i have to say the game is now what it should have been on realease i should not have to buy a un finished game and then hope it gets patched down the line as i said before if you like the cod series purchase and carry on update finally i am happy to say that everything i have mentioned previously has been pretty much taken care of i do reccomend this game especially if you are a fan of the cod series
