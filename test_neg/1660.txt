2022 i ve logged more than 2 300 hours with warhammer ii and as it stands i m struggling to understand how i m going to get anything near that in what is almost certainly the ultimate release of the warhammer franchise in the total war mould ca are effectively asking you to hand over a tidy little sum for what is a triple a title and don t appear to have bothered to create a game at all rather a promise to make a game anyone who is remotely familiar with this franchise knows that it s the game s sandbox campaign mode where the fun actually begins this is made worse when you realise that in order to get the full complete total war warhammer experience at the hypothetical end newcomers to the franchise will be presented with this thing and asked to pay for two more complete games with two very average campaigns and effectively the same smaller sandbox in order to have it it s no lie now that modders have effectively prolonged the wh2 experience well beyond its intended shelf life this popularity combined with ca s buy all three for the best experience attitude to marketing once looked like a commitment to the creation of a fantastic world and a beautiful product and now looks a lot like hucksterism ca a substantial developer should not be relying on the creative talent and passion of people to improve their game for free in order to squeeze out as much length out of the wh franchise as possible i know many of us are waiting for immortal empires in the hope that wh3 will become an experience worth having and there s no doubt it will improve things substantially but let s face it it has no where else to go the campaign in this instalment is the laziest ever ca clearly knows why people bought this title because most of us who play wh are completionists and will patiently wait for what is effectively the wh sandbox to arrive and then spend hundreds and thousands of hours enjoying it but i think we all know now that it s not because ca have created amazing story driven campaign experiences the vortex campaign was about as forgettable but because the modding community is so passionate so committed and so much more detail oriented than the studio itself that ca knows it will get a lot more commerciality out of a franchise that frankly doesn t deserve it if we re being honest i sunk 50 or so hours this week into wh3 because i had covid and had nothing else to do i will play it again when ie finally launches still cannot understand why that doesn t ship at launch as well but the reason i will stay with wh like i did with wh2 is because of our modding community so make sure you give them some love subscribe to their patreons where they have them but most of all treat this franchise with the cynicism it actually deserves especially if you re new to it
