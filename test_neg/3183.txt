2016 pre ordered this game straight away when it first came to steam been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total i had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the x80 prot car or whatever it s called a 1 week ban i made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply waited for the ban to disappear to go in again then i notice all my money is gone they wipe your account when you get a ban so i started playing a heist with my brother and some friends on the last part of the heist i got another ban for 1 month i still don t know what it is i am doing that s against their rules i make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all i get are bot replies after a while i manage to do a ticket with the title connectivity issues and explained that i was afraid to log in cus i didn t want another ban and this time i get a reply from a person this person said we do not know the reason since it s a bot that s banning people and calmly said but you shouldn t be afraid to log in i trusted this guy so i logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day however on the next day i started playing i got a permanent ban and i still have no clue whatsoever what i got banned for talked with some guys in a gta group and they said i will most likely not get unbanned note i was not modding cheating or abusing anything in the game at all pure vanilla version of the game end note the game is very fun to play with friends but their anti cheat system bans people for nothing and the support gives no whatsoever to help or explain what might be the issue if you can look past the risk of getting randomly banned and having cheaters nuking you anywhere in the world then you might have a good time i don t recommend it cus i think rockstar don t deserve the money when they clearly don t give a about their community
