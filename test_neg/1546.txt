2022 this is a bit of a sad review because it s nearly an incredibly good game nearly every aspect of the game is far improved on warhammer 1 and 2 but with a few very noteable downgrades that ruin the experience entirely because of this i ll only list my complaints uithe ui was intentionally downgraded for some reason in tw1 and tw2 it was much clearer what was build built and destroyed recruited and disbanded because it was highlighted in green or red for some reason everything in this game is red possibly to try and distinguish itself from the other games but as a result its a lot less readable performancefor me performance is okayish looks great but the benchmarks for the prerelease had much much higher frames they were slashed significantly for release some even by half and many are speculating denuvo is the causecrashesi have completed one campaign and i have crashed easily 40 times in 20 hours of play most of this is only when you tab out but with a multi monitor set up its extremely unstable and more than half of those crashes resulted in me having to restart my pc completely campaignthis part is the most fixable but also the most egregious issue with the game while nearly every part of the campaign mechanics and battles is extremely high quality and fun the main campaign the realms of chaos is not fun it seems specifically designed to not be fun why the game will spawn portals all over the map which cause massive corruption spread and eventually spawn doomstacks that come out and roam around they can either be killed with an army theyre defended by 20 units or deleted for a fee of 1500 with an agent this means around turn 150 i had 15 of these portals in my lands playing whack a mole for them all is extremely time consuming boring and punishing it dictates how you play entirely the realms themselves are even worse you have to enter 4 to win the game they re extremely time consuming and offer no rewards one rewards you essentially for failing it others give you some minor stuff rarely but its not really a reward in fact completing them punishes you by spawning more and more enemies in the world you need to complete this for the victory but its so agonising heres what you have to do for all 4 slaaneshtake 10 or so turns just walking through portals at the end kill a big boss at any time if you leave you get given massive rewards the most thematic and cool of all of them but still a pain similar fight to khorne mentioned later khornekinda agony kill things capture a thing then defend it repeat three times takes a very long time 1 2 hours and really burns you out its really not clear where enemies will come from and you can get wiped easily by not deploying properlynurgleyou re in a plane that you constantly take damage in have to walk around and pick up gifts to survive longer then big fight at the end takes a long time but the fastest and most punishing of the 4tzeenchi don t know who made this place but thematically its on point a literal confusing hellscape you get lost and tormented in its completely rng boring and frustrating all 4 realms everything you interact with essentially takes your turn away its made even worse where in this realm you have to interact with teleporters that may or may not take you where you want to go basically its a good game but has a handful of smaller issues but all of that is overshadowed by the mammoth that is the campaign its so poorly designed anti fun and frustrating i would never recommend it to anyone pick it up when they rework remove it or when they add immortal empires realms of chaos is not worth your time
