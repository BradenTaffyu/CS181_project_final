as a long time warframe and destiny player i was very interested in this game unfortunately it fails to deliver lackluster storymode is followed up by hard mode with slightly increased drop rates at the cost of drastically inflated boss health and some additional mechanics trash fodder remains inconsequential the endgame loop consists of acquiring relics or amorphous material then either doing a designated colossi fight or farming for other materials to summon an open world mini boss other players may assist in the latter but will not receive any rewards unless they too have the same specific material cost once either boss type is defeated players use their relic and roll from a pool of rewards with incremental rarities fail to receive the part you wanted start the process over again which may take 20 30 mins unlike in warframe players cannot run identical relics and choose from the pool to increase the chances of a rare component additionally loot is individualized if a player receives a drop such as a relic the other players may not if a party is grinding together for a specific part it could take hours for everyone to get the item and move on once again in warframe that is not the case if a specific item drops it drops for the whole party character progression is severely strained by the fact that the ability to increase a character or weapon s mod capacity is locked behind low drop rates for specific blueprints while the blueprint to craft an item that halves the cost of a mod slot is only a 15 drop the blueprint to increase mod capacity by 20 is locked behind a 3 drop while players receive two of each component during the story mission it is not enough to expand a full loadout to tackle the hard mode bosses unless one is lucky to have these blueprints drop regularly players are forced to shell out 20 each by comparison a warframe orokin catalyst reactor increased mod capacity is worth 0 80 usd and a bundle of three forma mod cost reduction is worth 1 40 usd regarding customization the attractive characters are off put by the lack of customization many parts cannot be shaded by the one time use or rather locked to one character s outfit on use dye system default skins and ultimate skins cannot be died only the premium outfits can be understandable that a game at launch would lack a good number of outfit choices but the accessories also leave much to be desired a slice of pizza hanging off a character s chest isn t often an optimal look for many players nor is a tombstone shaped storage box which cannot be dyed an item may people will want to wear finally the gameplay itself feels floaty i ve shot headshots with a handcannon where i had no right to because the reticle was miles from an enemy s dome other times when using a sniper rifle i ll miss headshots that were clearly on target enemies flinch and twitch frequently like a possessed 12 year old during an exorcism further increasing the frustration of precise aiming players are also limited to 4 players per zone and enemies are only populated when one begins a mission except for the one three man patrol that wanders around and harasses any player attempting to clear space in their inventory ultimately the first descendant is a great looking game with incredible promise but leaves players with a merciless grindfest without any endgame activities to warrant such a grind i would recommend waiting this out to see what the devs can do to address the quality of life and gameplay loop
