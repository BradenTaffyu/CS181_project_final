2023 i knew that most corporations were woke but i played games to escape most of that now cod has gone and thrust it in everyone s face i have uninstalled and recommend that everyone do that same stand up to this ridiculous crap in terms of gameplay its mediocre at best its just the basic same game re skinned yet again this is why they pump them out every year the game you have from 2007 is the same game here just a different look but the same general premise they leave game bugs alone that hurts the player and patch anything that benefits quickly its the same stuff across the industry i actually had some fun with dmz and that was the only thing i could have recommended but the recent nick mercs issue solidified my uninstall and exit i respect peoples opinions and i recognize that everyone has one the fact that cod would go after someone for an opinion is telling of the world we live in i want no part of this game or company from this point forward
