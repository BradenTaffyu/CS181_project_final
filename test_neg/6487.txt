summary probably one of the worst games ive ever played horribly imbalanced and hardly any of the players adhere to the unwritten rules why even have unwritten rules just balance the game yeah the developers do not know how to balance a game and only make it worse with each update i swear every time i come back to the game it has gotten worselet me list out the reasons why this game sucks because why not this game needs serious help imbalanced for most players who havent played for 1000 hours skill based matchmaking does not exist like seriously i have less than 200 hours and i often get put against people with over 1k playing as survivor is a death wish if you aren t full stacking the players are horribly toxic especially killers which is laughable since they already have the upper hand instead of balancing the game the devs expect you to follow the unwritten rules which i ve noticed less and less people doing the fact that unwritten rules exist at all public matches are the most unfun experiences you will ever have as a survivor unless you like the feeling of panicking every 15 seconds in which case go for it there s probably a lot more but these are the ones that come to mind firstand heres the reason why i even come back to this game cool characters collabs but there is a catch to that positive comment the devs are just too greedy collab after collab i m sure they re raking in the cash keep in mind this is already a paid game and yet still cant manage to balance their game besides like 5 survivors and killers the rest of them all require you to pay that or grind for hours upon hours to make enough shards to buy just one here s hoping you haven t lost your sanity by then listen i m all for devs getting paid well i m one myself so i get it but i dont think you deserve to be paid well if you re just squeezing the game for every penny i know it costs to do collabs and all but at this point the game s too far gone to justify putting any more development cash into collabs and characters the love that should be put into a game like this just doesnt exist i mean if you really loved your game you d be able to find out how to balance it at least enough for it to not be noticeable every game for everyone not just the players with 1k hours i got this game to play with my friends and even then i just can t find it fun at this point every game we get into now is just a cycle of tunneling camping and slugging by killers with multiple times more hours than us im guessing a fair share of the positive recommendations are coming from people who play killer like that so just ignore thempersonally i refuse to support this game any more i used to and i regret it and that s why i wrote this review i rarely write reviews unless a game is especially good or bad and unfortunately this game falls into the especially bad side
