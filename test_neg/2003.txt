2023 i actually really like the game yet it feels like the game doesnt like us there s plenty of hackers that are being ignored the lack of players is astonishing you either play with bots or someone with a chinese letters name who destroys you in like a second probably because only people who are high rank and play this game non stop are the only ones left and the lags bugs are notorious there are characters who are completely useless solo and characters that are just overpowered and can go 1v3 and still win it s a mess here and it s a shame because apart from it all it s a really beautiful game with amazing customization and skins wish that the free version launch brought the game back to life but it didn t not even the nier collab did it
