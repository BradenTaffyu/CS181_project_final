2020 if you are looking for all of you work that you put into something and worked for to just be thrown away by some people who just want to ruin your day then this game is for you but if you are a player who enjoys fighting ai ships gigant megalodons dangerous krakens and just want to enjoy a nice well build world with an amazing scenery and some of the best water textures you will see in games at the time while hunting for treasure and having over all a great time well then i am sorry because the first thing talked about in this review is what you will get because the main part of the commuity in this game doesn t care about if you have anything worth taking they will just chase you down and spawn kill you unitll you uninstall this game there will also most likely never be a pve server because the devs are listening to the players who play the game the most and those would be the toxic player hunters who will call you the n word and a b ch untill you no loger play the game and if anyone ever tells you that a pve server would ruin the game because then people would only play on those servers doesn t that just prove the point and if someone tells you that people would get bored of only doing pve then those people have cleary never played any singleplayer game or a an open world exploring game
