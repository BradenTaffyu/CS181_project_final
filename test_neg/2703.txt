2018 like many others i poured hundreds of hours into building my empire online only to have literally all of my funds removed from the game entirely this is after buying the edition that gives you 1 350 million to start with rockstar accused me of cheating by association from being in a game where modders frivolously threw out cash or added in game money to my account sadly they removed every dollar i earned ingame including the ones i payed for and left my account with 0 guilty by association i suppose what a waste of time and a poor way to treat your customers
