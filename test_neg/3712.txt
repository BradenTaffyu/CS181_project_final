2017 grand theft auto 5 is a great game if you like to grind or mindlessly drive around killing random people with friends or plan heists and succesfully complete them however the reason i doe not reccomend the game is because it turned into a complete grind to be able to afford cool items in the game you need to spend insane ammounts of time to get cool stuff and they ve started banning alot fo people innocent players too still the weapons vehicles and missions are awesome but rockstar 2k is not consumer friendly anymore
