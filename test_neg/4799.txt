2022 can t recommend this game with the scummy business practices activision is committing right now my friend was permanently banned on launch day for what reason you ask verifying the integrity of his game cache using the built in steam tool upon appeal it was reviewed by not actual people i m sure and the ban remains permanent for now mw2 devs haven t recognized the bug yet but there s no way in hell they didn t know about this considering this was happening during the campaign early access as well there s nothing more scummy than raising your game s prices by 10 making your customers pay for it and then permanently banning them while leaving a ban on record onto your steam account absolutely shameless do not give this company money
