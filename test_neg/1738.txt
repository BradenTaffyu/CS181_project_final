2023 edit ca has taken the community feedback to heart and thrones of decay is looking to be a major improvement on the previous dlc if the support for this continues in this fashion after the thrones of decay release i will change my review but i am holding off until then rocky launch and questionable decisions regarding long term support caused the community to run off goodwill alone that ca built over many years predatory dlc pricing policy broke the camels back and made it clear that it was only worse from here i can t recommend this even with sales without drastic changes to the on going support of this game
