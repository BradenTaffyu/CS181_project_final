2022 this is a frustrating release and a shame because its game play is excellent but it s technical performance is woeful for every high that it offers like the thrill of exploration and the joy of slick combat there s the lows of frame rates plummeting far beyond any weaknesses of your hardware since every version including the consoles or beefy pc s has stutter and serious hitches i m running this on lower specs than the minimum hardware and yet after a driver update that got rid of intrusive graphical glitches it s fairly smooth running this with high settings they don t seem to be that much of a burden on the gpu and even a 970 is capable of running some hefty outdoors scenes at between 45 to 60 frames a second indoors can be pretty much a smooth 60 fps but with very little happening onscreen it will tank to the low 40 s and on occasion plunge into the 20 s undoubtedly some of this is my hardware but it will drop with very little going on and since this is known across the board clearly something is fundamentally wrong with the engine performance seems like it should be fixable in time so this negative review is purely a reflection of it s current state it is far worse than any of their other games and whilst it may be their response to a security problem discovered in their engine if so it s had a disastrous effect on how it handles if you persist with the game as i have well it is generally playable and it is a great evolution of the dark souls template the world is huge but lacking in lore this isn t a skyrim type experience where you meet npc s and they talk your ear off with tales of how they took an arrow to the knee verbal exposition isn t a big thing hereelden ring is a third person combat rpg that is less focused on it s narrative and quests than more talkative titles like the witcher 3 if you re familiar with dark souls this is a tweak and refinements to that experience in a much less linear manner than before the open world is a quite liberating element for me if you re unfamiliar it s a responsive but measured mixture of melee and ranged options with the player free to mix and match how they progress in a world that s a big playground for your skills with the only limitation being that levelling up becomes harder and harder and your proficiency in combat will be limited by your stamina or how much magic you can cast or number of arrows crossbow bolts etc further tweaking of your weapons and armour can also boost your capabilities so paying attention to what you have in your inventory is a big part to survival it rewards choice and whilst it lacks depth mechanically whatever build you make it doesn t really change the fact that most bosses are just simple combo s but hit really hard it is very engaging trying to unravel it you roam in one one direction and some beast or neer do well kicks your arse so you travel elsewhere and some other beast or neer do well kicks your arse and so on and so on until you come across something where you think to yourself i m taking you down and maybe just maybe you prevail and can start to level up once various abilities are learned or obtained by defeating bosses it starts to flow more smoothly chipping away here and there to get enhancements and then going back to some gargantuan fiend that smushed you in one hit before and now you can have an epic battle that gets the adrenaline flowing rather than getting instantly squashed like an insignificant bug that feeling is great but you have to work to achieve it you have to explore to find it s surprises and secrets and often you will be left to figure out things for yourself which will either be great if you re a free thinker or bad i guess if you want your hand held and not to have to think when the game opens up there is probably the best smoothest example of this genre to date every facet of it s game play is fine tuned and beautifully executed the tragedy is that the game really handles poorly enough albeit on occasion that it undoes the otherwise solid level of performance there are times when tons of stuff is onscreen and it has no issue then you can be walking down a corridor of a self contained area and the frame rate falls off a cliff for seemingly no reason i honestly think that even with my 970 this will eventually see a patch possibly when they can remove easy anticheat from being needed that will see a much more stable game as it really feels like it ought to be better since the game isn t that much of a looker or doing stuff that other games couldn t manage at higher frame rates compared to other open world titles like mad max rage 2 the witcher 3 even monster hunter world which was dubious itself this struggles keeping up my expectation is that will change but for now as disappointing as it is no recommended despite it being goty material when these problems are hopefully fixed it is a great game and also a bad one for those who are made of sterner stuff it is still quite playable but no hardware no matter how powerful will resolve it s performance issues
