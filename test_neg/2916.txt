2017 only worth buying for the story and if you have friends to play with public servers are impossible to enjoy due to cheaters hackers everywhere also almost everyone you meet online is just looking for a fight and or a way to annoy you to no end it s also excessively grindy you don t unlock all weapons clothing and cosmetics until lvl 100 and you re very limited when you first start money is painful to obtain too so if you don t have time you may want to just buy shark cards so you can start with millions and actually have a little fun game 9 10community 2 10
