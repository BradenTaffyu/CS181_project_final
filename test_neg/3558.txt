2018 i m reviewing the online portion of the game offline is little bit more down coming from gta 4 this game is a joke who asked for grindy missions nobody who asked for npcs with aimbot nobody who asked for flying cars from saints row nobody i m pretty sure i bought gta not saints row or a remade version of clash royale because this game you buy your way up unless you want to sit down all day for the rest of your life trying to afford the guns that a gamers have aka missile strike mark2 flying bike with missiles and the deluxo cancer the online portion of the game was horribly made it s just there so they can make money however the only fun i find is just messing around on freemode with friends i m glad they gave a shot at a new online having purpose then just freemode like gta4 but they just keep adding dlc that costs to much and doesn t give much in return offline campaigni found it to be pretty good but not as good as the previous game i was hoping for more firefight missions but for most of the game it felt like drive here then drive here then drive here all across the map i think that was just done to extend the play time of the game however the map is beautiful and there are plenty of things to do and explore like side missions strangers and freaks and hidden areas overall i give this game 5 10 online offline good i guess i d be playing gta 4 but rockstar doesn t like to fix good games i guess
