2023 i ve always enjoyed pirate themed games and stories it s one of my favorite aesthetics i remember reading about sea of thieves back in 2018 shortly after it first came out and i thought the game looked absolutely smashing i was quickly dissuaded from the game however as so many reviews mentioned the brutal no choice pvp nature of the game and at times toxic nature of the community especially with me not being very good at pvp and having slow reaction times cut forward to two months ago when a friend convinced me to buy the game after showing me how many pve activities there are and just how fun and interesting the world is my starting experience was getting destroyed by a 4 person galleon minutes after completing the tutorial and joining the larger world no problem right that happens i ll just continue on life after life ship after ship crews and ships of 2 3 people more than myself show no hesitation in destroying my ship and occasionally shouting rude comments in the process running or fighting the result is the same i got to about 50 hrs of gameplay with my largest streak of not getting killed being about 4 hours it was promising when rare announced safer seas as a non pvp mode but as they will cap reputation and offer reduced treasure in this mode 30 rewards it is clear they only intend safer seas to be an extended tutorial ptr i know there are other people like me who just want to play this beautiful and fun game without pvp and would happily buy things from the store to support the development of the game overall however currently and even with the proposed safe seas mode people not interested in pvp are being treated as second class players by the develoopers
