2022 casual players beware this game is not for you your gaming session is going to be at least a few hours depending on the other players in your server you may have an unproductive and frustrating few hours pvp is highly predatory and presents a serious impediment to casual new and especially solo players harassment and verbal abuse from other players abound i recommend turning off the voice and chat options for younger gamers the game has a ton of pve content from exploration to incredible world building and quest content you could spend hundreds of hours alone on that portion of the game for many players this a big draw and reminds me of my nights spent on melee island as guybrush threepwood even the pirate villages at night look like the islands of that famed franchise some of the shortcomings of the quest tall tales system could probably be fixed with a few tweaks like more frequent checkpoints and some way to disincentivize other players from targeting questers which brings me to this game s biggest issue pvp new players solo players and pve players are fodder for the pvp crowd if you re a casual player with not much time to invest in a game and you plan to play solo i suggest avoiding this game the game has a bit of an identity crisis that i frankly think puts off both pve and pvp players from the pvp perspective with only 4 5 ships per server it s hard to find other players to pvp when you finally do come across someone they often have no interest in a battle this leads to pvp players attacking anyone they come across regardless of whether there s anything to be gained likewise from the pve perspective constantly having your progress set back by a pvp attack can be frustrating because the world is large and travel between islands time consuming you may lose hours of work most players we encountered as new players were needlessly hostile only a few recognized that we were new and those encounters were very friendly during some gaming sessions we found ourselves in a server with cool chill people who just wanted to go about their business questing and exploring one person asked first before engaging in pvp those were really refreshing encounters but few and far between some people justify their behavior by screaming about how it s a pirate game and pirates were jerks so it s ok if they re jerks too pirates also had scurvy and syphilis so how serious are you about this piracy thing folks
