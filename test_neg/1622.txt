2023 three generations of this game and the ai hasn t improved a single bit three generations spanning nearly a decade and the game still suffers from the same ai pathfinding clipping and other issues playing battles in this game is not fun i find myself autoresolving every time not because i lose battles because i don t but the amount of i have to deal with to go through a fight ranged units not shooting for no reason invisible walls in ridiculous locations elevation being disregarded units freezing and refusing to do anything units glitching under walls and unable to move or fight units randomly losing leadership on a winning battle in a battle they are winning decisively no enemy ability was used and they were not summoned units dwarf heroes and characters being completely broken rules being applied to you that are not applied to the ai for artificial difficulty i m refusing to recommend this game and any further expansions or iterations will continue to be badly reviewed unless they make this game actually fun to play i can steam roll every campaign almost effortlessly the difficulty only determines how angry the ai s ridiculous bonuses will make me before the ai will never get smarter only more anti player they will never strategize only cheat what s that you have units that are completely hidden and half of your army is visible the ai will always send forces towards your invisible units even if they are on the other side of the map not to fight them or anything just to block their way the ai cheating is long known and there s plenty of mods to fix that but it s ridiculous that i can give this game to any 12 years old and he can play better than any ai if you completely remove the code from any ai in the game that gives them bonuses and preferred treatment the game would be toddler level it s ridiculous that three generations of this game and nothing s changed other than the ui get wrecked
