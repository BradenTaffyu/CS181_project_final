2020 imagine having such an awesome game foundation and then screwing it up by keeping it as dull as possible no ship upgrades no character upgrades one branch of common enemy skeletons each and every mission plays out exactly the same and don t get you anywhere except give you more gold which you can exchange for cosmetics only so basically you grind for cosmetics and you sail to grief other players because there s nothing else to really gain from them that you wouldn t be able to find a lot faster somehwere else the only thing pvp gives you is angery noises and salty tears that s about it it pains me to see that such an awesome game is lacking literally everything that would otherwise make this one of the most rewarding pvp games out there most early access turds have more content in the long run and a more promising meta gameplay than this which effing sucks because the foundation is there and it s yuuuuuge the teamplay is awesome crew members need to perform their tasks accordingly sea battles are a truly exciting experience the water is beautiful sailing is fun but there is no depth to it not even in 2020 a good idea with shallow execution also these controls are beyond stupid one box opens with f and another one with r and both of them are closed with x like why why would you screw with my fingers like that i m a pirate not a pianist
