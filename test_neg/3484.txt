2017 the game isn t bad per se it s actually pretty damn good i must say it s fun the gameplay is varied and you never get bored but sending a cease and desist letter to modders big mistake my friend i don t support multiplayer cheating but singleplayer modding isn t harmful in any way if you don t support such publisher practice let your voice be heard
