2022 i have come to the conclusion that this game no longer respects the players time its farm frame for a reason is it free to play yes but you need to trade for plat if you want to get anywhere and that takes a long time all the new systems that come out with every update can be really cool but unfortunately that leaves this game more and more shallow it is just a game of cool ideas and nothing cohesive
