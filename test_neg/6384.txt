2023 i m a survivor main with over 800 hours so i think it s safe for me to say that this game is very addicting and very fun at times however tunneling and camping has been an issue since the game started the reason people started tunneling is because the game was for a while survivor sided between swfs and coms killers were having a very difficult time winning so they resolved to tunneling and camping this has been an issue for quite a long time and bhvr started to fix it nothing bhvr does ever fixes it because they dont listen to what their community wants to fix tunneling they gave survivors bt but it only lasts for 8 seconds and is only good for one hit and obviously if a killer wants to tunnel you then one hit isn t going to deter them after that update this just started going downhill bhvr had many killers complaining that the game was too survivor sided even though we are faced with constant nerfing over the last few months behavior has nerfed self care boon circle of healing dead hard iron will off the record and countless other survivor perks why because killers wont stop complaining the game is barely fun anymore bhvr is just a selfish company that only fixes the game just enough to be played bhvr released killers that are practically made for tunneling and camping the knight the skull merchant the dredge the artist the twins etc all of these killers since the beginning of game have the ability to tunnel but bhvr only makes it easier i ddont mind killers like the wraith because they were original dbd killers and weren t mainly used for camping but all the even relatively new killers are basically just mad for tunneling whether that be camping in lockers camping with guards camping with drones camping with a deformed younger brother camping with birds or any other form dont even get me started on killers like the clown he is op but nobody will admit it the only way to run him or escape him is to just w key but not even that works because he can just throw a bottle at you and its over bc you are significantly slower and can no longer see i have never met a clown main that wasnt toxic because they know they can get away with it this game is trash now tbh bhvr is catering to whining killers because the game is survivor sided no its not and they know it isnt they just want an easy win self care got nerfed even more because survivors were healing too fast with self care you could already only heal at 35 normal healing speed but i guess that s too hard on the killers because now it at the least takes as long as a generator without anything else in fact you can complete a generator before you finish healing boon circle of healing got nerfed because we were healing to fast again now we can only see each other s auras when we are in the boon radius dead hard got nerfed because it gave us more of a chance of surviving the chase now we have to unhook somebody to use it when the only one getting hooked will be the dead hard users because they cant use their main perk iron will got nerfed because killers couldnt find us off the record got nerfed because it was too op but do you know what bhvr hasnt nerfed killer perks the only perks that got nerfed from them are gens regression perks noed is still here what about that what about the perks and add ons that practically give the killers an easy win what about light born it literally makes a flashlight and flashbang useless why can killers even see us in a lobby even though killers cant switch between killers they can still switch perks they can still switch add ons they can see our items which means they can completely counter that with their perks and add ons they can see our ranks which means they can dodge lobbies if they dont like what we re carrying or if they don t want to face a survivor over a rank of 2 they can see our profiles they can see all of it what about us we cant do that we cant switch a perk to completely counter what the killer has we cant dodge lobbies if we dont like the killer we cant dodge lobbies if we dont like their rank this game is trash at this point bhvr is making tunneling easy and it s ruining every ounce of fun that s still left in the game but you know gotta make that money they are only catering to the killers they are treating them like they re made of glass bhvr is honestly just a selfish company that doesnt care about their community they just dont want to lose killers and that will be their downfall they are gonna lose millions of dollars because survivors aren t going to put up with it i m not sure how many more updates i ll stick around for if they keep this up then im leaving the community and im sure many more will follow
