2017 after buying this game on over 3 consoles ps3 xbox 360 and ps4 and then pc id like to say im happy with rockstar and take two but after the modding ban both companys can go pound mud up their behinds gta online is basically pay to win and not fun at all when you cant even drive around without getting murdered by some 13 year old yelling obscene things at you theres been no singleplayer dlcs nothing all they care about is rockstar and take two i hope you reverse the modding ban and let players play what they choose and mod if they so wish
