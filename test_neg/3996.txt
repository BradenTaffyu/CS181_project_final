2016 the game started off great it was promising online was fun and then came hackers and ban waves suddenly the population dropped massively and hackers became rampant you can t go anywhere without encountering hackers they are on every server and since rockstar is the most useless company ever nothing is done about these hackers and this forces people to fight fire with fire more people hack just so they can stand a chance tldr rockstar may make good games but they suck at moderating them they suck at keeping multiplayer something that is enjoyable they don t care about keeping their game good tldr of the tldr rockstar is useless
