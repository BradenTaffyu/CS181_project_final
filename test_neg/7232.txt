let me just preface this by saying that this game is fun i am about halfway thorough the main story explored a lot of the map and still looking forward to playing every day even with the extremely lacklustre enemy variety however i cannot recommend the game for it s current price just wait until you can get it at least 50 off by that time they might even optimise it and maybe add some new content although i doubt it if you don t care about the price and have a good pc buy it and you will have fun playing it simple as that
