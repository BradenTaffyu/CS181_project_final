2022 i m so conflicted on this i love this game genuinely i ve already spent nearly 200 hours on it i want it to be the most amazing soulslike experience out there because the potential is there there are so many things that the game exceeds at and what keeps pulling me back in for more playthroughs i ve beaten every boss gotten every rememberance i m currently trying to beat the game without summons and without wearing armor that s how much i love playing this game but the flaws in elden ring are too great and that s what kind of stings it really does feel like fromsoft started to get high off of their own reputation as that one company that makes the insanely hard games so much so that they made a game that s just completely there s a difference between something being hard and something being challenging dark souls 3 had so many amazing bosses that were difficult but were so challenging engaging and generally all around fun the final boss of ds3 for me is probably one of the most amazing boss fights in the entire dark souls series i absolutely cannot say the same about elden ring gank fights valiant gargoyles commander niall godskin duo that weren t made with consideration at all with respect to how they would be able to fight with you so you just end up being unfairly attacked on all sides bosses with utterly insane combos malenia morgott maliketh that force to i frame through 20 different attack and give you half a second to punish or leave you too much out of stamina to even attack the insane input reading crucible knight godskin duo draconic sentinel that causes the enemies to attack you the instant you let go of the heal button nigh undodgable aoe attacks valiant gargoyles commander niall godfrey completely ludicrous difficulty spikes everything post leyndell where even if you have 45 vigor enemies will just two shot you i m being genuine when i say fromsoft is trying too hard to appeal to their reputation for being the company that made dark souls the thing that made dark souls 3 so brilliant was that almost every boss was fast and punishing but made with perfect balance so that at all times you knew exactly how you messed up and how you can learn from next time in order to beat them i beat every boss in ds3 feeling proud of myself i beat every boss in elden ring just stewing in frustration what challenge is there in trying to juggle two unabalanced gargoyles or getting instantly killed by malenia s waterfowl dance there is none there s nothing to learn for a lot of people they don t feel like they overcame a challenge they feel like they lucked out because a boss didn t use a completely broken moveset compared to dark souls 3 or sekiro elden ring just feels so lazy why bother crafting a perfect boss experience when you can just give malenia hyperpoise every time she attacks or have the godskin duo punish you every time you try to heal as much as i hate to admit this i think a lot of the issues i have with this game stems from fromsoft trying to stretch a dark souls game into an open world game which is a shame because the open world is what i like most content recycling is rampant the same few catacombs are repeated over and over again through the land i think after leyndell there are no unique enemies that even appear it s all enemies you ve seen before i think the most egregious is that out of the 165 boss in this game only around 5 10 do not have a duplicate boss somewhere else i was so excited exploring in limgrave because all of the boss designs were so unique in interesting it was so exciting just randomly exploring and suddenly encountering a boss out in the wild that feeling quickly faded once i encountered my sixth ulcerated tree spirit or 4th tibia mariner the most insane is them reusing astel and godrick in completely unrelated areas completely robbing those bosses of any uniqueness they had genuinely the game should ve ended after leyndell or at least should ve left the mountaintops of the giants an optional area you didn t have to go through in order to beat there are so many things i love about this game and i wish it could be so much better because the potential is there but the world design in the second of half of the game becomes so much more stale and the bosses in the game are even weaker than the ones in dark souls 2 in a it s a dark souls like game so let s just make things insanely difficult for no reason kind of way i really hope that a major patch fixes some of these issues or they improve their design in the dlc because i am not at all excited in the direction fromsoft is taking themselves as a company that tries way too hard to play up to their reputation for difficult games that they forget to make it fun first i saw a comment in a youtube video a while back that said once the hype dies down people will talk about this game the same way they talk about dark souls 2 and i fear they may be right too many flaws bog down what could ve been a 10 10 game
