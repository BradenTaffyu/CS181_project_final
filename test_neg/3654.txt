2018 i have had this game for a long time now and due to recent events in gta online i have decided to finally write a review after some 250 hours of gameplay spanning several years i was as many others have been struck wrongly by the fateful hand of one of rockstars banning sweeps i recieved thankfully only a temporary suspention from gta online however what was more infuriating was that my gta online character something that i have probably spent the best part of 200 hours or more playing was to be reset completely these online bans or suspentions may not be appeald so if like myself you are wrongfully banned you do not even get the chance to fight your corner their decision is final however wrong it may be it is for this reason the fact that i will no longer be able to play my well worked gta online character that i can no longer reccomend this game purchace at your own risk
