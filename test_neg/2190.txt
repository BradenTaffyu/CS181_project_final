really really love this game always looking forward to future updates but this most recent one was a blow to the more advanced players the devs claimed to remove macro only techniques none of which were even hard to do for a human taking advanced movement techniques out of a game only punishes the people who put the most time into the game and the tools are easy enough that anyone can learn them game is still great but the review will be negative until this is changed back or balanced in some way
