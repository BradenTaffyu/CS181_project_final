2020 this game is getting more far from its origins and purpose by each season i uninstalled the game after several years of playing because this last season zero literally make the game a silly fps and i don t believe its the same tactical shooter that released in 2015 ubisoft just wants to make the game easier for people to sell more copies of it so i m gonna say goodbye to it now thanks for the great memories
