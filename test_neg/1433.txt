look at my hours clearly i am a fan of this game i am leaving a negative review because of the clear decline of creative assembly s business practices and how it manifests in this title idea is great the tw system is great warhammer is a perfect match for it unfortunatly we are witnessing the late stages of a great game developer the creative teams is split in an ineffective way and the executive team have clearly spent more hours studying for their mbas than actually reading the market and monitoring their community product they are juicing this thing until its dead the game is bugged bad with no clear plan for meaningful overhaul the dlcs are getting more expensive with less content also buggy as heck lol and the qa team would rather silence and insult the community than fix the product there are other great games out there get off this store page
