2022 this review is for gta online only not for gta 5 story mode its not worth it promisegrind a lot of itmodders a lot of themgrind that can be ruined easilytoxic community bring some bleach for your eyesglitches dont be surprised if the other half of the players that arent modders are using a glitch of some sortnpcs for missions grinds has god mode occasionally and god like aim from a high speed car or helicopters if you want to do all of that then this is the game for you but for me ill play it with friends or solo occasionally everything else i just cant handle because its annoying
