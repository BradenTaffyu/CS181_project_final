2017 gta v the game is probably one of the best games i ve ever played so why do i not recommend the game i got banned for no reason on christmas eve i lost progress worth 250 hours then i waited one month to be able to play the game again seven days after the unban i got permanently banned from the game both times i sent in support tickets and they did just send the same you have done some of these things and that s why you got banned they can t even tell me why i got banned if you buy the game for the single player campaign this does not apply to you you can t banned from the single player that easily if you buy the game for gta online you should consider not to buy this game
