2023 this game is super fun and feels like a fresh breeze of air in a sea of br s with a few exceptions because this game is buy to play it really stops most of the players to try it out including me i kept my eye on this game for a long time until i saw it on a good discount eu na player base is not that big especially compared to china i heard something about 15mil sold copies what do we get from all this we get ridiculously unfair ranked matchmaking how it s fair to place fresh players against literally top 500 sweatlords and chinese smurfs with 200 ping i m pretty sure some people drop this game only because of this and you can t blame them plus add complexity of the game 14 characters with different skills and their variations and a bunch of melee and ranged weapons which in my opinion is a good thing but still it take some time to learn it all despite all the downsides this game is worth a try but be prepared for the challenges i hope the developers will someday realize the need to move to an f2p model and this game will shine
