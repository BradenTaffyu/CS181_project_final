2018 at first gta was a fantastic game with some slight issues now its complete and utter scrap after 3 years they are still selling the game at full retail price the loading times in game are extremely long whice they havnt fixed yet joining lobbies and playing heists are very difficoult if you join a lobby and someone leaves then the whole lobby disconects and you have to find new players and a new lobby to play with and then you already have spent 5 10 minutes just cause of the loading times in game you can barely have any source of reliable income and the items you purschase are so expensive that you have to grind for a redicolous amount of hours to afford and they microtransaction so called shark cards costs pretty much more than the entire game if you want to afford anything in game rockstar needs to get their act together instead of being greedy and trying to push people into spending more money on shark cards even though this post will ever bother them
