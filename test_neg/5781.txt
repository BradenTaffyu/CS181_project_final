2018 the game can be fun but not in its currrent state i picked this game up back in operation skull rain early october 2016 a friend recommended the game to me so i gave it a try and after a few rounds i was addicted to the game mostly the pvp game modes since the pve becomes quickly tiresome in my opinion i played a lot in parties of two till four players and sometimes solo i recommend to bring a friend or two along since its way more fun this way because this game surely requires some teamplay it really depends on how the enemy team is performing any player with some fps experience will quickly pick up how to play this game and probably end up in the higher end of the scoretable teamplay is recommended but not necessary to win the game pick a fast operator with a decent gun or one of the recently released operators since they are either unbalanced for example ela when she was added to the game or break up the till then existing meta which forces players to change their gameplay and exposes them more to mistakes in their gameplay and sometimes even both map awareness is key learn the maps seriously invest some time in memorizing at least some key points on the map every map has its own points where it is very easy for the attacker or defender team to get a few quick kills you can move as careful as you want you will probably die a lot by player made murderholes in walls or barricades or rappeling attackers who lurk around at some broken window learn and adapt to the most popular spots and try to guess where its most likely that some enemy could wait for you the same goes for all sorts of traps after some time you will see a pattern in how players usually place traps and might even be able to get some clues by how gadgets are placed and usually indicate that a trap is nearby e g a ballistic shield in a doorframe that would require to vault over it frost trap kapkan tarp and or lesion trap behind it the sound and graphics the game looks very good textures are sharp the lightning since they overhauled it back in operation health go check out the comparrisons of old and new lightning and the sounds are the best i heard so far at least when it comes to environmental sounds like footsteps and and distant gunshots the sound is very important in this game since its focused on close quarters combat which means that you only got little time to react the sound of footspets people crawling over the floor or just them shifting in leaning or reloading the gun can help you as a player to find out where your opponent is and get him before he is able to get you so for your own pleasure and fun and the one of your teammembers wear headphones and turn off any music porn videos or any other sources of sounds like children gf bf just turn them off but please in a legal way that might play in the background oh and use a mic for that short team interactions you might have teamplayshooter or not teamplayshooter rainbow six siege features operators that a player can pick from every time a new round starts those operators are divided into an attacker and defender pool which means that as a defender you cant pick an attacker operator every single operator has a gadget that gives him her an unique ability players are encouraged to use those abilities since the usually help out the team in a whole like traps barricades extra cams now here is where i would argue why this game isn t really a teamplayshooter and for that i must mention the community of the game there is the argument often made that you shouldn t review the community of a game because its not the games fault in my opinion this argument is pure bs but i will go into detail with that later most of the time the team interaction is limited to those gadget placements phases after that its often everybody for himself sure people might pick each other up if they are downed but where is the moving and clearing room after room with a buddy covering each others back discussing how to move into the building who goes for the hostage who stays behind to catch eventual roamers who brings the breaching charge who the emp shotgun or smg do we have a marksman or does everybody just goes with a shield dont get me wrong i dont expact this to happen in a casual game my only point is that this game has much more potential in this aspect than there currently is used by the community and it doesnt seem to be the focus of the community either just watch a pro league match even those players are often alone and all over the map seperated from each other players might be in a team but at the end everybody moves out to hunt on their own the community now with 80 less bad words now we are coming to my favorite part the community and yes i will review that and why recent changes from ubisoft side encouraged me to put down the game the community was never good to begin with but i didn t expect anything special everybody who ever played counter strike in his life probably knows what an unpleasant place the internet or more like the didicated server can be however in a competitive nature that these kinds of games bring along with them it totally normal to experience emotional outbursts eventually those subjects either quit calm down or even might pull themselves back to the top of the score board no harm done no hard feelings bad words where said mothers experienced sexual intercourse and racial assumptions were made now a small but vocal minority took a hard look at that behaviour and decided that this cant be allowed to happen and so we got the new glorious chat filter to make players behave eliminate the toxicity and cure cancer itself welp it just didnt work it would have been much easier to just give the player the ability to mute voice and text chat which was implemented along with the chat filter the textfilter doesnt censor the bad word it bans the author from playing the game online the time increases with every repeated incident the textfilter is supposed to stop racial homophobic slurs and so on in my opinion it just killed the chat since it was filled with quite entertaining now it usually is just quiet because people are afraid to say something people developed a sport where they try to trick others into saying words on a ban list those people end up banned quite confused since they didnt even know that they were writing something offensive happend to myself as well with the word it hits non native english speakers quite often since those people usually lack the socialisation process that provides you with the hidden meaning of that to you harmless word and thats were i draw the line for myself i wont have a product that was created for adults parent me and what i write in chat its their product they can do whatever they want with it but in my opinion it just hurts the game i dont care about people saying offensive stuff on the internet since they are just that people who never met me who i dont care about and neither care they about me or should do so we play a game we have fun some talk others dont the game ends and we move on with our lifes something offends you mute him mute the text chat but please dont begins to censor people since they will always find new ways to live out their toxic ways its not the games fault how the community behaves but certain games attract certain people and you cant have the game without the community or vise versa and since the community just got worse with the recent changes which isnt the commnuitys fault but more ubisofts i will stop playing this game it was fun while it lasted but here is my stop
