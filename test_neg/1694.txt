2023 warhammer 2 was far better i don t think there is a comparison it seems like everything about the game was designed by some executive or director that had no idea what actually made warhammer 2 fun just look at some of the terrible ui decisions at launch like making the build and deconstruct icon both red like what not only did they seem to want to make change just for the sake of change the changes they made made the game more of a drag seiges while a promising premise are now a naggy annoying arcade style mini game that is even less fun to play than warhammer 2 a lot of the other changes too were seem be made to spite players rather than keeping elements that made the game fun as a single player game its like they viewed it as a challenge to themselves to make everything less fun and more annoying i could ramble on and on about every little detail but straight up its just not as fun as 2 2 built on the 1st game and became one of my favorite games ever 3 has taken two steps backwards and four steps sideways but hey there s 4 half baked chaos factions where half the units are reskins which totally warranted a new game tag
