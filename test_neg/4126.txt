2020 do not buy this game unless you love loading screensboth the singleplayer and online have loading screens that lasts almost 3 hours before you could join a match or worse it finally gives you an error message and keep in mind rockstar hasnt even updated the game s performance at least from what i ve searched up they keep adding dlcs that doesnt even contribute in the game s ability to even be played and the only bugs they would fix is bugs that allow players to earn money faster in gtao not to mention gtao is just filled with cheaters griefers and contains the most repetitive and annoying grind just to get a crumb of proper content and if you got the game and is interested in the heists good luck playing anything cause the only fun you will get is from this rm300 overglorified loading screen simulator that disconnects freezes you after youre loaded in or if youre lucky you will be frozen in place for the next 5 minutes after you and your squad has readied up adding to this rockstar keeps adding in pointless additions of vehicles or weapons that contributes to griefers which will usually you up the moment you step out of your apartment mainly and especially the loser s pride that is the orbital cannon and the oppressor mk2 did i mention gtao is ridiculously p2w when it comes to weapons and vehicles or even business property upgrades unless you spent your life on this game as if it s a second job or pay almost 3000 for shark cards singleplayer on the other hand although i ve spoilt myself with the story before i even bought this game its just the same as gtao but the only plus i can see this is the fact that you can mod cheat however you like without harming other people s fun but thats all gunplay is fun at first but after awhile it might get repetitive and the scripted events doesnt seem fun after a few hours in however if you people would still want to buy this game i highly suggest getting it on a high discount this game is not worth the high price for these existing problems and i really hope youre patient enough to wait through minutes and even hours of just loading though i do agree the races are fun there are better racing games than gta5
