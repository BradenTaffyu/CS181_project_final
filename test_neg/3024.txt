2017 rockstar should not present a game to you that is so aggressively in favor of either grinding or microtransactions while doing absolutely nothing at all to stop the people who can freely mod the game to allow them to destroy the only method of getting the high level multiplayer items without paying for them that s the second time in a row that i ve tried to sell vehicle cargo to get money to even dip into gunrunning that i ve been stopped by a player i could ve easily taken down except for the fact that they were invinicible rockstar is attempting to sell you a multiplayer experience that forces you to spend money on mictrotransactions not only with the only items that are worth anything being near prohibited by tremendous amounts of grinding time but by a hacking player base that will destroy every attempt at that grinding that they are seemingly willfully ignoring if you want this for the singleplayer buy it though with the way rockstar and yes take two is more involved but once again rockstar doesn t care to defend its playerbase from threats to their enjoyment handles the modding scene i don t know if that s a particularly good idea either so i ll amend that statement too don t buy this show rockstar they need to actually pay attention to the playerbase they so enjoy ignoring by ignoring them the same way they do
