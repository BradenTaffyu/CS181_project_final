2022 i really enjoyed the game when i first started playing a year ago but if you don t enjoy pvp or suck at it this is a terrible game the game itself is gorgeous and the content was enjoyable to play but it has become impossible to enjoy due to constantly having my ship attacked sunk by other players it used to be only the reapers you had to watch out for but now it is all players i have come to have zero respect for the creators as they constantly ignore those of us who want an option that doesn t include pvp they say it s because it would take away from the real pirate experience they are full of they have definitely lost me as well as friends who play because of the toxicity from pvp and the creators refusal to make it an enjoyable experience for all players highly disappointed
