2018 fun game but blatant cash grab and the new autoban system is horrendously broken ubisoft have taken a political stance by censoring chat through autobanned words in a failed effort to curttail toxicity i am seeing tons of players banned for answering questions like spell dabbing backwards gnibbad apparently is banned makes 0 sense what is cartman s comic book hero name from south park again the short for racoon latin american players are getting banned for the word negro which stands for black in their native language system is broken as hell game is currently not worth playing in this state don t have a text based system if you re hell bent on policing it through a broken autoban filter that you have no intention reverting your stance on i fell for the dabbing bit and received a 30 minute autoban here was the response from the support team as for the ban we are unable to overturn temporary bans you have been banned for toxicity for typing the derivative of a racial slur in the chat please do not let trolls bait you in chat if it seems like a completely innocent question it probably isn t any racial slur as well as any derivative thereof regardless of context or language violates policy please review the code of conduct to prevent further sanctions thanks
