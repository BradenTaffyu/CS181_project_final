2020 i want to preface this with a note of how sad it makes me to write this i ve played this game with friends since it came out for xbox 360 and have had some really amazing memories while playing i even bought copies of this game for over 8 of my friends when it came out on pc because of how excited i was to play it on a quality system instead of a console with that said however i would never recommend buying a rockstar game of any kind both gta online and red dead redemption online have become utter and total garbage we are also committed to ensuring that our games are fun for everyone and as safe as possible from modders cheaters hackers and those who seek to harass other players the above statement from rockstar is a joke at best rockstar legitimately doesn t care at all about user experience or about being accountable to their promises or offers they allow players to mod and hack their game online and do nothing at all to enforce any kind of rules regarding this however they will punish players who haven t modded but have gotten cash from modders whether the player wanted that money or not they constantly add new game features that are either broken and don t work at all or just ruin the enjoyment available to game play oppressor mk2 rockstar will also punish players for using so called in game exploits that their poor programming and total lack of testing foresight created yet they refuse to do anything at all to rectify the untenable situation that modders have created in their games its honestly just pathetic and indicates that their programmers and project managers are either lazy amateurs or just plain dumb they will also constantly advertise bonus cash payouts for their shark cards that they literally never pay out check the rockstar support forums regarding this and you can find countless entries regarding players not being paid out the bonus cash for more than 6 years now you are better off buying a copy of fallout 76 or any ea game even at least that garbage is better supported and maintained than any rockstar game and speaking frankly i doubt that rockstar will ever change how they respond to player requests and their game being ruined by the select few who choose to cheat rip rd online and gta online you were both beautiful ideas that your creators simply saw for cash cows i pity any of the developers who were passionate about this because their passions have been treated with 0 respect and 0 care tl drgta online and rd online are so plagued with hacking modding and glitchy missions events they aren t playable rockstar gives 0 they will lie to you about offers and punish you for complaining or commenting you are wasting your money if you buy 0 10
