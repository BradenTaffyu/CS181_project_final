big fan of the first game and despite my short playtime so far i am sure i will love the sequel that being said there are issues i personally think the reaction to the mtxs are a bit overblown they are more like almost useless micro dlc offering items that can otherwise almost all be acquired through playing unfortunate that they were added in the first place but easily ignored the more pressing issue is the abysmal performance even with low settings and dlss on the first small village drops me down to 40 ish fps on a 5800x and 3080 the cpu bottle necking is insane and should be fixed asap hopefully some tweaks can get this game the reviews i believe it deserves but right now don t purchase
