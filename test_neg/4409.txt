2016 edit this review is a bit outdated but the situation is pretty much the same if not worse game might seem fun in the beginning but i would not recommend trying it as it quickly turns into horrible grind where you have to pay if you don t want to play hundreds of hours of the same missions to see if you are lucky and if you are go grind for resources now which also in many cases takes quite a bit of time and after that wait several days until the item is built but then at some point you are either burnt or unlucky and you just pay as you get what you are looking for instantly and already built with each update devs look for new ways to make you do that while saying yeah we want to decrease the grind sure original review here i guess it was fun while it lasted it s hard for me to write this after so long to begin with the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed we started playing warframe with my friends when it was not on steam yet like almost 4 years ago none of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time developers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band aid fix is released which doesn t adress the issue itself broken enemy armor and health scaling useless weapons and warframes aka mastery fodder energy management is non existant most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or op due to superb cc capability or straight invulnerability etc and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on every once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two two three weeks after it s been released and almost nobody uses it and there s a plenty of such cases archwing dark sectors conclave kubrows syndicates maroo s bazaar focus seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced lunaro grind oh god grind increases exponentially with each new update i feel really bad for newer players devs tell they want to change the situation where old time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on and how they fix it they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called cryotic to explain you can get like 100 cryotic in 2 3 minutes maximum if you re good at only type of missions where you can get it excavation there you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one shot by high level enemy there s enemy damage scaling issues too yup not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one after community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue devs release new primed warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource oxium of 14000 by similar i mean the way to obtain it you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best and there are not too many of those enemies after another community uproar it was changed to 7000 which is still a huge amount for many people and more so for newer players also void a place where primed glorified versions of warframes and weapons drop there were already many prime warframes released and some of them have already been vaulted taken out of drop tables the official reason for that is there isn t too much space in void mission for many primed warframes and weapons and not to create dilution in drop tables some primes were vaulted but from dev team s actions you can guess the real reason is different there are several mission types in the void that have little to no prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago thus intentionally diluting void mission rewards also devs tend to put most desirable primed parts into most boring and long 20 min missions in the void and the chance for this part is like 5 or so and guess what it s 5 for one of 5 different parts making it 1 if you re lucky for the exact part you want i guess it s okay that people don t want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need not to go too much into details i d say void missions are not the only missions that have this problem recently there was an update addressing most of op warframe abilities and that seems to be causing another community uproar now as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those op abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics i m not sure how high level missions sorties or raids aka trials will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more especially when you barely scratch the enemy s health lvl 100 enemies endgame here is like it s either you relying on those op abilities to keep you alive or you get one two shot the moment you fail to do so tl dr devs produce more and more content and bugs and broken mechanics too and seems like they forget of even 2 3 month old content ever incresing grind with latest updates exponentially warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these op abilities many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed
