2021 hahahaha imagine they release a broken update which 80 of the community hates release half assed animations break the game s mechanics by giving the killer telepathic powers and then to cover their asses they buy a bunch of bots to give positive reviews on the release day of the update just to counteract the hate they ve received from releasing said broken updateyou can t even properly dodge the killer anymore you can vault through the window walk 3 steps and he ll still hit you from the other side because of his telepathic weapon honestly in this state just save yourself the hassle and skip this don t put trash like this in your shopping cart this comes from someone who used to love this game before this update update game is a bit more enjoyable now but the devs decided to release a new chapter then proceeded to lock us out of playing pub matches on the new map for like 2 3 weeks now due to cosmetic glitches they decided to enforce some word censorship system in the post game chat without an option to turn it off so that spanish people can t even type dead hard in their language because some wanker decided to censor dumb words like facecamp or sit new killer feels inconsistent as where his power can sometimes hit you through a tall wall but miss you when he s aiming right for you why do they force themselves to release new killers every 3 months take a break take longer inbetween chapters to actually fix the game and work on your killers so you dont release buggy messes like twins who i love playing as but i ve seen them glitch out like absolute and it s been 7 months after their release or this inconsistent nemesis wankeri would still advise you to skip this game even on sale it might be fun when you re playing it with your friends but that fun runs out once you reach green ranks once there it slowly starts turning into a sweat fest if you somehow manage to end up in purple red ranks then i seriously wish you luck bring a group of similar skilled friends at least because the game will suck more and more with each match update2 the game was in a somewhat and by somewhat i mean very playable state and somehow they it up even more with the cenobite the game outright dc s you and or crashes to desktop when you face the new killer many killers have their core mechanics bugged and broken i e nightmare getting stunned by a fake pallet that is not meant to do that people reporting that their frames even on lowest setting dipped by a lot the pallet texture being replaced by an ugly thing that belongs in the first half life era not to mention the fact they changed the rank system to some grades and decided to give out rewards for em except the rewards are so absolutely it s not even worth to grind for em still as i ve said before skip on this unless you re very high on ketamine morphine metamphetamine cocaine or any other illegal drug
