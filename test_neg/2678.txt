2018 tldr the game is fun but rockstar and take two provide no specific information regarding suspension or bans even if bans are final this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue to make it clear my current temporary suspension is a false positive to my knowledge i requested further information regarding the eula violation from their support team they chose not to provide infomration on the eula violation nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the eula i can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible until this week i would have recommended gta v as a great game it has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities missions events with more than four players which is a common pitfall of most co operative games this has given the game replay value which led to the large number of hours i have played it whenever my friends and i needed a game we all were happy to play gta v was commonly the choice i will acknowledge that gta v itself is a great game to play with friends and alone however on monday whilst mid mission gta v s anti cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension like a broken record i will say that i do not cheat exploit or mod the game nor do i have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory at the time i summised that gta v s cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code control window handles or view memory i am relatively sure that it was my as rock tuning utility which was monitoring sensory data that is the culprit i deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that i had not run while running gta v over a long period of time however i can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the gta v executable nor its online service i do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension which i am quite happy to do understand that an anti cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally and then find that i am permanently banned the problem with this game isn t the anti cheat engine itself in software engineering of this nature there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats so many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti cheat engine more aggressive result more false positives the problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff i sent a message to support not asking to appeal the ban explicitly telling them that i did not wish to appeal but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that i could determine what caused the issue the support message was viewed three times according to their latest activity timer over two days and then charles provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue this is the problem rockstar and take two s line is that everyone is banned for a reason and therefore bans are final if they enforce this then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn t tell me what set it off your anti cheat engine more so it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information furthermore there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense in particular in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor i e they stop online support for the game by permanently banning someone i e terminating online services to that registered account this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct if they don t provide proof of the infraction then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services the burden of proof is on take two or rockstar to prove that you violated the eula if they can t provide the evidence then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own eula since the eula is essentially a contract they are legally liable in this scenario if the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the eula then i would recommend this game because then the game service or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false as it is rockstar take two nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information furthermore the support channels they provide for eula violations i e bans provides no further assistance in the issue why have it at all just tell us that you don t answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time so as it stands i will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information hence i do not recommend this game because at this time i can not fully utilise the product without risk of the licensor take two violating the conditions of their eula in the termination section i e permanently banning me and with no possiblity of the licensee me seeking appeal or remedy
