2023 as an avid player and longtime fan of gta this hurts the game undoubtedly offers an immersive open world experience i can t help but feel dismayed by the sheer number of vehicles that have been locked behind paywalls this decision seems to prioritize monetization over the enjoyment of the players leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of players like myself a staggering number of cars motorcycles planes and other vehicles were made only accessible through a paid subscription it felt like a slap in the face to realize that the game s true potential was held hostage behind a paywall forcing players to open their wallets wide those who are unwilling or unable to spend extra money on in game purchases find themselves at a disadvantage unable to access the same level of content as their paying counterparts this creates an unfair imbalance and fosters a sense of exclusion among players ultimately damaging the overall gaming experience
