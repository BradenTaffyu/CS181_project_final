2023 this is the anti game it s the opposite of unwinding after a long day you play this game to either get riled up or rile someone else up for the most petty nonsense for some reason it takes people thousands of hours into this game to realize how mentally draining and obnoxious it is let alone mechanically clunky unreliable and buggy wishlisting this game is like asking santa for coal thrown directly at your nutsack by a professional baseball pitcher 9 out of 10 people acting like a manchild in other games will have very high playtime in dbd i m betting 500 turkmenistan yen on that guarantee get this game if you re a masochist though after all those updates and patches the community must really be into it to still stick around ace visconti goes hard though unfortunately he s not enough to save the game
