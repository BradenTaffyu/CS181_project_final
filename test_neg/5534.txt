2023 i love getting a multi hour ban because ubisoft releases broken updates that cause people to randomly crash during a match over and over edit 24 hour ban because of ubisoft s incompetent programmers and developers edit 2 matchmaking is so absolutely borked that no one can find a match and your friends get pulled into a lobby but you re still matchmaking thus getting you banned if it s not one thing it s another with this absolute gem of a season great job ubisoft
