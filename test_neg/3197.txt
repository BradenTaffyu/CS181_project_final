2020 fix your servers fix loading fix ease of use i have to click 50 times just so i can start a stupid race with my friend hoping that the game won t disconnect me and send me back to single player hoping that i will actually be in the lobby with my friend and hoping it won t load another 10 minutes i can t believe you re re releasing the game for ps5 this is the 3rd time you re releasing the same game trying to milk more money off it it s outdated and getting boring give us gta 6 with normal servers and do not follow the steps of gta online also don t give free games you just brought a horde of fortnite kids flooding servers with cheaters too many cheaters literally non existent anti cheat system and i don t even want to talk about the kick player function in every normal game the vote is initiated reason of kick is stated the players vote yes or no and the player is then kicked or not kicked where do you invest your money rockstar pathetic i tried i invested a decent amount of time in the game but nothing is fixed since i got the game a while ago singleplayer is great though
