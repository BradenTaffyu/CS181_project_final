i absolutely love this game played the heck out of it when it was released for xbox gamepass but has since been removed from it my gripe is that i had purchased dlc packs through the xbox store and they did not carry over so i had to purchase them again to play them through steam also this game cost 79 99 cad but you only get 1 4 of the content the other 3 4 is locked behind purchasing warhammer i ii but guess what those still each cost 70 cad just to be able to have access to the full game for that this game gets a thumbs down i really wish there was a meh option
