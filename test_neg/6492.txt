2017 edit the review was rushed so i have updated it to the best of my ability edit 1 please ignore the 27 hours as i barely played the pc version edit 2 thoroughly explained as best as i could as to what s wrong as a fan of this game i ve decided to come forth and finally give my two cents be forewarned that i will be honest and i will not sugarcoat anything tl dr toxic survivors have taken over the game and constantly demand that everything be balanced in their favor leading to decent survivors killers to become toxic to counter the issues full review had you asked me if this game was worth checking out back in the day when both sides got along i would have said yes buy it if you can and try it out if you were to ask me today i would simply tell you no it s not worth the money nor time or effort the game has become a lopsided nightmare due to survive with friends which is now used primarily for just joining matches and leading troll runs toward killer mains players which has lead to toxcicity from the killer side in turn due to the survivors intentionally with malicious intent if i may be so bold to add thwarting all of the killers actions while the others go behind their back i e pallet environment window looping luring the killer away while the others heal their comrade fix gens or the downed player uses unbreakable or rush the hook when the gates are opened in one of my experiences and use borrowed time run in front of their wounded allies and take the hit etc killer mains are treated as if they are war criminals by the now toxic survivor community and killers are now paying a price they didn t ask for nor deserve because toxic survivors throw claims that they re overpowered survivors now have a higher advantage over the killer than what they had before and are now leading coordinated trolls on killers via software such as discord or so on pc and parties via the console ports as well abuse their perks and items they have acquired which has lead killer mains players high rank or not to camp and tunnel nearly every match toxic survivors also abuse the report options should the game not go their way or disconnect the instant they come across a killer they dislike while the dc ing isn t really a major issue the abuse of the report system is clearly a disgrace within itself to speak out about the issues mentioned above like i m doing results in becoming a martyr as the toxic survivor side instantly becomes unhinged the toxic survivor part of the community runs rampant through the game like the black death and has pretty much poisoned a once good game where people could have fun and make friends if you have good friends whom you love dearly then this game is fun to play outside of that the game really has no other future aside from going down in history as another casualty of good games that were taken over by toxic individuals do i love this game yes do i hate what it s become beyond a shadow of a doubt
