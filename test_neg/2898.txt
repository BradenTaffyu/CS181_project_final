2018 my character has been reset and banned due to unknown reasons rockstar goes hardcore on you if youre accused for cheating or something like that your character will be reset and your ban will last for a month and thats pretty annoying when you have spent real money on your character and also having spent 80 hours in the game not to mention buying the game itself it is absurd how my account got banned from doing absolutely nothing and is being reset and i don t even know why you cant even appeal for your account because all bans are final so yeah thats pretty darn other then this tho the game is pretty fun haha except you gotta run the risk of losing all your hard earned progress by getting falsly banned and a character reset i m angry at the game rn though so im just gonna give it a bad rating because this is and this major proiblem should not be happening on such a popular game
