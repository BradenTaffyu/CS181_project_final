it was fun and i enjoyed it its impossible not to but as someone who waited ages for a dd1 sequel that was finally given the time and budget to feel complete this game wasn t it i can sum up my disappointment with the fact that you spend the entire game fighting the same 4 5 enemy types that you spent the whole game fighting in dd1 goblins saurians harpies wolves and humans make up 99 of all normal encounters dd2 has almost all of the problems that 1 had and more all while feeling even more incomplete due to a lack of quests and basically no main story it has a beginning and an end with no middle bigger world better open world mechanics not nearly enough content to go in it this was not the showing that we should expect from a company like capcom in this day and age i will never understand how companies keep making games based around combat and then include so few enemies all this time and almost nothing new aside from a few bosses i ve seen so many people defend the lack of enemies as if adding an enemy or a unique moveset is the most impossible task in the world this is not an indie game this isn t even a new series when you re in a climactic fight with a rival you ve been building up you don t just make them the same human enemy you ve fought 800 times you can t just model swap the same saurian 4 times and call it content i hate that so many players give these things a pass i enjoyed the game but i just can t recommend it given the context especially at this price
