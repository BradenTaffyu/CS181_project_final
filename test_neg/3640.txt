2018 it happened i ve heard stories of people getting banned from gta online for seemingly no reason but i never ever thought i d ever be subject to this treatment been playing since i got the big collectors edition for the ps3 before heists were even released eventually i transferred my character over to the pc once i had managed to build one for years i ve been playing this game on and off and never even once have i accepted help from any hackers or modders never even once have i used any hacks or mods whether it s in singleplayer or multiplayer but today i got my account suspended and while i ll be able to play again in a month it won t be worth it as my characters progress inventory and property will all have been reset for absolutely no reason i have submitted a ticket to rockstar support surrounding this issue but i doubt it ll show any form of results if their support would manage to sort this out i ll edit this review hell i d recommend this game with a word of warning beware the incompetence of the ones in charge here tl dr don t buy this game if you plan on playing online not even legitimate play goes unpunished edit despite having been unbanned as rockstar indeed did realise they had made a mistake i ll leave this as a negative review due to the absolutely toxic playerbase which you can see below in my comment section
