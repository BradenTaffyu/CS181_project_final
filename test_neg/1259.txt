2022 i had enormous expectations having put a thousand hours into dark souls 3 alone sadly er is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through and a refusal to question the ideals of a framework first established with demon s souls in 2009 and i ended it wishing i hadn t played it at all more on this later or that steam would finally add a neutral rating for context excluding a discarded run and multiplayer my completionist and almost entirely guide free solo run lasted around 150 hours beating every boss barring malenia without summons let s open positively elden ring inherits ds3 s dna particularly combat the same crunchy brawls responsive controls and top tier animations that characterised ds3 aided by expanded enemy weapon and ability variety with magic being more diverse than ever from s signature storytelling returns requiring piecing together environmental details item descriptions and other vague information to decipher the full picture avoiding interminable cutscenes or overbearing hud notifications the lands between is geographically impressive it fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation aided by a time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changes so why the thumbs down ds3 is great because it s meaningful it s an incredible fantasy brawler but shines with its premise of a cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by gwyn and his tragic legacy s followers the ringed city dlc literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in a manifestation of cosmic decay from a realm prohibited from moving on its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected a pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanity s obsession with the past impeding a new better world being built using from s own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress it had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation not to fix its cursed world but to euthanise it and start anew instead while retaining the series unrelenting melancholy and heart of gold er ignores that it retroactively invalidates ds3 s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content and when it does deviate it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for from this is why i wish i hadn t played it ds3 made me laugh cry and stuck in my mind for years and was ultimately about something bigger than itself and powerfully resonated for it er contradicts ds3 s critique of wheel spinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way disney s maligned star wars trilogy has left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if no new films had been made at all the story is shockingly conservative with almost identical plot points settings characters and themes to from s back catalogue we again have well intended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it religious fundamentalists spurned vengeful offspring agents of chaos and a tarnished now literally player enforcing a new world order the biggest change is a bloated chain of divine command expanding ds demigods with empyrians fingers the elden beast aliens and cosmic gods but it brings few new ideas this is the reanimated corpse of a concluded story that meta commented on such narrative necromancy and is immensely disappointing for it worse what little new exists is often explicit and definitive trading the intriguing mystery of ds s nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories a decade later for a story nearly entirely resolvable in a single playthrough there is a tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment it s unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion conflict between irredeemable villains is a far cry from the turbulent power of ds s greek tragedy particularly in a setting largely morally binary and with a less charismatic cast standouts like rya or blaidd don t impact like solaire s devastating misfortune or siegward s surprising nobility characters were the emotional core of ds but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worlds gameplay is also a missed opportunity ds3 s combat is great but sekiro s is easily the best ever in a game of its type yet we re back to ds3 s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities inconsistent magic and same old movesets lacking sekiro s thrilling posture and counters mechanics dual wielding ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise and the camera is as bad as ever content suffers from repetition too dungeons keep cropping with the same music bosses and presentation occupying a huge chunk of a completionist s playthrough and the non dungeon biomes feel interminable as you re incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment lore and quests quests are as obtuse as everyone s saying borderline impossible to complete without guides a from staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further er s first areas are exciting but fifty hours in become tedious particularly with the second half s environments primarily being single level plains with occasional repeated giant assets the initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity and leads to a game that s harder to balance and populate with unique content particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of ds3 s soul of cinder and slave knight gael bosses are just bad across the board most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges homogenising combat into a wait wait wait wait single attack wait loop 150 bosses is too many for from to make each interesting fair memorable or downright enjoyable er s multiplayer is also from s worst since ds1 hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible and with covenants gone so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplay finally er s presentation is mixed its style is outstanding characters are strikingly creative and full of personality environments are dense with detail and sound effects are as satisfying as ever though the music rarely reaches ds3 s heights and is often repeated but from s ambition far outpaced their technical capacity er is graphically antiquated but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years paired with disappointing framerates considerable crashing and cheating aplenty the stutter single handedly ruined the first third of my playthrough dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving and is bad enough to alone make this review a thumbs down er wavers between being a retread of old ideas and a failed attempt at new ones it s such a missed opportunity if all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat it s great the ds template alone earns er inherited praise but if you re after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story pick up ds instead
