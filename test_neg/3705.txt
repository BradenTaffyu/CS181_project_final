2017 bought this game a couple of years ago and used to love playing it both the single and multiplayer i had a break about a year ago from the game and recently started playing again not sure what s happened to the multiplayer but it s currently unplayable due to the high amount of hackers or modders as they call themselves first multiplayer game i am driving along peacefully in my car and all of a sudden i end up in the ocean at first i think the game has gone screwy but oh no it s some who thinks it s funny to teleport me in to the sea the does this three times while being an obnoxious in chat i end up going to another server second multiplayer game i am in the middle of a shootout with some scrub who thought it would be funny to blow up my car i have killed him three times the honourable thing would be for him to admit defeat and leave me the hell alone however he then proceeds to spawn train after train on me until i am a pancake then gloats about his gaming prowess i leave the server third multiplayer game by this point i am losing faith in the multiplayer i decide to drive around a bit and am chatting to another player next moment everyone on the server dies and respawns right next to each other a mass shoot out begins this happens four times in a row i exit the game hopefully these issues will be sorted and the banned maybe then i will return to the game and change my review such a shame because i loved the multiplayer at one time singleplayer is still worth playing though
