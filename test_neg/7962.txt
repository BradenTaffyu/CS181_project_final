2021 do you want a game where you play for 6 hours killing bosses and doing quests for loot that when you want to turn in for gold you get ambushed and chased around by other players then lose everything in the heartbeat and get nothing in return for your time spent i must congratulate you this is the game you were looking for to explain the basics of the game this game is a sandbox game which means from the start of the game you have all of the items other players have weapons tools etc so the only thing you get in return for story quests and adventuring is gear to make you more good looking much like fortnite you are in an open world with 5 other players randomly spawned on outposts where you gather your starting supplies food cannonballs wooden planks you can choose to do story quests which take a whole eternity to do work for the ingame factions to gain reputation and unlock costumes and cosmetics for your ship or do events also called the wwii events where players can just come and sink your ship while you re doing it or wait for you in reaper s hideout and camp there waiting for you and then ambush you so you lose everything you farmed the whole day very amusing i know final thoughts if you are some hardcore veteran at pvp or even played fortnite this game is totally for you because its about reactions and good strategy on how to fight players for me this game is a tragedy costing me 30 i played it with my friends some moments where legendary but after everything i played through and after losing a full ship packed with treasure from a fort i m done with this game i m going back to league of legends or some mmorpgif you read through the review i m glad you took your time and read this and i hope it was helpful
