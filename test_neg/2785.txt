2018 this game is the aids of micro transactions they wonder why everyone mods why would anyone pay 100 for 8 million gta dollars that can buy you only like 2 3 vehicles when you could pay for a mod menu that costs 15 20 and do whatever the hell you want lets say you drop 5 to get the 200 000 gta dollars or even 10 on half a mil what in the hell are you going to buy with that literally nothing is at that low of a price point in this game this game s economy is so up that rockstar unintentionally created a whole 3rd party market outside of their s for people to sell modded accounts if you join a lobby literally 3 4ths of the players are modding modded this wouldn t have happened if rockstar wasn t so stingy
