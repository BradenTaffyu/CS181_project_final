2020 nice game my issue lies primarily in the community which with every single ship me and my friends have encountered around 3 so far just start trying to sink us even though we made it clear were friendly and were docked 2 of those times as a new player the last thing i want to do is go against a sweaty team of bloodthirsty players edit i played a good bit more and i m done this games community is so awful its mind blowing there have been 0 friendly ships period and i went to do fort of the damned the largest pve event in the game and people came in a destroyed our boat and took everything without a word we got a second key but they hid and camped out at the reapers hideout and killed us again my experience has been nothing but pain playing this i can say its like rust in all the worst ways i really cannot illustrate how upset i am right now with the state of this games community and i don t think ill ever be coming back to this game without someone to hard carry edit 2 i have no idea why i came back to this game whatever the reason i regret it never will i make the mistake again
