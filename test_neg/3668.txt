2018 this game is so much fun on the single player mode however on the online mode you d think you will enjoy gaming with the comunity and making friends etc but that s not the case this is a negative review so here are the negative things i really hate about gta online 1 you cant add players from the session through steam like you could do on say tf2 or counter strike you have to add them on social club and text them through there and hope they actually see it its bull crap 2 rockstar made gta online for hackers and cheaters to be born the game is not for the average player i have been playing gta online for about 2 weeks now and i was offered free money like ten times already and i declined cuz i enjoyed making my way to the top but now that i realized that i m just grinding money doing brainless joyless work over and over and over for little money i actually concidered accepting the hacked money late at night when i was on the helicopter flying for the 10th time to get supplies for my bunker i didnt get any hacked money btw yet and this is just my second week playing the game i totally get why people cheat and use hacks its makes 100 sense i d be surprised if people didnt 3 you will spend most of your time on loading screens than playing the game online you will crash alot due to connection loss or screen freezes which is something you wont experience on any other game screen freezes for a couple seconds and you re out of the session or heist or whatever so if you have blood pressure problems stay away from gta online 4 public sessions are toxic people will kill you they will destroy your supplies they will go out of their way to piss you off and make things even harder for you bottom line if you are buying the game in hope for a nice online experience i would strongly recommand you dont buy it you wont be missing out on anything on the contrary you will dodge so much headache and fraustration well done greedy r
