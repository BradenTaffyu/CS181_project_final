2023 there s no good time to increase prices and we have not taken this step lightly however this is the business reality of supporting warhammer iii and ensuring we re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned i feel the sentiment is shared across the vast majority of folks who left reviews after ca decided to send that message out it doesn t take much to read between the lines at this time i would not recommend this game even at a deep discount you will find a better value with twii to include dlc that is priced more appropriately that also includes more sustenance
