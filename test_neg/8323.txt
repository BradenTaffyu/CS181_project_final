2020 early access review the core gameplay is fine and the game may seem fun for a first couple of days but then problems become apparent the main one is there s too much randomness no matter how hard you try to beat the game random events always can screw up your run sometimes worms show up and anger the gods without your intervention sometimes a random ukko stun locks you from the dark and sometimes the game refuses to give you any decent wands if luck is not on your side your skills and tactics eventually become irrelevant level layouts are frustrating contain lots and lots of dead ends and require constant backtracking especially in early stages most of them essentially resemble labyrinths with no structure or plan so navigation attempts turn into meaningless random wandering the absence of a map doesn t help as well all seeing eye makes things better but it s pretty rare land exploration is boring due to large distances and overall emptiness there s no portals or waypoints to help you revisit places you ve been to and teleportation wands aren t a good replacement some world regions are boundless and if you wander far enough the game may crash as far as i can see this game is suitable either for absolutely hardcore players who are willing to invest large amounts of time in it or for very casual players who simply enjoy simulation and physics and do not care about beating the game only 13 of players killed the final boss which kinda proves my words
