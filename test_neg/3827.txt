2015 welcome to 2015 where cops just spawn in front of you from thin air first of all i enjoyed the game both single and online but there are just some so dumb things in the game that makes me so sad it could ve been a so much better experience with more caring about the little things nice delays tho cons online p2p servers in itself it wouldn t be a problem but for some reason me and my buddies always get thrown in a horribly lagging session with a guy being host with horrible connection the cop system is extremly dumb just randomly appear in the nowhere i was in front of a mountain then i saw a cop just spawn there and continue to chase me aight a one star chase can be longer then a five star one that s pretty legit you get banned for using mods any mods basically fov adjuster because you can set your fov to 70 75 at max that s you get banned if you use mods single or online so there goes that because of p2p servers most of the times you can empty a magazine into a person and take a whole zero damage and then all you can see is he hits you once and you re dead basically until the mod ban thing there were no anti cheat system because of p2p servers sometimes mechanic doesn t seem to care about you shatting on your head even if he had his payment singleplayer i feel like the graphics options on itself is useless just like in watch dogs i get the same fps on 800x600 lowest settings then on 1920x1080 everything high how is that possible even the vehicles you buy you have to take care of them otherwise you just lose them afaik there s no option like online to get it back sadly sometimes random events one npc stole money from another etc are just straight up not working you return the stuff the npc that got robbed just despawns though it s rare cons that are common in both single and online you can t aim straight up that is really dumb the fps mode because of the low fov can easily cause motion sickness first game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that i played on the other hand pros online fun online if you re getting paired with a good host different races land bike sea plane theft protection and insurance this is what the singplayer is missing if your vehicle gets destroyed you can just call mmi and they ll provide you with the same car usually other players blow up your car in that case if it has both protection and insurance they ll pay some money 1 of the car s price and you can call mmi to get it back free mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call and decides to not be lazy pretty neat character creation you can create unique characters with it payout is quite good for the effort reward system heists are fun with pretty good payout depending on difficulty and on host how he sets the payout on the last day of the heist in heists it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed if you have no team lives left and someone dies the three can t clutch it because the heist will fail single loveable characters hateable kids i m looking at you jimmy the story mode is pretty fun it has it s own moments you can chose out of a three possible ending two of them affects the endgame assasination missions with franklin let s you play stock market in your favour it is quite op actually but hey it s single so it could be either con or pro depending on which side of you are the autosave function in missions are quite casual friendly usually if you do something in a mission and you happen to die or fail with the objective you ll be booted back to that part or a bit earlier after you done the main story there s still a lot stuff to do if you haven t done it while playing the story already and have chosen the third option as of the ending mission if i were to press myself i could still write a lot to the pro con side i think they even themselves out though the fov and the cop system is a really big downer overall i d say i m recommending the game and at the same time not it s fun but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if you d just like to hop in and play a few contact missions or heists for tl dr people buy this game at your own risk don t expect high quality online servers it s fun if you get lucky with a host isn t worth 60 euros in my eyes though as of being already an almost 2 years old game and it s painfully obvious flaws cheers
