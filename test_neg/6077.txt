2018 i ve spent about 300 hours on ps4 and roughly half of that on steam typically each season i have been high tier survivor and mid to high killer i can t recomend this game to anyone there s obviously a love hate to the game but this final straw is this emblem system the community is unbearably toxic the devs consistantly take the game in the wrong direction people ruin your game be it selfish clueless teammates or cheap killers watching the dev stream shows how out of touch they are as there are serious issues with mechanics and balance and they ignore them constantly insidous killers hiding in the basement face camping and op killers ruin it for survivors trolling survivors who run 1 perk because they think they re great and consistant pallet looping and purple flashlights ruin it for average killers honestly this game was much better shortly after launch than it is now high tier players are intentionally de ranking just to find games because it s impossible for casual players to rank up now these devs are clueless and the community just adds insult to injury the frustration just isn t worth the time que the thinks this is funny nerdsedit they ve updated the emblem system much more balanced and easier to rank up edit 2 it s 2k19 and this game somehow got worse the new killer is actually broken the perk reworking has made the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer the community is just as brain dead as ever i just had a game with a teammate from germany and also one from mexico in the same lobby doing a pretty good job so far i d say
