2022 my review and experience of the game so far about 50 hours overall negative until more fixes are implemented ghost is currently useless and suppressors have even less appeal because you will show up on radar between sweeps when firing a weapon with ghost and a suppressor classic terrible call of duty spawns have returned in this game and i am so excited i love spawning in the enemy spawn and dying to someone right around the corner because i am on the other side of the map where my team is i have a clip of myself shooting an enemy in a corner and my teammate spawning on top of their dead corpse in the middle of the map if you are getting spawn trapped the game will keep spawning you in the same place allowing the enemy to feed kills off of your team either people are already wall hacking or smoke is client sided i have died a lot due to smoke after a kill streak clouding my view only to watch the kill cam and see my opponent look at my character as if it was a bright and sunny day out ui is terrible and buggy sometimes your are unable to edit your gun mid match and you have to select the gun back out of the gun selection and then click edit to edit your attachments and by then you have died 2 times to the enemy the game backs out of the gunsmith after every match several times causing you to have to navigate to the menu and wasting precious time between matches to equip a new weapon if you are in a party you can bet on someone either crashing or getting kicked out of the party randomly no one plays the objective in objective based game modes it is already over 1 week after release and i am being put in lobbies with everyone on the enemy team using meta weapons while i am struggling to upgrade the weapons that i have don t play invasion unless you are the rooftop camper if you are i hate you most guns are good stock adding all 5 attachments ruins most guns which defeats the purpose of the gunsmith battle hardened is useless against flash grenades and stuns unless you are the enemy because they are immune to your stuns and flash grenades controller aim assist extremely strong you can have maximum sensitivity and get a strong lock on your opponent a second later with precision aim and all of your shot landing unbind dolphin dive and slide keys they will get you killed more often than help your movement stuns and flash grenades don t work on controller players because their aim hacks will do the work for them if someone with a higher kd is in your party you will be matched into their skill bracket and get destroyed by adderall controller users playing core feels like i am playing hardcore i can t wait to get one shot by every weapon in hardcore update after another 90 hours overall negative until more fixes are implemented dmz restarts my entire computer if i start a match with two different tiers of objectives for example if i have a tier 2 objective and a tier 3 objective and i start to matchmake it will restart my computer the same thing happens if my team mate has a similar objective set up you can reliably crash if your team mate crashes mid dmz game warzone is filled with rooftop snipers and everyone and their mother is going after safe cracker and intel contracts thanks youtube sbmm is cranked up to 11 in multiplayer if your party does the objective and anyone goes positive you can expect to play against the next pro players in your matches we even had people wall hacking and aim hacking in some of our lobbies dmz is one of the only stress free modes that you can relax and have fun in you can even recruit up to a party of 6 random people the buggy ui is still persistent you still have issues using gunsmith mid multiplayer match and if you start a match your teammates will be kicked out of their loadout and gunsmith screens but hey they patched a harmless xp glitch that helps you level up your weapons a bit faster instead of fixing a broken ui since launch the battlepass tokens will sometimes never show up and you have to restart the game to see your total tokens sometimes the tokens wont even work when you try to use them tier 1 is a terrible replacement of hardcore you can t see the kill feed and you can t see your kill streaks and i have not seen anyone get punished for killing teammates to use double xp in dmz you have to back out and get into the warzone game mode or multiplayer game mode and then activate your double xp there is still no xp timer to see how much time you have left for your double xp tokens
