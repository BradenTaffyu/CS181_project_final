2022 this is just a review for the campaign it s a very underwhelming one especially compared to mw 2019 s felt very average and by the numbers even for call of duty it s story lost me completely around the halfway mark it has mediocre mission structure and level design lack of set pieces and just interesting moments in general there are some cool missions here and there but a lot of them again feel by the numbers and some are very short they feel like they end before they even begin some other missions feel horribly paced like the all ghillied up redo where it looks like it takes place in the corner of a new warzone map or that highway chase where it just goes on forever there just feels like a lack of effort in general in this one like they cared less some design decisions just left me questioning what they were thinking like the armoured enemies that appear in almost every mission of the game they were never fun to fight and they were pretty frustrating a lot of the time on veteran difficulty also that half baked crafting system that s used briefly in two missions or that awful tank boss battle overall another year another average cod campaign 5 10 average
