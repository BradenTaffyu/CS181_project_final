2017 so i ll start by saying that i love this game then why am i not recommending it here it is i play as much survivor as killer have fun on both i never camp as a killer nor do i tbag as a survivor but good lord a lot of ppl facecamp in this game and it s killing the fun of it the killer hooks you then waits for others to come save you to get his kills devs say it s a strategy like any other but where is the fun there i don t have fun doing that as a killer again i don t and you re definitely not gonna have any funpkaying it as a survivor seriously i still play it a bit due to friends but there far better games where devs do their job oh and reporting in game is useless as they said they won t take them into any consideration you need to send them an e mail with a video of whatever you re reporting like we all record our games gg devs gg
