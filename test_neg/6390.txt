2020 honestly i would recommend this game but the machmaking is so horrible that it makes no sense for new players as surviver you run into rank 5 and up killers or as killer you run into premades that makes the game hell for you either way there is no fun for newbies once you played 80 hours you kinda get used to all the crap the game machanic throws at you but people that just now picked up the game will not even play that long also so many people just dc it is insane all in all it is a fun game for people that have been playing a while but the matchmaking has to get fixed otherwise this game will die out
