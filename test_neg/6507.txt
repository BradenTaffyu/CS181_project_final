2018 i love this game i truly do however i have to leave a negative rating just simply because of how horrible the matchmaking can be and how it mostly is if you play survivor you will probably get matched up against a killer who is incredibly amazing and kills everyone without breaking a sweat on the other hand when you play as a killer you will have to deal with survivors who pallet loop use flashlights 360 you and teabag every time you have to break a pallet or when they re at the exit and they just stand there taunting you because they know you can t do anything and they want to make your experience as horrible as possible that s the issue with this game is the terribly toxic people who play it whether it is a killer who is face camping you or a survivor who is pallet looping using a flashlight or 360ing you you can t win this will be the downfall of this game if behaviour doesn t do something to fix this as i previously stated i love this game but god most of the people who play it completely ruin it
