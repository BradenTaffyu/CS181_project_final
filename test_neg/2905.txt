2020 the singleplayer is great worth a try for me the best story rockstar managed to tell at this point singleplayer of gta v won everything it could win so there s not much to discuss about it however the multiplayer is just a mess there is definitely fun to have there with friends but every time i decided to join a game a full list of problems pops up most sessions are filled with cheaters they either will turn you into a giant orange bomb everybody on the server from an invincible flying submarine and once in a blue moon they will ignore you or even have fun with the game without annoying everybody on the server some people aren t necessarily cheating but buying these awful flying motorcycles that can spam rockets and kill basically anyone who isn t specifically prepared for encounter with these trolls i am baffled that rockstar provided them with a legit tool to harass everybody in the session everything is confusing starting from gathering a team of 4 players in 1 session to making a decision about what is worth buying or not for example i mistakenly bought a high level property thinking that it would give me access to heists but it turned out that it s basically useless until you pour into it 5x money that it s worth for it to return a noticable profit the motorcycle clubs vip and ceo as methods of creating groups are explained extremely poorly and i still don t see a reason why can t they function as clans in any standard mmo half the time me my friends have troubles logging into sessions or online at all every now and then somebody randomly disconnects or the whole session goes offline for no apparent reason game can hang during loading and mess up the mission progress for everybody else every time you login to session prepare for 3 9 voice calls from npcs nagging to you about uninteresting stuff side quests for killing npcs missions about selling cars and other busy work single player contained most of these but for some reason did not need to bother me every day with messages about them aside from heists and generic multiplayer stuff races deathmatches most of the time you wouldn t be actually playing the game for fun most of the time is spent doing busywork selling product from your businesses promoting your nightclub taking supplies to your businesses this is because heists require a significant amount of money to prepare for them buying property that gives access to it and most of the time you need to also pay initial price so the profit will be given after 3 6 missions depending on heist getting to a highlevel heist such as casino feels like playing a mobile city building game you have to log in each day to not miss the daily objectives to get 30k you have to spin the casino wheel for a chance of 10 50k you provide your businesses with stuff and sell stuff this will result in 3 5 trips around the city just riding bike or car nothing else the more you have stuff the more you have to ride it feels exhausting the impression from gta online is that of an old mmorpg but with a dozen disadvantages from a regular mmo the game is clearly designed to force you into the loop of unnecessary boring busywork padding out interesting content while forcing you to spend real money on shark cards that would free you up of this busywork it s a shame since i don t know any other game that gives you ability to do heists with this amount of choices by the mission design and by inherent fact that you are playing gta and can go off the rails most of the time
