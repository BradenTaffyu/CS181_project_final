2020 has become the most boring tedious grind ever the sole purpose left is to sell shark cards to naiv players with decent pc hardware and a 100mbit connection the loading time and server stability is unacceptable from what i can tell you spent at least 25 of your time on stupid load screens which basically show adds for shark cards once you managed to join a lobby you ll usually find a a mix of people who should not engage in a pvp focused online game at all autoaim tryhards with all their noobbike deluxo cancer modders and cheaters good lord what happens here is mind numbing while other people pay real money for ingame cash a single lucky session with the right cheater can easily bring you the equivalent of a few hundret bucks and thats not even talking about the common unlock all offers and the over 9000 money glitches you can find on youtube this is straight up fraud to everyone who ever paid a single doller for ingame currency in this respect this is by far the worst i ve seen yet in the pay to win department try to start a new account from scratch no buying cards no using glitches no help from cheaters it s not fun it s an unplayable steaming pile of bu sh which everybody at rockstar should be ashame of nohopeforgta6
