2023 i have to say i m deeply disappointed with the direction rainbow six siege has taken especially since the release of ela the game used to rely on strategy communication and careful planning but with ela the delicate balance that made siege stand out among other shooters has been disturbed turning it into something more like a standard run and gun title but my biggest gripe the real knife to the heart is the mishandling of the character havoc havoc was teased in the game s e3 trailer portrayed as this intriguing menacing character who was supposed to bring an exciting twist to the game the trailer did an excellent job of building hype around havoc the character s design menacing aura and what appeared to be a unique gameplay mechanic the trailer painted a vivid picture of havoc as a new villain a ruthless operator who seemed to be bringing a new level of intensity and danger to siege it suggested that his arrival would significantly shake up the game s dynamics posing new challenges and creating fresh strategies for players to explore however this was all a pipe dream despite all the hype despite all the anticipation built up havoc is nowhere to be found in the actual game it s a classic case of false advertising and has left many fans including me feeling betrayed we were promised something exciting something groundbreaking but what we got was a no show and if the mishandling of havoc wasn t enough the writing has also gone down the drain exemplified by the addition of dokkaebi her bio intro is just cringeworthy her fingers dance across the keyboard the light of the lcd screen underscoring her smirk it s a cheesy line that feels out of place and makes her character feel shallow and uninspired it s not the level of writing one would expect from a game with the pedigree of rainbow six siege it s hard not to feel misled and deceived the absence of havoc in the game is like a promising movie trailer with no actual film to follow it s like being served a mouthwatering menu with no food to eat it s not just about one character it s about broken promises and shattered expectations the game has deviated from its roots focusing on quick action and flashy gimmicks rather than on deep tactical gameplay the introduction of ela the misleading portrayal of havoc and the cringe worthy writing for dokkaebi have made siege lose its identity and it s a real shame in conclusion if you loved rainbow six siege for its strategic depth teamwork and engaging characters you might want to give it a miss for now unless the developers make a u turn and steer the game back to its roots it s hard to see this title reclaiming its former glory so until then i can t recommend this game
