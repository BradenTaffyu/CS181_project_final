cannot recommend the game in it s current release state pros first off followed by cons 1 the game actually runs well at high framerates optimization isn t a big issue here 2 gunplay ttk are good recoil can be felt guns feel good to use not some shoddy cod shooter with 0 2s hipfire spray ttk the player s ability to aim well is rewarded here 3 the game s audio feels meaty heavy and relatively realistic believable 4 pve melee combat can t say much about it because i prefer to shoot things but it works well in pve feels like they ve combined valheim with dark souls 5 customization follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements some of the best of any warhammer game i ve played 6 environment the maps are pretty with effort and work put into them cons 1 pve co op campaign ques are still bugged for me personally though they work for most people i am unable to start any pve or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no ui after a black screen the solution proposed by a comment in the review does work but it doesn t change the fact that it s still bugged edit 9 09 2024 2 pvp que limitations can only bring at most two friends into pvp on the upside you can t guild stack pvp lobbies 3 pvp class balance i m just gonna say it mid at best at higher levels the jpa s practically worthless the bulwark s relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless melee s just plain bad 4 lack of content the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete there are 8 replayable pve operations which is where the bulk of this game s content is shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades class weapon perks you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new if you don t care much for that you could play through all of the game s content within half a day on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine less walking less talking more shooting 5 pve ai squaddies while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn t need the armor regeneration they overall fall short they re not great at fighting back against the hordes and most of the time don t cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless 6 class selection limitations done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand however there s no support for people that want to play a specific class no ability to pre select the class you desire to play prior to queuing and having mm filtered to suit your selection 7 easy anti cheat it s awful and players have already cracked it players running around with infinite grenades trainer like cheats etc 8 lack of shoulder camera swap for pvp it s all about right angle peaks tl dr overall it s a solid core game once the release bugs get ironed out and some more content comes out i could definitely recommend this just not in it s current release state
