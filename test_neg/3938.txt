2017 my friend and i have both been banned several times from online by the automated ban system despite not having been cheating or playing unfairly now with the revised auto ban system my friend was banned once again during a casual game only this time it was a perma ban with appeals no longer possible thanks to the amazing rockstar he is unable to play online at all this was the second time he d purchased the game for this reason basically the online automatic banning system is completely messed up and has repeatedly caused enormous headache though the game can be fun it tends to be more infuriating than anything
