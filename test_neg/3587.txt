2017 this garbage with open iv is ridiculous mods are one if not the largest aspect of pc gaming out there nad then you try to pull this type of mess during e3 hoping that no one would noticed well obviously it didn t work instead of making more money grabbing stuff on gta online how about making the single player at least as fleshed out as gta 4 was you can t even go into a burger shot anymore to heal but you can add vehicles to online that still aren t even available in the single player where you get so much money at the end that you have nothing to spend it on
