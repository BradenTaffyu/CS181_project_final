i recently jumped back into online mostly private lobbies cause i dont like dealing with people and was enjoying some new content working towards maybe getting myself a fancy new helicopter imagine rockstar greeting me with a giant middle finger of course representing the 1 69 update not only did they add an anti cheat people have already found ways around but in doing so they have removed linux support you may think hey its not their fault linux has no anti cheat support thing is we do its as simple as checking add linux proton support saying we can no longer support linux is simply 100 a straight up lie theres no world in which they can in good faith say this it s sad to say goodbye to a game i played with all my friends but since most of them can t play them too anyways due to this i ll have to find new games to fill the 112 gb hole in my sd card heck you rockstar even when you decide to release gta6 on pc because let s be honest you will i will not be getting it i won t even accept gift copies and even if you reverse this no linux decision i will likely not be returning do better
