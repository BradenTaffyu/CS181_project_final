2023 development is to this day really slow but thats not the biggest issue the biggest issue is their dlc policy which is ridiculous its on paar with paradox selling minor content sometimes essential for a faction for 40 of the base games price and the worst thing is that there are whales who allow this behaviour to happen saying things like ehm are you poor or something no im not poor just not stupid enough to pay 25 for a barebones dlc if youre a manchild who lives with their parents you dont really have to worry about money that much but if you have a car or house to pay off maybe even a family with children then you definitelly won t pay that kind of money for mere dlc to this day i havent bought chaos dwarfs nor shadows of change and i still won t until it will be 10 or less i encourage everyone to do the same
