2020 i have 615 hours at the time of writing this review siege has been out for five years now and i just played it for around 7 months straight i have a lot of memories of the first four or five months really enjoying the game learning the game was awesome and i never really got too aggravated but the more you play the more you realize how bad the game becomes it all starts after you unlock all the operators congratulations nothing is new anymore that s okay you can focus on mastering a few then you start to get good you climb ranks get out of bronze or silver and start playing against some decent players here things start to fall downhill you ll frag and do good a lot of games but then you reach a hard sweat point around platinum whether it s ranked or silent mmr you reach a point at which you have to dedicate every moment of your day to playing this game to be decent at it in comparison to the people you play against don t do that this game becomes incapable of being casual at that point the development team is too slow to introduce enough new content to continue making the game feel new fresh and fun the game in it s current state needs to be reworked so far it needs a new engine new mechanics and complete new revision in it s current state this game cannot be a ten year game like the developers want it to here is my advice play this game if you want a game to play for around 350 hours max while having fun play with friends the competitive scene here will die soon as players become increasingly disappointed with the quality of the game additionally cheating is a huge problem ubisoft overlooks my advice to the studio rework the damn game put some effort in if you actually want a ten year game the game has so much potential to be fun and ambitious and if the studio wants to start investing and dedicating to the game enough to take advantage of the potential this could easily become truly one of the greatest games in history until then a lot needs to change i really hope it does because i love this game
