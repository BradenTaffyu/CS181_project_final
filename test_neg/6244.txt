this game used to be so fun if you want to play a few matches and then get so frustrated you want to uninstall this game and never play it again go ahead and buy this game save your self from this toxic relationship and stay away the only thing that keeps anyone from coming back is that is it really the only asymmetrical multiplayer horror game that is decent other than that be prepared for a deep breathing and whoosahing the dbd community is also super toxic so both survivor and killer behavior mid game play is just annoying cheating killers and self survivors are quite popular you can be a skilled gamer but if you get paired up with teammates whose only motive is to survive and escape then you are out of luck looped the killer for all five gens then get camped on hook in end game yay do all five gens while other survivors hide and teebag the killer only to die in end game because no one wanted to unhook you yay get tunneled from the start of the game only to play for a whooping 3 mins yay playing as a new killer because the survivors are crappy team mates be prepared to be teebaged at every pallet and window vault it used to be random match making which made it fair now they claim its based on hrs or win lose ratio bull the match making is trash and so is this game deuces
