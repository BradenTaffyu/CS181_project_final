2022 don t bother anymorethis game was a gem years ago seasons 1 6 were honestly a blast game felt refreshing and there was a larger player base so you weren t put up with people on the top if you weren t on the topit started going downhill on season 7 the content was great sure but the player base started to dwindle somewhere around season 11 12 things hit the fan and you started seeing 3 stack predators in normal lobbies i think this was something they did with ranked it hasn t really recovered the game has gotten stale respawn is a shell of what it used to be if your looking for a shooter i reckon to say that this isn t a good place to start i have tried multiple times to get back into this game following season 12 but to no avail each session was just met with more and more frustration as me and my friends arguably middle golds were consistently matched against high diamonds masters and the occasional predators in both ranked and unranked skill based matchmaking is no longer a solid thing i m afraid and you cant improve if you get gunned down the moment somebody sees you that and ea respawn have been shifting more and more away from interesting gameplay and more and more into recycled content to sell more skins ontop of butchering existing and established ideas to be politically correct occasionally when you can find less sweaty lobbies it s still a good time killer titanfall2 s online features can be accessed with the northstar client look it up
