2023 i have never been let down by a game development company so much in my life and i used to play heroes and generals the balance just doesn t exist anymore everything survivors had going for them is just ruined sprint burst practically one of the most unused perks i ve seen as killer besides a few people every so often yet somehow it is now the meta because the devs went out of their way to make every perk they had going for them worthless beyond a few percentage boosts here and there the meta is literally just and only run away now as a killer main it s too east now it s like the devs literally destroyed the game from the ground up to cater to the role they like to play and feel like god but now it s so mind numbingly easy it s just not fun no challenge what so ever the kpop killer who has every right being nerfed into the ground practically out of existence instead gets a item buff this patch the easiest killer in the game that makes people dc constantly bro what not to mention just the newer designs of the killers just looks like a demigorgon asset flip and a deviantart oc from 2017 i have played this game since 2016 i told every friend about this game and bought over 7 copies for other friends who all played and loved it and to see it just get reduced to this garbage is just disappointing i can go on about the newer map designs being as horrid as they are to all the changes made but honestly it s just not worth it this honestly feels like robocraft all over again not to mention i m seeing a dev in full blown drag makeup with a cheap bright orange wig and using a fake gay accent it s honestly just disrespectful and sad given this time a month when companies do disingenuous things like that on the daily i ve never gone out of my way to write a review but i m honestly just devastated what my once favorite game has become every time i come back it just gets worse the meta is always constantly changing to always suit the killers it now just feels like a game with a streamer only difficulty mode so you never look dumb playing killer i have rarely seen any nerfs for killers and when they do it practically changes nothing edit i later found out they use the dev streams as a way to promote the community my opinion on drag was not against drag itself rather against a dev impersonating it i have later found this to not be the case and would like to apologize for that view however i still stand with everything else and wish the devs would make it clear the dev streams are not being used as what it is a dev stream
