2020 great asymmetrical game fun cat and mouse game built upon character based perks worst problem with the game which ruins the experience is the community as you get into the higher ranks which is basically synonymous with the more you play the more the players become toxic gameplay and attitude wise i highly suggest this game for an occasional play but the more you play the more you ll come to be dissatisfied with your experience best bet is to grab 4 other friends and have a good hide and seek game with them to avoid all the toxicity
