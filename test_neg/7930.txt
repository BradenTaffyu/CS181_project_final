2021 sea of thieves is completely unplayable if what you most want in the world is a game that allows you to team up with your friends and be a jerk harassing and interfering with the play of other players without any in game justification this is the game for you if like me you thought it would be possible to play the pve elements of this game that are so heavily advertised in its trailers you are wrong skip it the trailer you may note suggests indulging in some pvp in the arena which you might think means this game like most games has a dedicated pvp experience but you would be wrong the adventure mode features pvp as well is that so awful yes it is unless literally your only interest is in pvp it is awful skip it there are a variety of quest types available including the long story focused tall tales all of which are in the format go to island explore island do thing on island therefore what every single quest has in common is getting off your boat as a solo player or part of a two man crew this ended in death by pvp every single time online guides tell me that once the enemy is aboard your ship you have lost therefore never leave your ship that rings true since literally every time my friend and i got out on an island to kill skeletons or collect gold as suggested both by the built in quests and the marketing for the game an enemy crew appeared to kill us take all our accumulated loot and generally spawn kill us for however long it took to sink our ship ah you say they stole your accumulated loot what a great pirate game and you would be wrong because having no loot in fact being obviously freshly spawned with nothing on the ship of any value didn t prevent spawn camping by enemy players for so far as i can tell no purpose other than to enjoy being jerks this is a pirate game says the chorus of griefers so invested in the jerk status quo if you re getting sunk it s because you re bad yeah nah this is pretty simple if you re attacked when you re not on your boat you ve already lost if you get attacked first you ve already lost if you get attacked by a powerful galleon crewed by four people while you are in a sloop alone or with a friend you ve already lost the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that makes it possible to succeed as a single player against even a marginally competent crew the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that makes it possible to complete the many pve quests without your quest loot being stolen and your ship destroyed the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that prevents enemy players from hanging out on your boat and spawn killing you over and over until they get bored or you get frustrated and sink your own ship for the privilege of being teleported across the map to be harassed by other jerk players in some other part of the world if getting sunk and having your session progress reset to zero were an occasional experience that would be fine if there were the slightest hope of defending yourself that would be fine if it were at all possible to complete the adventure goals this game is sold on without getting killed that would be fine but none of those things is true instead you are either all in for a full crew pvp experience or you are screwed if you have any interest in any of the game elements advertised in the many trailers you are screwed in short if you want to play this game at all outside the very narrow mode of gameplay favored by the griefing pvp community of this game you are screwed the commentary surrounding this problem with the game design is depressingly homogenous people like me point out that if you re interested in playing the game as advertised you can t because of the endless griefer parade approximately thirty milliseconds later said griefers appear to insist well actually it s a pirate game and you can t grief other players because that s just how it works we re pirates and under their logic hanging around on a treasure less ship to spawn kill the noob crew over and over and over until they scuttle their ship is somehow being a pirate so if you re a jerk and you re looking for an online arena to be a jerk with your jerk friends and generally make a miserable gameplay experience for random strangers look no further sea of thieves is the game for you if you want a game that allows the sorts of high seas adventures and skeleton battles and exploring promised in the game trailers and you think you ought to be able to do those things without being swarmed by jerks every thirty seconds and killed repeatedly just for jerks sheer joy at knowingly ruining your game session find some other game sea of thieves is for jerks and it seems the devs are all in on mandatory jerk gameplay so unless you re a jerk skip it
