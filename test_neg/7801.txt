2021 this game thoroughly demonstrates why i don t like pvp i ll get to that in a minute or two sea of thieves is a pirate simulator full of things to see and do if you can find the time to enjoy them in peace it s a fusion of pvp and pve but there s a fair amount wrong with that which i ll cover later there are 3 types of ships accommodating crews of 1 to 4 players the sloop is a small ship that is slow yet agile and easy to manage this is the best option by far for solo players and supports up to 2 people the brigantine is larger and faster but is much harder to manage not only having more sails than a sloop but also taking longer to adjust anything on board minimum 2 players recommended supports up to 3 finally the galleon is the fastest and most heavily armed ship but turns slowly and needs at least 3 crew members to reach full potential while it supports up to 4 the pve gameplay consists of finding loot via voyages basically quests consisting of delivering cargo digging up chests and killing skeletons lying around in the water or stashed away on islands or looted from special encounters or other players the voyages are fun and enjoyable and the seafaring is artfully simplistic yet satisfying the time it takes to sail between islands can leave you idle for a while especially while sailing against the wind the pvp elements are where the game begins to fall apart the world is open and shared with up to 4 other ships at all times these ships are free to attack and sink you at any time for any reason causing you to effectively lose everything you had on board at the time barring some edge cases this means that at any time you can be attacked and robbed of all the loot you had stashed on board making frequent trips back to the outposts a necessity to minimize losses you are free to fight back of course but that s where the real problems start to come in first sea battles are long and drawn out cannonballs cause holes in the hull which starts to fill the ship with water but at any time a crew member can use a plank of which every ship starts with 15 and more are easily found throughout the world and take a few seconds to patch the hole bailing the water out is even easier and one person can do it as fast or faster than the ship can fill this makes ship to ship combat a game of attrition with overwhelming and sinking the opponent only occuring when they run out of resources or are solo and get knocked off the ship or die this leads many people to skip the ship to ship and go straight to crew to crew mainly in the form of spawncamping spawncamping is far and away the best strategy to sink a ship once you have one person on board and get the upper hand all you have to do is wait for the ship to go under and kill them every time they respawn respawning comes with a hefty lag spike and that combined with the disorientation can get you caught in a death loop the worst part is that this isn t penalized or punished at all it s the only legitimate strategy because you can t actually steal anything from the enemy ship because the respawn timers are too short to load more than 2 or 3 items but far and away the worst part is the toxic people that pvp environments attract there are people who will pursue you across the map for no reason people who will hunt you down over and over for no reason and people who will fix your sinking ship just so they can spawncamp you more none of this is penalized the only punishable offense is using slurs or hate speech in the text voice chat it s called sea of thieves not sea of friends they ll say i say that there s surprisingly little thieving going on it s all murder because of the fusion between pve and pvp it s worse than usual because now trolls can force you to participate in content you dislike as opposed to just being a poor sportsman and actively prevent you from playing the content you do like by chasing you across the map and back for no reason there is no thievery in sea of thieves in my 130 hours i have been stolen from twice robbed once and had non hostile encounters with other crews 4 times every other encounter dozens has gone immediately to a firefight that ended in someone being spawncamped it s not possible to avoid fights either sloops sail fastest against the wind but fastest is infinitesimally faster than the second fastest ship unless you want to get a spot on a galleon with at least 2 other people you re going to get caught or at the very least chased until all your playtime has melted away the toxicity seeps into the forums too the sheer mention of wanting to not experience the pvp content gets you called anything from a noob to a moron to a the community comes up with new ways to mock pve enjoyers every day none of that really matters to me the sheer aura of stress and paranoia alone is enough to turn me off of this game everything else is just another nail in the coffin
