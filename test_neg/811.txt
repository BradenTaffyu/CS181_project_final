2017 this game became a full trash i call it cheaterland now first when it came out it was okay but still worse than cs 1 6 after some updates it became cool pro scene started it s expansion sometimes there was cheaters back there but some were banned right away in 2017 it became totally unplayable with cheaters in all games whole teams using wh s and aim s so it s possible to get some rounds with luck but no fun at all every game that we start we are afraid of getting cheaters again not even possible to relax or play like a casual human deletedvalve valve good luck with dota 2 tournaments and mass 7 1 updates instead of fixind your own anticheat oh yea forgot prime big great system that supposed to help biggest mistake link you phone aaaaaaaaand you still get cheaters
