after 450 hours and the new major content patch 1 1 i just uninstalled i mean for a major patch it delivered like 30 minutes of new content and that is it they time gated the new descendatn halley behind a 12 day mnimum wait they lied about better rewards for the battle pass they lied about making weekly chalenges easier they removed timed events inside dungeons just to implement a way worse mechanic in dungeon invasions and the worst part is the grind is pointless as there are no raids or co op callenging dungeons or really any type of endgame worth the grind
