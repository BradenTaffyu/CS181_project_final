2017 grand theft auto 5 in my opinion is the best open world game ever made just cause 3 is a close second i think the gta series as a whole is fantastic but i have to give this game a negative review for the following reasons 1 the online mode is a micro transaction hell but if you avoid paying for anything with real money online is still very fun for doing races stunt races and heists with friends 2 rockstar did a great job making the pc port of this game but any issues that alot of people are still having have never been fixed since day 1 they really don t give a about fixing the technical problems for pc 3 taketwo interactive the company that owns rockstar has sent a cease desist to the creators of openiv the backbone for modding in gta v and gta iv so if you re looking to mod the singleplayer you re basically out of luck unless you already have it see this video for more information youtube video nerd breaking news rip gta mods 1997 2017 views 398 735 an extra point to add that i forgot to mention is that of course this letter may be a fake however coming from the recent statements of take two ceo which jim sterling covers over here 4 there have been an increasing number of people getting banned in online for no reason whatsoever and when you get banned from online that s it there s like a 0 01 chance you ll get unbannedi personally don t really care for mods apart from the mods that improve the graphics but until the state of modding the single player is back to normal i cannot reccomend this game in the slightest
