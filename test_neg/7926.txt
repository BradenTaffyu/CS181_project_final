2021 it s far far too easy for trolls in a giant galleon to relentlessly hound players in smaller ships preventing them from doing anything in the game besides running away and being sunk even when they gain nothing no treasure on the ship no rewards nothing there s literally no way to escape no way to defend when you re completely outgunned and no way to switch servers to get away they simply sail around with the sole intent of ruining others gameplay reaping no benefit for themselves i can be fine with being attacked for my treasure it s a pirate game that s what pirates do but when i have absolutely nothing on board and i m hounded by trolls who follow my ship sink me repeatedly and won t talk or negotiate nope either give us better options for reporting or blocking those types of players make pvp zoned or in separate servers or give us the option to move to another server so we can enjoy the beautiful graphics questlines and pve elements
