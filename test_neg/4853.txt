this launcher is absolutely terrible utterly annoying an insurmountable pain in the ass in order to play the bo6 open beta i had to do the following download the bo6 open beta which also downloaded mw2 mp which i own open the call of duty launcher restart the launcher because of an update after which it started crashing after a few tries i managed to start the launcher once again after which it required another restart finally i managed to arrive in the interface where i could select black ops 6 open beta which i did the call of duty launcher closed and bo6 started loading after bo6 loaded it required another restart because of an update after the restart i got an error regarding the loading of player stats which forced me to quit to desktop how the hell is this possible even if i somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo why would i buy this abomination if i have to go through such a hassle in order to play it i will probably uninstall mw2 perhaps this will help because otherwise i have to go through almost the same process once again edit so i managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players it is quite enjoyable however i would still not recommend it after every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the cod launcher and selecting bo6 which closes the cod launcher and opens bo6 it s stupid that they did not change this since mw1 reboot at least make it check for the update and restart it faster perhaps upon opening the launcher not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens
