this game is like the movie rebel moon beautiful well done visuals but everything else is pointless let s ignore the poor performance and microtransactions which warrants a thumbs down on its own i don t care that they don t really effect gameplay they shouldn t be a thing in the first place pros beautiful game gameplay identical to the first pawn systemcons everything elsegame is unfinished pulls you in with a super well done and intriguing plot in the beginning then you leave and it just skips to the last quest it will have you going but what about x y and z why is x happening is this supposed to be epic why do i care very little enemy variety the enemies in the second zone are just furrier and have more hpless fashiongame is too easythe voice of that one mercenary guy is terrible just terrible i don t know what to say other than what a shame i ll still play a bit more but maybe i ll go back to dark arisen in other words this is the most 10 10 6 10 game everupdate i just discovered there s a post game after the game begged me not to start ng i shouldn t have to google how to obtain post game your pawn should tell you or something the premise is interesting and should just be part of the main story and not labeled as post game my review and opinion is unchanged
