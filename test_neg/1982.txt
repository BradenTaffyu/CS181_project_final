2022 all the negative reviews that cite the issue with chinese players ruining the game for the na eu audience could not be more true i read them bought the game anyway to give it a shot and your very first public match you ll be greeted to just how bad it is trying to play against someone from china using a vpn you can t hit them you can t counter them and they ll land 100 of their abilities on you no problem the fact that more of an effort hasn t been taken to remove these players using vpn s lag switches and other nefarious methods to get the upper hand in this game shows just how little the dev s care about porting this game to the west it s to the point when you queue into a match just look for the players with chinese characters in their name and you ll already find the winners of each round couple the above with the fact that this game is basically a melee clone of apex legends with a generic eastern theme and suffers from the same lack of new maps any that apex did for months means you ll get tired of the same play each time if getting face rolled for hours on end by chinese players in an apex knockoff battle royal game is your jam then 10 10 this is for you for everyone else thats sane and isn t a masochist look elsewhere update 12 feb 23 at the urging of a friend i picked this game back up because he said and i quote they changed the game a lot it s a lot more friendly to new players now allow me to enlighten you all to what new player friendly is for this game developer there s now a rating system for ranked matches think arena rating and mmr from like wow if you played you start of at like bronze v and work your way down numerically v iv iii ii i etc until you re in the next bracket so on and so forth in theory this means you re only supposed to go against other players around your same mmr hence keeping the chinese players that have no life d this game from its inception out of your games right wrong there s so few players in that low mmr low bronze for new players that the queue times for those matches would be astronomical so what did the dev s do they fill those low ranked matches with bots ez mode bots in ranked matches however they give the bots random names like taitai2000 and other randomness so you think you re playing against other players and giving you the feel like the mmr system is working it gives you the illusion that you ll be able to work your way up the brackets and gradually face stronger players as your own skills improve its a farce from bronze v to bronze ii it s nothing but bots with the occasional other na player in the same boat as you there s even a badly translated tooltip on one of the screens that reads something along the lines of robotic players decrease as you ascend through each stage the whole thing is designed to catch you and make you think you re successful then we get into bronze ii i and silver tiers and above this is where you encounter the carries chinese players back again in full force tanking their own mmr or queuing with brand new accounts that sit afk in party so it drags their main account down into your mmr so they can fight you for the ez wins so what does this all mean the game is still not region locked you still fight players from china and all over the world and fight their internet connections their lag and their no life status on the game instead of region locking the game like many na players have called for the dev s create this fake mmr system a system designed to pull the wool over your eyes and make you believe you re actually achieving something in reality all you re doing is being prepared as fodder for far eastern players who are either too bad or too bored of playing against each other that they want to ruin your gaming experience instead
