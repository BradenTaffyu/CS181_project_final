unfortunately safer seas was not the pve mode that i had hoped for it is severely gimped to the point that you get almost no rewards can t use captained ships which are purely cosmetic and must spend an arbitrary amount of extra time delivering your loot compared to pvp players for no proper reason at all i write proper because some of the more vocal forum dwellers will claim it s a case of risk vs reward which is a silly argument when all rewards in this game are purely cosmetic and the two modes are completely separate from each other also have a look at the forums and see how many of the posts are locked personally i haven t posted anything there but i find it problematic that a certain moderator named mopwielder is unable to act as a mature adult and allow open and even positive discussions regarding pve yes there have been several threads that have been exclusively positive said moderator has clearly let the discussion get to their head and is unable to distance themselves from these discussions without getting emotionally triggered as is also apparent from some of their replies talking about agendas and other conspiracies at least it s a mixture of both sad and entertaining to watch i guess
