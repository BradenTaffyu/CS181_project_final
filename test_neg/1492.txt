2022 to preface i put 2 000 hours into warhammer 2 it really is my favorite game on pc and feels like a complete package even before you factor in the frankly ludicrous amount of dlc that creative assembly hurls at the consumer in the early days of tww2 s life cycle it was a little shaky and buggy but those problems got ironed out within the first year of the game s release we are almost one full year into tww3 s launch and it has been turbulent at best and a nightmare at worst i m not going to discuss realms of chaos because everyone else here already has but in short its very bad instead i m going to talk about immortal empires and for how the player is essentially punished for playing the game the way it is intended to be played one of the things about total war is that usually throughout a campaign you create an empire you build wide not tall save for a few specific factions like wood elves or now warriors of chaos in order to build wide you need to capture settlements in order to capture settlements you need to engage in settlement battles which are by in large the worst addition to the franchise the cobbled together mess that is siege mechanics in this game make for an unenjoyable experience for both attacking and defending attacking because you are forced to take attritional damage from the computer level micro management throughout the entire fight no matter how superior a force you have due to ever present siege towers that you as a player couldn t possibly afford to have at that point in a battle as defender you have to wait until you have enough supplies before you yourself can build those same siege towers to defend while the ai barrels towards you at a speed that you can t possibly hold out until they arrive both sides attacking and defending are forced to deal with the abysmal pathing of your units that will charge 120 entity units into a single file line right into units that are braced and pick them off one by one despite you giving an order to not go anywhere but a straight line in tww2 the settlement battles that defaulted to open field battles were prime and if they really wanted to incorporate some form of buildings into their siege battles they could literally take inspiration from older total war games such as attila or rome where defending and attacking settlements was both fun and felt rewarding actual proper city sieges are slightly less annoying because they re walled cities it makes sense for the city to be fortified and have defenses put in place but the battles suffer many of the same problems that settlement sieges do in that pathing is horrible attacking is an attrition contest and defending is just giving away parts of your city in order to bank enough supply points to build a hot zone inside the city it makes zero logical sense that the optimal defense strategy is to completely abandon your walls as you will never win on them diplomacy has been improved greatly in this game giving you the ability to threaten factions despite this rarely working to gain treaties or payments and more notably the abilities to not only trade territory finally and the ability to have meaningful alliances with the use of the military coordination mechanic that being said confederation is now almost obsolete as an option factions even if you control several provinces have the largest standing military and have thrown gold at joined wars with or even been allied to or traded with your suitable confederation targets will refuse to join your faction this is especially annoying for when you are trying to confederate factions that contain legendary lords you may want during your campaign i admit it was too easy in tww2 with you just being able to shower your kin in gold in order to submit their autonomy but in 3 they will only join you if they are on their last settlement that is currently under siege with no standing military force to resist their enemies the endgame scenarios for tww3 are an interesting concept on paper but in practice are just what flavor of armies do you want to fight for the remainder of your campaign most of the endgame scenarios just spawn limitless amounts of armies of whatever faction gets picked until you destroy all the related factions major factions i e destroy all major vampire counts factions for their scenario all major dwarf factions for their s etc i also wish there was still a mass chaos invasion option as the chaos invasion in tww1 and tww2 was really fun especially with tww2 s method of being able to crank the difficulty of the invasion itself it really could become a massive doomsday event where chaos engulfs the world but the scenarios in tww3 just do not fill the same niche even though i rated the game as a negative review i do like the game quite a bit but in its current state it is just not where it needs to be in order for the game to be considered complete we are almost a full year into the game s life and only just recently did we even receive immortal empires a feat that the second game achieved in a month
