this game looked really cool and honestly the gameplay is really fun but dont buy this i regret it already you have to spend so much money to play anything you like the base game basically only lets you play chaos and for everything else you need to buy the stupid expensive dlc s or get this buy warhammer 1 and 2 yes you have to buy two other games to play the most iconnic factions empire greenskins dwarfs elfs you name it it is redicilous that they dare ask 60 euro s for this game just for you to get that little in the way of factions realistically you will spending well over a 120 euro s to get all the stuff you like its getting to the point of paradox greed here seriously companies like these can go themselfs cause they ruin otherwise perfectly good games like these these greedy developers and publishers
