2016 not recommended to buy right now due to many exploits and cheating rampant in the game 1 anyone can disconnect right before being sacraficed to avoid losing rank and denying rank of the killer with no penalty edit all developers did for this issue was shuffle the problem to the survivors so now a killer can dc and the survivors will not gain ranks basically developers are kneejerk nerfing survivors into the ground and giving killers free points for doing nothing2 infinite window and pallet exploits can cause games to go on for hours untill the killer decides to dc edit more survivor nerfs game is more unfun than ever good luck winning as anything but killer3 rank 1 cheaters who only climbed the ranks by d c and never being punished for their loses edit still rank 1s who have not been punished for their ranks after the patch4 toxic community spawned by above reasons players have no consideration for others and will disconnect their game at the slightest sign of losing their pip5 win trading and boosting becoming rampant due to easily exploited point system6 did i mention bugs stuck in walls stuck on rocks stuck on corners stuck on everything making you a nice sitting duck for killerdont buy untill they patch all of these issues out of the game playing the game with these issues will only bring frustration and dissapointmentedit issues still stand therefore the review will stay as is all the developers have done is shuffle around the problems and add bandaid fixes now when a survivor disconnects the killer gets free points without even trying so a new issue has poped up where killers will intentionally cause their system to lag so survivors will go offline or get downed do to a lag teleporting killer and there is nothing you can do but dc giving the killer basically handicap pity points for being a scumbag they also do not give survivors the same treatment when a killer gets salty for losing and ends the lobby right before survivors escape effictively ending the entire game on the spot and awarding survivors with zero escape points and no rankingso all the developers did was heavily nerf survivors and give killers handicap points for laging and ragequiting fixing nothing negative review stands untill issues are truely fixed not bandaided
