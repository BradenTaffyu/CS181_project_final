2021 the online game would be fun to play if rockstar wasn t so lazy to do something about all the hackers modders in the servers the missions are really enjoyable i really love moddefying the cars in the game and driving around in the open world if it weren t for all the cheaters ingame the single play aspect is really good love the story and how the characters are made so if you wanna buy this game for the story go ahead it s good online not so much and still i keep comming back to online play what a waste
