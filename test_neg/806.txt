2023 the fact they just removed cs go and also the fact that many features from cs go are gone missing made me not recommend it no more shorter 15 rounds competitive mode no more arms race mode and all associated war games modes no more team deathmatch there is only free for all deathmatch many maps from cs go missing default players models associated with maps themes are now missing every maps are now just using the gas mask ct and balaclava terrorists any garry s mod addons that was using cs go assets are now broken all custom maps made for cs go are not compatible with cs2 countless community maps are lost so yeah this release feel really rushed and removing cs go was a very bad decision
