2020 yeah no this game is full of cheaters i regret buying it in the past only to find out it became such a sausage fest entire communities of cheaters people posting videos on x platform showcasing gameplay with cheats account trading this is a thing now to have skins while cheating because nobody cheats with skins overwatch sucks as apparently big game cheaters avoid it easily i don t know man maybe i m too frustrated over cheaters but this is the truth many of your games will feature at least one so good luck winning while having your fun ruined oh and one more thing don t think you can just kick the cheater if they are on your team and restore the fun this ain t happening since most of them are partied up with at least one of your teammates and to all the people who work on cheats for games like this one and sell them i know this is your work and maybe you need the money but sincerely f k you with the knowledge you have you could do honest work to earn your living not feed off a toxic community of people who can t use their mouse to aim and prefer ruining other people s fun out of rage and or boredom i m throwing this game in the garbage can until it hopefully gets better
