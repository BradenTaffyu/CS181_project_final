2021 after they broke the fov for pc i cant play this game anymore due to motion sickness after spending lots of real money on their emporium too so disappointed this sums it up pretty well let s be real for a second why do people use high fov because low fov makes them motion sick that is a fact and even with fov cranked up all the way to the maximum with a config edit i do get motion sick during storms due to excessive ship shaking and lower fovs only worsen the situation high fov is a legitimate accessibility feature they just removed this alone renders the game nigh unplayable for me and many other players because we literally cannot play it due to us getting motion sick in a matter minutes hours all depends on a person for boasting high amount of accessibility features some of which are legitimately great developers forgot about a fairly common and long known issue among players some of them get motion sick and cannot play at low fovs due to that now let s talk about unfair advantage to which i want to say what advantage exactly high fov is advantageous for peripheral vision but it drastically reduces your ability to see in the distance as all objects get way smaller but sot gameplay is primarily based on distance who spots the ship in the horizon first person to whom said ship is visibly larger or one who can see a bit more to the sides but everything in the distance is smaller obviously the first one and on practice i ve experienced it numerous times as i struggle to find that tiny sail in the distance god help me to figure out if they have an emissary on top of that not to mention that i have harder time reading tall tales as they are almost 2x smaller and not being able to use some tricks like looking down to the map from upper floor trough the openings it s too small but sure i can see to the sides a bit more how did that help me in gameplay not a lot because melee fights are not that prevalent and skeletons don t pose much of a threat regardless of fov in conclusion fov does not provide players unfair advantage if anything it have a slew of disadvantages specific to sot fov is not just see more on the sides it s a trade off between being able to see in a more wide angle at exchange of being able to see in a distance now to tos if you look at where the configuration files are stored they are located in the userspace not in the game folder meaning that editing those are within the user discretion and is not editing static game files it s not the same as patching game archives to change textures and such developers still can claim it s part of game files but those same files are created by the game on first startup as well as edited by it when user configured the game while config did exploit a configuration section that was not exposed in the ui it is still just a configuration of the game not a hack or a cheat which are bannable people are pissed about this fix not because it gives advantage they are pissed because it made the game a lot worse for them as they are no longer can play it comfortably without getting motion sick
