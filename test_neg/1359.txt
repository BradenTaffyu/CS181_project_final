2022 the short i didn t really think what everyone was clamoring for was the ubisoft ification of dark souls the long pros jump button music horse combat mostly fun addictive cons shockingly laggy movement is jank the world seems very empty stamina consumption feels random graphics are often ugly and washed out ditches many of the better systems from previous games walked back some of the better ideas from the network tests flailing you need the wiki where did my legs go why did my monitor stop working it crashed again mostly it s dark souls 3 but bigger and with extra tat tacked on and yet somehow the whole thing feels a bit cheap it s a big mostly empty open world with dodgy traversal mechanics the few hours i played were mostly hiding in bushes collecting flowers the new sneaking around can be fun in an assassins creed way but in the one camp i found enemies tend to be in line of site of one another and the backstab is slow enough to leave you open from what little i saw you can t really build a character around stealth before too long i found a gatehouse where the archer can spot you through cover and bosses boss adjacent monsters really won t let you get away with it like in the aforementioned ubisoft sandboxes really the game is done no favors comparing it to assassins creed as it s often a very ugly game assets pop in creatures disappear and all the colors feel very washed out that s not uncommon for from software games but from the character creation screen it looked like a marked improvement over ds3 sadly in game models are low rez with larger ones having hard corners that show the limited poly count many assets seem to be copy pasted giving the whole experience a very cheap feel not helped by the fact that the prolog is a slideshow makes me wonder what could be causing all the lag i don t mind dyeing in a souls game but when lag keeps killing me i m gonna be a bit cross it s very odd too i have a pretty high end pc and can run much much better looking games on ultra without issue the early on supposed to loose fight bugged out so badly that the thing faded to black before i took any damage it stayed that way long enough that i thought it had crashed until i saw the loading symbol for an uncomfortably long time that alone would be an issue worth waiting for a patch to buy but the controls are janky too there didn t seem to be analog sensitivity adjustment so had to keep switching out controllers until i found one that didn t interrupt me walking across the room in a straight line how could this have happened they nailed this before yeah so the elephant in the room here is sekiro not just sekiro but we ll get to that traversal stealth and combat improvements miles above any of the souls games were all there but they ditched them for some reason i m not saying we needed a grappling hook but why make the jumps so awkward and imprecise all the low ledges and walls seem to encourages jumping but it s very unclear as to what can be vaulted over like sekiro it does embrace the idea that movement doesn t consume stamina sort of it does when you re in combat though that can be somewhat academic due to the poor stealth system and other factors i couldn t place sekiro also nailed parrying blocking and dodging and by that i mean they were balanced enough so that they were all useful the perilous attacks system was a spectacular way to engage foes unlike most soulsborn games you really had to parry yet for some reason we are for the most part back to dark souls 3 style block dodge and parries so inexact your better off not bothering reviews keep saying it s a culmination of all from software has learned but it s seems more like a pick n mix of middling ideas even if you didn t want to pull from sekiro for the combat why ignore the other games the only presence from dark souls 2 seems to be the double weapons nice to have but hardly that game s best feature they seem to keep doing this dark souls was great for it s time but dark souls 2 and bloodborn greatly refined the formula yet dark souls 3 seems to have contained none of what made those games better and here again here as in ds3 we are awash in samey weapons i though bb taught you a dozen well designed weapons are better then way way too many swords parrying especially needed to look to these three titles ds2 made nigh everything parryable and gave you a big window to counter bb made parrying at range possible and sekiro made it fluid enough that it was always a strong option here we re back to ds3 s parrying is here but blocking or dodging is still more viable in truth this game is proof to me they failed to learn from themselves but they re not even looking to what their peers have done during the network tests leveling strength gave you the ability to wear heavier armor as in the nioh games which let mutable stats dictate this but they switch it back to only endurance granting more carry weight why it makes more sense for the strength based character to have heavier armor strength scaling weapons often have slower windups and longer punishes as a result you may have to soak a hit to land a blow it was a good idea it had been proven to work in other souls like games and they cut it out on that note where s the rallying system got to that was such a great feature i ve seen it crop up in many other games is it hidden somewhere in this overstuffed mess i could go on i played this game for about five hours and while it felt longer than that i don t think i really got anywhere in point of fact i think i ve already gone on too long but it s all kind of moot as my primary issue is that it s just kinda boring i mean haven t we been here before i ve never started a new from software game and within hour i m reaching for a podcast i want more sekiro more bloodborn heck i d even take more dark souls 2 but just don t want whatever this is update after many hours i did get into it the horse combat helped as it is largely very fun but everything comes with a caveat the mounted sections are good until you get arbitrarily knocked off your alpaca now that is admittedly annoying but what s worse is there s nothing you can do about it there s no barding you can equip on your beast and while the game says putting points into dexterity helps keep you from falling off i m at 60 dex and i don t see much difference also it would only sort of mater if there was a huge difference as you can t as far as i can tell actively do anything to increases your fluffy friends hp getting knocked off your horse is often instant death as you just lie on the ground for an age waiting to be mauled it s not unlike you ve had the controller torn from your hand and it is held out of reach until you are ether killed or are obscenely low on health and just to put a cherry on the alpaca manure sunday when your fine beasty does inevitably die you have to use a health potion to revive them by way of a menu prompt asking are you sure you want to bring your only chance of survival back from the dead at the megger cost of one of your many easily replenished items yeah i m pretty forking sure elden ring except don t bother because i died battling with your superfluous text box again keeping with caveats the bosses are often quite fun despite their copy paste nature but some just won t let up i d say learn their pattern but that only maters if they ever take a break dark souls 2 got critisised for having too many foes per encounter but i ll take that over half of them having a hyper combo by far your best option is to find your favorite utterly broken spell consumable ash of war etc there s no shortage and use it as a crutch when the game decides to change the ru
