2022 regretting the purchase should have bought it in some months today 2 months after release they released 1 1 patch fixing many many issues many including technical ones still left to be fixed and its the 3rd entry of the saga so they should have learned now basic content expected to release not later than 1 month after games launch like the blood and gore pack something basic for many that is not shipped with core game due to ratings is postponed until who knows when the excuse the bad state of the game which justifies months and months of fixing until the game has a decent low amount of bugs and some decent optimization regarding performance for many of us who like to enjoy zoomed in battles the lack of blood gore and killing animations etc breaks the deal i played it for 50h expected the content to release like in total warhammer 1 and 2 1 month after release and nothing happened now its a broken toy the player count is below minimum the forums is full of people like me saying regretting the day 1 purchase now back to the waiting game its an aaa studio that has profits spilling from their ears but join the bandwagon of releasing ultra broken games and patching them in the coming months this is not even an mmo not even a live service game but looks like 2 months after release we are very dependant on the developers as many many more bugfixing and performance patches are needed
