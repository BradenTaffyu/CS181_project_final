2018 do not buy starter edition although i d ultimately reccomend this game for it s brilliant yeam based gameplay i have several grievances with the starter edition starter edition is a godforsaken travesty that personally ruined an otherwise great game not only was its initial advertisment misleading but usbisoft continue to leave starter edition players in the dust compared to players of more expensive versions of the game for starters the most aggregious issue would have to be the astronomical price of operators in starter mode the player is only treated to two now apparently four although old players have yet to be reimbursed operators upon starting the game and each subsequent operator will cost them 12500 renown each dlc operator is double that price depending on your skill level that averages out to about 30 60 hours of playtime per operator you wish to unlock not considering the money spent on cosmetic items or attatchements the most fustrating thing about this situaion is there is no option to upgrade back to normal edition i can t pay the difference i saved upon my intial purchase my only option would be to buy a whole new copy of the game which would leave me being shafted in the end recently the entirety of the intial operators went free for everyone well everyone apart from those playing on starter edition who have had no reard for their purgatory for me this was the final nail in the coffin it was ubisoft demonstrating that they couldn t care less about the enjoyment level of their customers only caring about squeezing every last penny out of them rainbow six siege is no longer a game in my eyes but rather an exercise in corporate greed ubisoft can inhale my richard also the addition of new operators is always handled poorly they all boil down to either op gimmick that gets nerfed come next update or a straight upgrade of a previous operator e g thermite ash hibana mid season reinforcements have also been cancelled which is stupid imo
