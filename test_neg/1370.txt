2023 i wish there was less open world stuff and more stuff like stormveil castle the open world and the terrible optional dungeons don t feel as though they have the same care put into them that larger legacy dungeons do for such a large game it seems to have the same amount of content in it as dark souls 3 just spread out a lot further hopefully more updates and dlcs come that round the game out and make things feel more complete i can t really recommend it until that point
