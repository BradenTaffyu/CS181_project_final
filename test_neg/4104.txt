a huge selling point for the steamdeck was that it can run gtav perfectly and i was able to play online with friends on invite only session without cheaters and or modders now i cannot do that because off battle eye great job r the solution would be really easy enable proton support to battle eye so i hope you do that quickly so i can change this negative review to a positive one
