i m left handed and need to rebind a lot of keys seems some keys it just wont let you rebind to a particular keyboard key but other keys it will and things you use all the time like the f key to open stuff etc i need to rebind this but seems currently no way to do same this is critical for gaming for a left handed gamer so makes it frustrating to play and not even got out the main building and having these basic fundamental issues all keys should be able to be rebound also want switch between first and third person as well that doesn t seem possible either guess this is what you get with a free to play so for me not recommending it in 2024 these basic key bind issues should not exist edit my workaround i have a razor mouse with extra buttons one can bind to anything so i bound the f key to one of them and i can now play the game and enjoying it yea i spent quite a bit on same yrs back not everyone can afford that edit they have fixed some of the issues re key binds but some still remain i ll change my review once they fix the remaining key bind problems my negative rating stands until they fix this
