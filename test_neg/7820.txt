2023 i played this game a lot with friends a few years ago via game pass but we gave up because of all the sweats who s only goals were to chase you down and kill your fun we were not interested in pvp then and are not now additionally i wanted to play with my young kids but there was zero chance i was going to expose them to the toxic players in the pvp world of this game i am thrilled that rare finally realized there are more players interested in pve and created safer seas for this group of players but to handicap the safer seas so much and call it a tutorial before you play the real game of high seas is silly and pointless pve focused players will never go back to high seas period and its very clear based on the high server demand caused by pve players that they are the future of the game so while i do like the game and i want to play with friends and family it s already clear that the grind that will be required in the nerfed safer seas to earn gold will limit to long term play value so at this time i can t recommend this game to others that are looking for pve if you want pvp then go for it rare i truly hope you will take the limitations away from safer seas there is no good reason not to allow both player types to enjoy your game to its fullest i know there are a lot of other pve players just like me who want to enjoy the full game but just don t want to deal with the toxic a holes in pvp please consider removing the restrictions
