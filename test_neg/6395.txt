2020 i have been playing dead by daylight casually for almost four years i enjoyed the game immensely over that time even during the so called dark times the premise is sound the gameplay was at one point solid but the game has devolved and i can no longer support the developers for the following reasons 1 the developers are slow to act bugs stay in the game for months or years after being widely acknowledge currently there is an add on bug that affects the nurse killer that if even accidentally used can cause the player to be permanently banned from the game instead of removing the add on from play in a hotfix the developers have chosen to do nothing this is one example 2 the developers don t listen to the community if the community praises the developers or reinforces their chose path then the developers will acknowledge the praise and interact with those players if the community is critical of certain design decisions they are either told this is what we re doing or they re ignored outright no justification is given for certain decisions and some decisions are met with the reason because this is what we re doing 3 the community is incredibly toxic it isn t to rust levels of toxic chat logs can be submitted via reports after all however as the state of the game become more and more unstable the community is turning more against one another while the developers remain apathetic 4 survivor gameplay is stagnant for survivors the gameplay consists of either holding w or holding m1 despite what you may have seen from streamers or content creators the majority of games are an exercise in tedium 5 killer gamplay is frustrating without a proper fix for the underlying issues plaguing matches killers either spend matches mitigating the effects of survivors second chance abilities negating a killer s efforts completely or they completely dominate within minutes the back and forth that used to exist in the game no longer does to any satisfactory conclusion 6 there are alternatives last year exists resident evil resistance will soon be available with more options in the asymmetrical horror genre dead by daylight as bugged and imbalanced as it currently stands is primed to quickly lose its player base and die out in summary i cannot recommend this game the developers do not work for the community and often dismiss feedback it has seen its best years and it s on the decline there are other better options on the horizon and beginning to play now is a wasted investment of time and money
