2023 first i ll say that the game can be fun with friends but it s all very short lived due to other people who literally only play this game to steal your treasure and ruin your experience trying to get a rise out of you i have never seen a community with so many toxic players who will go out of their way and spend literally hours of their time trolling people trying to make people angry so they can make a video about it and laugh at them and this behaviour is considered normal in this community very popular streamers make a living off of trolling people the get good suck it nerd stay mad kind of crowd is strong here it s a pirate game is the common excuse used as a license to be an a hole so unless you fit in with these people or otherwise have a thick skin and can deal with people slinging racial slurs and crapping on your game play literally every time you log in i d avoid this one edit skill issue is the common thing that the toxic people in the game say when someone gives a poor review of the game it s not a skill issue you re a jerk is the issue i had to learn how to fight because of jerks and now could probably double gun 420 fidget spin on your face then bucket your dust as you fling racial slurs at me in game clowns guess what i still gave this game a negative review because the community is toxic af period
