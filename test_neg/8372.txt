2022 it took too long to start to enjoy the game i cannot recommend it as is because the learning curve is too steep too many game mechanics are hidden or not well explained you should not have to google so much just to figure out what s happening that said i am now having fun with it but i had to basically study a book first a few suggestions explain spell interactions in game i e chainsaw removes cast delay modifiers apply to all spells in a spell group regardless of where they are placed wands loop around the end with multicasts or modifiers etc the noita wiki page has a lot of information and much of it should be on tooltips in game always show what spells you just cast like the wall in the holy mountain perhaps at the bottom of screen but have a few lines so you can see the instantaneous single chainsaw that is tough to land on and wouldn t know was there otherwise more room to store spells and items beginners don t know what to save or discard after 100 hours of play time it might be no problem since you would know what synergizes but i think it would be a lot more fun for beginners to experiment with more storage room more gradual difficulty scaling the final 1 of the game is way more interesting because you can finally experiment with cool spells until you know all the ways you can die you spend 99 of the time with next to no perks and spells tinker with wands everywhere always beginners need to be able to experiment with a variety of spells and will rarely get this absolutely essential perk pause time when the inventory is open it takes long enough to finally acquire something fun to experiment with dying while editing wands is a bit harsh introduce a softcore mode with save points so that beginners can get a taste for the full range of the game in less than 100 hours add an in game map have a fog of war if you want so that mid game players don t have to constantly reference a website
