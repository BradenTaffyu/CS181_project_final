do not play this game look at my hours into this piece of garbage i don t believe that there would be many more qualified than me to speak about the current state of the game people say stop crying it s free to play i ll start by saying that i ve spent well over 130 on this game in the first few weeks and in that time i really enjoyed it heck i have the hours to back it up i ve remodeled my base more times than i can count did runs with friends and enjoyed what could be done in the game wherever i could but this game does not respect your time effort and overall experience picture this you spend hundreds and i mean hundreds of hours min maxing gear gathering resources haggling with players grinding nonstop doing tens of hours of calculations on equipment stats and effects to decide which i ll go with farming starchrom premium currency to buy said gears and waste majority trying to make the best build barely having any left afterwards and make the most out of everything you can but this update is just wow not only did they leave the build i painstakingly crafted with hundreds of hours and tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of resources the many sleepless nights farming mods that would make my perfect build and wham one update and it s reduced to less than half of what it used to be no compensation no heads up nothing just a straight up f u from the dev team deciding that you don t deserve anything you ve earned and worked hard for and that they can take it away any time they want and here s the best part one of the main issues the reload speed cap being called an issue when in their game are tons of builds from armors and calibration blueprints explicitly state a ton of stats pertaining to reload speed that are so jacked in numbers that you re basically asking for instant reloads if you choose to build them all 150 reload speed from shotgun calibs a purple mask that basically stacks reload speed for you to up to 250 more reload speed and i dont mean 250 x base reload it s 250 on top of the base reload so like 350 and they call the cap a fix on an issue they just turned off their brains decided to put a cap call it an issue and say nothing else all while expecting players that worked hard to build all these to get screwed over and shut up you know it would ve been fine if the game lets you farm materials and just craft other builds but no starchrom is limited each season and the mere fact that they have upgradable blueprints means they expect you to stick with your builds and hopefully enhance them as the seasons progress but what about getting the best build of the season and having it nerfed to oblivion just because they wanted to i basically turned into a clown pouring hundreds of hours into this just to become subpar and a joke thank you devs for making me realize that even if you fix this i am not trusting you at all 0 to not repeat this joke of an event if you re so easily able to screw over your playerbase and treat their time and effort as sh t what else are not willing to do how can we believe anything they say heck at this rate they could just monetize boosts and make it pay to win at any time they choose since they don t care about the players at all anyways why won t they do it they can screw over players at this scale what s stopping them from doing that an important thing to keep in mind the tests are done already this is no beta early access it s a full game no playing the ohh we re still early access card and this isn t the first time they nerfed players mid season we stayed quiet the first few nerfs because we could still manage to overcome them and they weren t too massively oppressive to the point that your whole experience in the whole season might as well have never happened just don t do it save yourself the time and money and don t play this game
