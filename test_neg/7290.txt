honestly this game is a big let down from the first one the story isnt as good the exploration is completely unrewarding the combat is improved upon so thats one plus the end game is nonexistent in this one this is well worth a play if you ve never played the first game but if you have played dd 1 this game will let you down and if you ve played ddda this game is a step backwards just with prettier graphics
