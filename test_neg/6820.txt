i was playing a with randoms on zombies long story short one of them was hacking and set my level to 1 and kicked me from the game whenever i try to boot it up it just crashes every time i just uninstalled and reinstalled and still isnt working doesnt seem to be a fix unfortunatley makes the game unplayable bc someone with a ego made of glass has a mod menu to abuse zero stars cant even refund
