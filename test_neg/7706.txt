2023 honestly the best pirate game out there beautiful visuals relaxing atmosphere scenery extremly fun gameplay loop too bad it s forced pvp without the option to play in some form of offline mode while i agree that a pirate game needs ship battles jolly social interactions with your fellow crew or random strangers and awesome fights for loot you just uncovered on a remote island i pretty much hate the sweaty pvp aspects npc enemies would just do fine there are enemy npc ships and hostile foes in the open world that aren t real people sweating to kill you over and over again these npcs are a fun challange and there is a vast variety of them sailing the ocean imagine you just finished a voyage that took you and your pal more than an hour to complete you just wanna sell all your stuff at an outpost to get those juicy coins to get more fashionable clothing and ship customisations just for a random ship that just joined the world a few minutes ago to hunt you down slaughter your whole crew and sell your hard earned valuables the sweaty pvp aspects are also a reason why i refuse recommending this game especially to older folks that are 40 due to the game being extremly hostile towards new players there isn t an easy mode where you get matched with new players like yourself you ll get thrown into the same game the 4000 hour tryhard is currently playing on it isn t fun enjoyable nor relaxing it s just frustrating but you do you if you are looking for this kinda pvp in a game you little masochist
