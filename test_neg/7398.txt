so i am going to have to give the game a negative review and it is entirely based on the save system it is the most backwards junk system i have seen in a decade you get two save the constantly auto updating main save and the inn save the inn save can only be done as inns so of course in this massively huge open world map their are inns all over the place right no you have camp site all over the place so you can get an inn save there right no so in the few inns there are i can just go up and click save no it costs you gold and automatically puts you into a rest cycle weather you like it or not to create back up points you will literally need to go to the save file location on your computer and copy the save file and save a copy some where else on your computer the inconvenience of this system negates any positives about the game because a wrong button press or the game crashing at the wrong time can cost you hours of game play i can t fathom what the game designers though that this type of system would add to game play edit so found out why they have this screwed up save system and the reason is even more messed up then if the game designers were just idiots it is a spoiler but i strongly suggest that everyone playing this game looks up the in game effect of what the dragon plague is this feature that can soft lock your game advancement is just about the dumbest thing i have heard as a game design if you want to find out what this little gem of a poison pill idea the dragon plague is on your own that s fine just remember that the save system is designed to screw you hard
