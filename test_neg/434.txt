despite counter strike having a prestigious storied history as a competitive multiplayer game the current crowd community difficulty level means that the game is not entirely welcoming to players who aren t optimised towards taking a pre aimed headshot kills mostly 95 of the time this can lead to a very frustrating experience this is made worse with lack of map knowledge requiring a lot of trial error without guidance till you successfully figure out higher success rate pixel peeks and seemingly repeat the same scenario again again it s nice to play with friends but the unforgiving nature of the game means you re probably better playing deathmatch mode than even casual mode any frustrating map elements maps aren t like the cs 1 6 or source days that much more experienced players know how to utilise will only compound any pre existing frustrations
