2021 this game substitutes rng for actual difficulty this game wouldn t be so brutal if so many aspects of it were not reliant upon rng giving you a less than optimal chance there are so many situations in this game where just happenstance and luck leave you in a position where you cannot come out on top this is not good game design mistakes should be punished not falling into some situation that i was placed in because of rng and i haven t been given the tools to escape here s two examples i was having an amazing run i had a wand with chain lightning and a couple of augments to it to make it absolutely amazing i was sitting really pretty i spawn in on the third level i fall down the shaft and find there is only one direction to move in and it is absolutely full i mean probably 6 or 7 enemies including the gunner mama ones that spawn more and i was pigeon holed and had to fight them through 1 very small opening there was absolutely no escape but up and that was still a dead end so i could see myself coming out of that on the other side technically surviving but the next example was just absolutely unreasonable i also had a good run where i had a good spell and augments on a wand i got hit by the first shot of one of the enemies that when they hit you teleport you i was teleported right above the portal to the next level and then when i spawned in immediately teleported out of the spawn area leaving me without the hp spell refill and the opportunity to pick my perk or new wands or spells and teleported directly into a large open space full of enemies i was not prepared to fight rng just absolutely blasted me into the single worst possible situation to be in and i suppose technically this was my fault but being hit a single time by a single enemy shouldn t end a run who do people think that just substituting rng and unreasonable circumstances is just substitution for well thought out game design if you re going to procedurally generate a game you need to put in fail safes to make sure that whatever is generated doesn t insta gib me
