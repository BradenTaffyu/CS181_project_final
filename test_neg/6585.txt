its like destiny and warframe put in a blender but the devs didnt put in the right ingredients the gunplay and character abilities are fun the boss battles are fun but everything else in the game is just not respectful of your time maybe later down the line it will have some better qol changes to make it better but as of now its just not worth investing time i stopped enjoying it around the 35 hour mark but trying to 100 the achievements has me almost at 70 5 10
