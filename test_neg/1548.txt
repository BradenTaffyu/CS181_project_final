2022 update review since 3 0still a no i honestly can say i have not had as much fun with 3 than i did with 2 and thats why i would still pass on this titlehow the campaign works and why it sucksfactions you have no interaction with will declare war on you 50 50 chance that enemy army will show up to attack a settlement while you are engaged with the wars waging with your close up enemies your settlement protection is a mix bag of the worst units in your faction and 1 or 2 good decent the only way these settlements have a chance to win some engagements is a settlement map battle which by far is the least fun fights in the gamecampaigns become tedious you push into an enemy another enemy comes behind you the only way to have side armies is basically just spamming t1 cheap units in wh2 you could usually field 1 good army and a second or third with a single settlement depending on faction tw3 its basically just a revolving door of trash armies plan on loosing them a lot enemy attacks come at specific times for real i have had dozens of enemies declare war on me and do nothing dozens of turns they just sit around but the second i move my armies out to attack boom they move there is no decent way to defend yourself i have not won a single domination victory for any faction save khorne and taurox the brass bull you cannot capture hundreds of settlements without a steam rolling faction which is why it becomes so tedious to play not fun tedious thats total warhammer 3 tedious throw in the bad movement for models the poor model collisions with single entities the ridiculous power of ranged units yes its even worse in 3 they have made the good units uncanny and the bad units dumpster fires for almost every faction magic is even more lopsided battles are tedious chasing down lords that just saunter off every chance they get your units stop attacking while in melee combat the whole thing is tedious just tedious play this with mods its the only way to enjoy it
