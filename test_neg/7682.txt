2021 my thoughts after 700 hours of hoping to see improvements not cpt jack sparrow btw the review isn t about whether it was worth my money but for other people to contemplate whether it s worth theirs you should be so lucky that someone would dedicate the time to experience a game thoroughly and then write about it tl dr following a fairly harsh review i would still recommend to players looking for a few weeks worth of fun with friends you might even enjoy it for longer don t expect a long lasting experience even considering my hours played sea of thieves is entirely session based meaning quest progression and resources you gathered won t follow you into your next session aside from a couple dozen tall tales story driven quests with checkpoints and it s the reason this game will likely never get any in depth content every quest or world event has to be designed to fit within a reasonable period of time otherwise playing 1 2 hour sessions would be a waste this means much of the game s content is rather shallow and inevitably repetitive think generic fetching and kill x amount of mobs type of quests these are pretty much the only quests you get in sea of thieves the boss fights are all damage sponges the quests are simple and repetitive and you spend half your time sailing from a to b with nothing to do but keep the steering wheel straight ultimately everything you do feels like an unengaging grind despite being designed for somewhat brief gameplay sessions and what does this all serve you earn gold and you unlock commendations gold that you can only spend on cosmetics with commendations sometimes unlocking more cosmetics to purchase nothing you can do will alter your gameplay in any meaningful way which is intended to balance a game where pvp is always present and unconstrained and largely arbitrary players will try to sink you with hardly any motive you spend your time working towards whatever cosmetics you think looks nice only to find that the best ones are likely available exclusively in the in game store completely undermining the core incentive to even play the game in the first place to further emphasize sea of thieves follows the games as a service gaas model which typically would mean financing the game in the long term with cosmetics exclusive items boosters monthly subscriptions dlc expansions etc but sea of thieves has none of those things mostly because it can t aside from cosmetics which again are undermined by also being the only form of progression in the game this issue stems from the developers not creating any disincentives for pvp or giving players the tools to dissuade disengage bargain or anything it s so often kill or flee on sight where are the player interactions that this game s entire premise is built upon if you could unlock new gear level up or upgrade your ship newer players would never be able to compete with veterans because you cannot escape pvp however much you try and no pve only servers would just kill the game sea of thieves just isn t designed to be your main primary game that you can play for years despite adopting the gaas model fortunately there s many things the developers could do to fix that i just don t know if they have the budget resources for it though a pirates of the caribbean crossover is not one of those things for new players the game provides a fun and novel experience especially with friends for like a couple of weeks once the veneer of novelty wears off you won t find any longevity or end game content to keep you interested so keep that in mind
