writing this review feels almost as disappointing as playing this game one might think that capcom learned from the flaws of the first game solving them while improving on the strengths right no quite the opposite enemy variety instead of fighting the same 6 monsters types like in the first game you fight the same 3 tedious travelling instead of fighting the same monsters every 50 seconds you fight them every 20 seconds romance system basically the same only made more pointless story they are even reusing the exact same story with the same twists the only difference is that using the same twist post dragon does not work again because it s so predictable if you have played the first game bosses there actually are some new bosses added to the game but instead capcom thought it was a good idea to let you fight ogres and cyclopses again for 90 of the time while taking out the best bosses of the first game beholder and hydra classes yes the classes were pretty unbalanced in the first game but instead of balancing them they just butchered all of them by giving you only 3 abilities except for the warrior my recommendation is to stay away and play the prequel with the dlc which is the best part compared to both games after that you can get this on sale and be as disappointed as i am if you crave a game with a combat system as unique as dragon s dogma
