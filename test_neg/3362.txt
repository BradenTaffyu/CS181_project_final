2016 great for single player great story and can fuel hours of fun with the standard game alone mods make this game great though online is near enough an utter grindfest for newer players and the commuinity is utter cancer full of cheaters children and angry pre teens that have invested more time and cash into shark cards than they have into their education as it comes to when a salty russian corrects a british child on his her s spelling the anti cheat is utter garbage false positives everywhere banning innocent players and letting cheaters roam free you d think with all that money they could have hired a better online security team if rockstar listened to their commuinity which they never have done really as they re still rolling in last year s sales report perhaps this game can have another chance with me edit we re in 2020 now nearly 4 years from this review and r still haven t learnt from their mistakes i hope the greed of this company will catch up to them one day in form of liquidation tl drsingle player fantastic alone even better with mods online avoid like the plauge unless you have some sort of sexual fettish for getting shouted at and wasting your money edit i am aware of the fanboys mass disliking this review as well as the same people in question commenting on my profile because apparantly i m not allowed an opinion online because i dislike a segment of a popular video game grow up children edit due to the devs banning single player mods i will no longer support take two in any way or form i am sick of greedy companies trampling on their consumerbase to try and make an extra buck you guys i hope you go into liquidation for treating us like crap edit 9 8 2018 gave it another go nothing much changed for me modders in every lobby kids begging for cash kd warriors everywhere preying on new players would advice getting some friends to play with because this game has taught me that i can t rely public players
