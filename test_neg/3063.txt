2021 all filler no killer gtav is probably the pinnacle of rockstar s game design game design where the smallest details are included just for the sake of it yet the general gameplay is stuck somewhere in the 00 s game design where side content is jammed into the game for no good reason has barely any gameplay no reward and exists purely to waste your time game design where lots of mechanics are introduced and then get no use throughout the game the ultimate sandbox wide as an ocean and deep as a bath in an attempt to be the biggest sandbox game of all time gtav completely disregards the fact that all content should have a place in a game and be as satisying to play as the main course just like gta san andreas its direct inspiration gtav is filled to the brim with activites and sidequests which are as bleak as writing a retrospective review to an aaa game released almost a decade ago have absolutely zero action and or interesting mechanics and have no rewards because in fact this game has no progression whatsoever the thing is san andreas was released back in 2004 when the sandbox genre was still being figured out and the mere concept of sidecontent was novel gtav was unleashed into a world where saints row and many action rpgs exist where sidecontent is often as important as the main campaign and also provides a meaningful reward well of course you don t have to do side content so what about the main storyline it s well bumpy gtav provides an interesting set up for a criminal drama and sometimes delivers but in a truly rockstar fashion with lots of unnecessary clutter along the way it can deliver some truly awesome moments but between those moments you ll be stuck with unnecessary arcs boring dialogue and narrative that can t figure out if it wants to be serious or wacky resulting in jarring mood jumps the whole scenario feels like it was cobbled together from many completely different arcs which especially shows during the final mission since it was the 2010 s of course the game had to provide you with a completely reduntant choice literally do you suddenly want to work for antagonists who screwed you throughout the game or get a good ending the good ending itself is and then they got fed up with all the and killed all the antagonists including those who have no bearing at the story anymore this is especially jarring cause every other gta protagonist had to earn their ending meanwhile v s ending feels like eh i think we wrote enough let s end it here the gameplay side is also hurt by the kitchen sink approach the game does a lot of things at once and none of them are good the shooting is unresponsive the guns feel weak and there s literally zero interesting mechanics tied to guns ammo doesn t matter upgrades don t matter anything dies in a single headshot anyway and vehicles go in a single grenade rocket the cover system is still a sluggish mess it was in iv and combat as a whole feels unimpactful as for the missions themselves they suffer massively from awful pacing the game knows no restraint when it comes to bore you you ll be doing things that would have been a cutscene in literally any other game oh and the game just loves to do 5 10 minute drives with zero action whatsoever the thing is when gtav is great it s truly great it was made with lots of experience a huge budget and sometimes it shows the problem is you ll have to earn your great moments by grinding through literal hours of filler naturally all this needs be taken into account with the sequel right take a smaller and more condensed map gtavice city hype fill it with sidecontent that is actually engaging maybe introduce deeper mechanics so doing said content actually affects your playthrough write a storyline full of action but nah instead gtav was turned into a soulless life service by take two and is gonna be milked till the heat death of the universe the fact that the biggest videogame franchise of all time was turned into a that constantly asks you to buy 100 shark cards shows just how up the current game industry is gtav is a swan song of what used to be one of the definitive videogames whatever gtavi would be it would be a product of corporate greed and a new set of writers that would most likely misunderstand what makes gta s satire work gta as we knew and loved it died and not with a bang but with a long and rather dull whimper although nevermind all that the last line of the story provides a perfectly clear explanation on why gtav the mess it is i m getting too old for this nonsense dan houser ending grand theft auto as we know it forever
