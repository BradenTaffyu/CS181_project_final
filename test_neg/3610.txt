2017 the story mode is amazing the story line characters and and even map is fantastic but the online is a different story rockstar has pretty much ignored every single player and has turned the game into a pay to win the new military vehicles has destroyed my passion for the game not including story mode vehicles are priced way to high and its almost impossible to make money to get these stupid vehicles unless you re a 10 12 year old who got it for christmas it may be fun otherwise dont even bother with this mess of a game it used to be fun until they added new vehicles you rockstar
