tl drthe game is absolutely fantastic and very addicting yet i can t forgive capcom for releasing a 70 usd title with such poor optimization and performance issues on top of the audacity of releasing day 1 pay to win dlc even though you can earn the stuff in game capcom released a statement that they will investigate performance so i ll gladly change my review to positive once they fix it dragon s dogma 2 is the game i ve been waiting for over 10 years i absolutely loved the first and played it for countless hours the sequel expands everything the original title offered pumped to eleven it s really hard to put the controller down once i start playing that said this is a very punishing game you can fail quests npcs can die including quest givers and there is a certain mechanic within the game that can potentially kill all the npcs in a town there is absolutely no hand holding in this title the good this game probably has the best character customization i ve ever seen it s incredibly detailed and there are crazy stuff you can do just check reddit to see all kinds of characters people make combat is meaty and filled with depth it feels like something between monster hunter and dark souls a bit on the sluggish side as you have to commit to your attacks but there are a plenty of animation cancel through skills the whole mechanic of climbing monsters is huge appeal exploration is satisfying and despite the game being open world you ll always stumble on something interesting every so often the pawns will always alert if there are any points of interest and mark them on the map this is arguably one of the best open worlds i ve ever seen there is rarely empty space that plagues so many other open world games you ll always find items to harvest meet a traveling pawn or a merchant or stumble upon a small group of enemies every few steps and the world design is so beautiful and varied it never feels stale you have a lot of freedom to do what you want when you want there are also multiple ways to solve quests the dungeons are incredibly claustrophobic in the best way possible the reliance on using light to navigate dark caverns is something i loved in the original game and it s pumped to eleven here the revised vocations as well the brand new hybrid vocations feel so good to control mystic spearhand is super fun and my favorite so far the power fantasy is much stronger in this game compared to the first one the game has plenty of graphics settings to tweak with nearly non existing loading times surprisingly the bad the story is a mixed bag the first game had a clear defined objective find grigori the dragon and kill him in this one the dragon doesn t even have a name and he doesn t feel impacting to the story in the slightest until the very end they also try to pull some game of thrones vibes with political machinations but it never pays off the whole plot feels incredibly disconnected lots of characters that are featured in the trailer cover and promotional material barely appear in the story there is no build up and there is no pay off things happen at random without explanation it s not some cryptic writing like dark souls just plain bad the camera is a bit janky sometimes especially inside dungeons such as caverns with tight walls while you can increase the field of view it s not enough there are plenty of times where i get hit from stuff offscreen that i have no time to react despite the pawn system being refined the pawn ai still is a bit dumb sometimes they will often approach enemies head on even the likes of mages and sorcerers i ve lost count how many times my pawns killed themselves by standing in front of enemies there is still a lot of platforming in this game but the it doesn t really work very well movement can feel janky and very unprecise while you do have a lot of freedom there are a couple of times where the game doesn t really explain what you need to do the game still uses a couple of outdated mechanics from the first title most notably poor inventory management and vague ability tooltips no gear skill loadout system this was an issue in the original game and it persists here swapping between vocations is still a massive chore there is a lot of backtracking this existed in the original but the world size was like a tenth of the sequel i understand this is part of itsuno s vision and i actually enjoy the traveling but it can get annoying lack of enemy variety that is somehow less than the first game i wish there were more races to choose from you can make humans and cat people but would be pretty cool if there were other races to choose from it s a huge step for the series though the terrible it s really painful to say this but i don t think this game was ready to release yet it s so poorly optimized even though it s loaded with graphics settings my specs are above the minimum requirement but i was getting framerate drops all the time even outside of cities between 20 to 10 fps as well gpu temperatures reaching whopping 90c even with graphics on minimum i ve been reading reports of players with rigs that match or exceed maximum requirement but are also getting performance issues and overheating apparently doing some tweaking on the nvidia control panel remedied some of the performance issues but my temperatures are still pretty high around 83c max also i m pretty sure this game also has memory leak issues because i have 32gb ram but kept getting warning messages about bugs i have a feeling this is a problem of the re engine because i was getting issues like that with the demo of resident evil 4 remake i ve been getting constant crashes during character re customization when using art of metamorphosis i ve legit lost over 30 minutes of customization three times because of that edit i figured out it s related to the background you set up for lightning reference if you use any other than the default one there is a chance it ll crash the game another huge red flag is the fact this single player game launched with a bunch of microtransactions so incredibly scummy reminds me of tales of arise capcom joining the practices of day 1 pay to win dlc is really disappointing fast travel camps items and even character recustomization sure none of them are actual pay to win because they can be found in the actual game but it s still a very bad practice it uses denuvo which definitely plays a role in the bad performance i heard some rumors that it s also using enigma protector too i don t get why two drms in a single player game i feel really bad for itsuno san because he s an incredibly passionate game designer who worked hard to convince capcom to let him make the sequel and fulfill his vision for the original dragon s dogma but this game really needed more time in the oven to polish performance on pc not sure about consoles it s clear the game was released in this state to meet deadlines set by capcom and this whole situation sucks because the game is incredibly fun polishing the gameplay of the original game in a very satisfying way but the glaring performance issues make hard to fully enjoy it at least i didn t encounter any bugs so far aside from occasional pawn pathing which is surprising considering a game of this scope however at the current state i cannot recommend this game even though i m having a huge blast and got my money worth unless you re a diehard fan with a very meaty rig and even so you might have problems with performance
