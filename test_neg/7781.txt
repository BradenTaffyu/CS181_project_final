2022 i cannot recommend this game to anyone as long as the dev will not have done something against server hoppers these guys are just hoping from servers to servers until they find someone who has farmed for hours and then they just sink the poor guy steal their loot and that s all several hours of run ruined by 20 min of server hopping these same guys are the type of guys to spawnkill you in your ship just to humiliate you until you leave if you give up your ship you give up your loot you lose if you try to respawn you die you lose just pointless and annoying if you ever want to chill with your friends this game could be nice but it s not not as long as the devs are allowing the kind of behaviour i described above play some pure pve game meanwhile maybe one day they will cure the community from its cancer
