the game was amazing when i started playing but once it went free to play the game started having an abundance of cheaters lagswitchers and chinese players on a vpn they desync so much that you can t even counter them on time they refuse to region lock and only have 1 server for na the gacha system is very flawed most of the time it is duplicates and they always only give you spectral silk you also have a chance of getting extreme duplicates which still only give you silk i have gotten matari s extreme skin 3 times they also make limited extreme rarity skins that you will have to pay through the gacha system in order to get there are only ever 250 of them and are done within 2 hours because people blow their life saving on it which ruins any chances for anyone with a life to get the skins the game is a scam and the developers do not care about their own product as long as they make money
