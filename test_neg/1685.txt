2022 alright so first of all this despite all the backlash isn t an awful game i d much rather play release tww 3 than the original that being said it s not a good game either ca has pulled the classic 2020s razzle dazzle of releasing a game unfinished and patching it until the backlash stops with every update until now the game has improved overall even if the bugs kept multiplying without a doubt the biggest improvement at least for me so far has been the implementation of the mod support which allowed the community to fill negative space in the design and improve the balancing overall this may change soon though as the immortals empire patch looms over the horizon now would i recommend people to buy this game before ie drops no that doesn t mean it s not worth playing cause i do like playing it and the implementation of ie will bring such a breadth of content to the game that i have no doubts that it will shake up the reviews however i am both excited and scared of how this will turn out because while i have no doubts ie will have me playing hundreds more hours regardless of quality i can t as of yet make comment on how well implemented it will be and how much love will be shown to it and future releases i strongly believe that once this game has gotten the dlc support of tww2 it will be a good game perhaps even a great one however i shall leave this review on negative because let s be honest here this game needed another year of dev time and should have released with more content tho not necessarily ie and way more polish
