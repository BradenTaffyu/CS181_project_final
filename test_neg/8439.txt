2023 i cannot recommend lies of p in it s current state despite having beaten it i enjoyed a great deal of lies of p it has great atmosphere and a decent story however combat the main thing in the game falls apart pretty quickly it s sluggish inputs drop frequently parry is inconsistent enemies delay attacks and their tracking is borderline insulting to the player the first half of the game feels like a pretty good souls like the second half just i don t know what happened past the first two bosses in the game every boss has two phases and two full hp bars and a lot of later boss fights you can t summon a meat shield for a lot of bosses aren t hard just extremely tedious having insane amounts of hp compared to your little damage while you max out around 600 hp enemies can frequently do a single hit on you for 400 if a combo hits you well game over man this is a game that thought people enjoyed souls because it was hard which is missing the point entirely several bosses in this game break the rules also they can animation cancel or change their pattern whenever they want you cannot animation cancel and in fact queue inputs way too far into the future overall i leave disappointed in a really bad dodge mechanic from a game that could ve been an incredible first entry in a franchise to just a slightly above average soulslike
