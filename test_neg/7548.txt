season 12 update well after hundreds of hours it s time to uninstall my wife and i were death spiraling a brig she was getting red x after red x on the cannons masts down anchorballed on fire no chance they somehow stayed afloat suddenly all three come to board us one survives a blunder to the face at the top of the ladder and gets on he s impossible to kill blundered over and over won t take damage we have no holes no damage but he one shots us and we get black screened for 5 minutes then respawn across the map therefore in parting i have some good alternative names for this absolute fockjub of a game sea of grieferssea of hackerssea of spawncamperssea of exploitssea of glitchessea of incompetent devssea of utterly pathetic fps mechanicssea of toxic boarding metasea of hold a button for five seconds to pick up a fish off the skilletsea of i don t want to sit down or place a trinket sea of literally four different buttons to exit different menussea of picking up one farking thing at a time sea of carry 10 cannonballs but only 5 bulletssea of repetitive bossessea of hitregsea of bought and paid for streamerssea of git gud sweatssea of insufferable serverssea of lag in 2024sea of infinite x beard errorssea of lifeless portssea of useless quarter of the map due to sea of homing missile volcanos and sea of exploding surfaces wherever you step hull devs tell me you hate your players without telling me you hate your players worst map design ever the upvotes on this review should be taken seriously by rare your game is borked many hours in now on season 12 and even with easy anti cheat the hacking is insufferable invisibility hacks will allow trolls to board your ship even when you have both ladders covered one shot you in the back anchor you and then spawncamp you this last crew never even sunk our ship they didn t even care about our treasure they just stayed on it and killed us over and over and over again we could shoot them in the face point blank they d spam roll on deck laughing and kill us from across the ship with a one shot blunder we didn t want to scuttle because we d spent hours getting loot seriously aimbots esp hacks and zero damage hacks are utterly horrid the hardcore player base is like oh these hacks don t exist yes they do just google them they ll come up as the first result and somehow rare can t combat this they are widely known and rampant in your game hacking is destroying this game the toxic players destroy this game the horrible hitreg destroys this game how can such an otherwise fantastic game be so so so bad those who know this game know that firing cannonballs in a pirate game is absolutely worthless it s literally a noob move one crewmate can bucket out water faster than you can fire a cannon fighting a ship with more than one player they will never sink if somebody is bucketing so what s the meta step 1 shoot yourself out of a cannon step 2 climb the ladder invisibility shoot through wall with aimbot ancient no sound exploit optional step 3 set fire to the ship optional step 4 camp the spawn points until the other crew gives up yep you never have to even fire a cannonball nice farging pirate game naval battles could be amazing and for those other players who enjoy naval it s been some of the most fun i ve had in a game i don t even care about losing in an intense naval fight and when i m full of holes and they board me and kill me i ll scuttle for them because they won like a real freaking pirate the naval combat is amazing so much strategy involved ammunition management aim trajectory sail height and angle speed it is a freaking masterpiece but again hackers or sweats won t even shoot a cannon they ll simply fire over on a cannon which is utterly stupid board you and anchor your ship then kill you over and over until you choose to scuttle they know where you re going to respawn they have no interest in firing a shot and getting water in your ship they simply rely on piss poor fps shooting mechanics hacks and respawn exploits to wear you down until you finally scuttle and quit it s horrific game design and it s no wonder this game attracts such a scummy player base when i convinced my son to play with us for a little while who is diamond in both apex and fortnite he played a few days and couldn t stand it he said i d rather play a game where the shots register one way rare could fix the utterly stupid and intensely toxic boarding issue retractable ladders simply make the ladders a breakable repairable object like masts wheels or capstans and so people actually have to shoot some cannonballs to lower ladders or ram to board as it stands this is a ridiculous design and something must be done about the spawn camping the scuttle to a different sea seems like an idiotic and utterly lazy solution this issue alone more than any other issue ruins this game and makes people quit it s simply not fun for a game with such awful fps mechanics cannonballs should be the meta it s a pirate game dear rare you make money from selling cosmetics right so you need your player base to keep playing right maybe fix the spawn camping issue so people don t abandon your game so quickly i ve asked ps5 friends to play sot with me and already some have replied that they hated it because the community is toxic that is a problem my kids used to play with me then we got boarded camped and trolled over and over again now they don t want to play it and i m out too beard and graphics card errors i have a 3080 my wife has a 3070 how are we being booted for graphics cards errors almost daily how are we getting network errors flip a coin as to how you re going to lose the loot you spent hours acquiring hackers on one side beard on the other final words do not waste your money or time on this game the devs would rather spend time making fancy trailer videos for instagram than fixing age old bugs combating hackers addressing the horrid hitreg using decent servers and a litany of other pathetic issues season 11 initial review let s start with this this game is amazingly fun to play with family i play with my wife and son and this have an absolute blast until you run into literally any other of the utterly toxic players horrible community simply harasses you until you leave the game there are very obvious cheating issues happening as my son and i have been ddos d while playing it s ridiculous that safer seas penalizes you for wishing not to play with the horrible community but it looks like i ll have to stick with the nerfed safer seas version to keep my router safe from ddos attacks and avoid the absolute arseholes who take joy in trolling new players new ps5 players are going to hate this game because the toxic arsewipes that sweat this game already have plenty of worthless gold and they re only there to grief you it s not worth playing even with safer seas as the game removes captained ships which means you can t sell to sovereigns at the port you have to run each piece of loot half a mile to sell it which makes this game tedious beyond imagination if rare simply let you have captained ships in safer seas mode i d absolutely love it why not allow us to play this masterpiece of a game without the cheating sweaty toxic pvp elements
