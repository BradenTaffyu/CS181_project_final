2023 if you are exploring this game as a new player to total war warhammer i would recommend you steer clear of this franchise for now after playing this game for years it is clear the developers have moved on to a new focus and are simply dragging out this game as a means to invest into other projects this can be seen with the other negative reviews and the 200 of dlc for this game inherently this isn t a bad thing however due to the drive to continue to bring revenue from the franchise at the cheapest cost their new dlc updates have fundamentally broken the game examples of this can be seen in various game crashes poor ai decision making faction abilities not working correctly and multiple quality of life game functionality that has not been implemented correctly fundamentally its the elements above that make the game no longer a pleasure to play and why i would not recommend anyone to buy into this franchise as it stands today it is a huge shame to see such an amazing idea grow into a great product only to be dismantled by poor business practice
