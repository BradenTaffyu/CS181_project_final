this game s player base is horrible and the developers and the publisher are just enabling them you re forced into your xbox gamer tag and as a result i ve been 1 stream sniped while streaming this game2 called repeatedly while being chased by the same people calling me repeatedly3 searched in other places and harassedwhen i complained to microsoft xbox support about this when i changed my gamertag to hide my identity because of this game i was just told to stop streaming it or accept the risk of being harassed in and out of the platform the sea of thieves and rare ltd twitter accounts blocked me for some pre emptive reason i never knew why the developers at some point were talking about more peaceful or pve servers that they never actually implemented and basically showed a middle finger to anyone who actually awaited for private servers and the more casual fun of this game truth is there s no real casual fun in it to have and even pvp players get bored fast servers are emptying fast and you get constantly bounced into another one so you can t even enjoy a simple solo time on a server without trolls the only think this game has going for me is some of the fun game mechanics and graphics and that s about it i m not aversed on pvp or toxic team mates but if i spend hours on end at once to a game i don t want them in my game developers aren t dealing with it so i m not really interested in this game or could even recommend it to anyone
