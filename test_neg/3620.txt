2016 gta v is a massive game massive budget massive open world massive replay ability and massively terrible devs pr singleplayer is fun and probably worth buying all on its own although chances are the real reason you re looking at this game is for gta online do not buy this game solely for the online play in game currency is unreliable and disappears at random bans are handed out to innocent players while game ruining hackers run rampant the servers still feel like a day one release with extremely long loading screens rockstar has some of the worst customer support ever and they use scummy business practices like claiming the game is on sale shortly after artificially inflating the price gta online is a whole new format of pay2win even moderately decent guns and vehicles are reserved for people who hack or use their mother s credit card to buy in game currency to achieve anything legit without spending a fortune you ll have to waste enough hours grinding repetitive races and linear heists to make a mmo player squeamish i ve had tons of fun playing with friends and the single player experience is one of the best i ve ever seen just know what you re getting into before handing your money over to these scumbags for the record i m not salty over a ban or anything i ve had innocent friends get banned unpleasant run ins with rockstar support and one instance where all of my in game money vanished without a trace but this review isn t the result of anything recent or sudden rockstar just sucks in general
