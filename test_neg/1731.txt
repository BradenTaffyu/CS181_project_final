2022 edit there s been several patches since this review so while some things are still relevant others aren t i ll update it as i get the feel for the new stuff when i get around to playing it more total warhammer 3 is the third installment in the total warhammer franchise and it is a good game it is unfortunately also plagued with a ton of design issues and oversights and bugs that makes it hard to recommend as it currently stands the short and sweet of it is that if you absolutely can t wait for more total warhammer this is a nice enough tideover until there s more dlc and the new combined campaign map comes out in a few months but if you re not in a rush or still haven t experienced everything tw2 has to offer definitely stick with that one for a while yet and wait with picking up total warhammer 3 until at the very least the game has had a handful of patches to fix some of the glaring issues with the campaign and some factions or modding support has been added so you can mod those issues away the singleplayer campaign map in the game right now has some agonising mechanics which are a combination of mostly incredibly unrewarding dungeons that penalise you for doing them but are mandatory take 5 7 turns and are only doable with your faction leader s army a race against a handful of other ai factions with an almost immediate loss condition if you don t participate and rifts that pop up across every territory across the gameworld that heavily penalise the area they re in the dungeons the realms of chaos are generally fairly uninteresting slogs with the exception of slaanesh realm it is the only one that has a potential reward as you can get some huge bonuses or great gear if you decide to lose that realm it s very thematic and cool and gives an extra bit of strategy the others are pure penalties and tzeentch in particular is an rng fest which the ai of course doesn t have to deal with they re hard scripted to arrive at the end of the realm after 5 turns you can get around it with a cheat sheet and you might need to if you get behind the ai you lost the realm there s nothing to do unless you happen to catch them to kill them so they get thrown out all of the realms end with a survival battle a long long battle in which you need to survive waves of daemons while getting reinforcement points to summon reinforcements build defensive towers and barricades to help you survive etc the idea is nice and it s fun the first few times but since each of them is so long they get tedious fairly quickly fortunately all but the final one can be auto resolved with a strong enough army as for the rifts you can interact directly with them to close them but it requires either fighting them or having several heroes run around in your territory to close them using money they do have some utility as they allow your faction leader s army to jump between them and only your faction leader for some reason but it s not quite enough to offset the massive penalty they give the area they re in nor the fact they ll spawn hostile heroes and daemon armies wherever the rifts are too the later in the game it gets the harsher those penalties are and stronger the armies are too all this heavily disincentivises aggressive expansionist playstyles as the more territory you have the more rifts there ll be in it and the more heroes or armies you ll have to have patrolling your territory the prologue campaign however is amazing it serves as a narrative introduction to the plot of the main campaign and a tutorial for new players there s not much new for veterans in this campaign in terms of gameplay but its story is the best there s ever been in a total warhammer game moving away from the campaign there was a siege rework that uses many of the same mechanics of the survival battles all minor settlement battles now take place on specific beautiful city maps with several lanes of approach capture points and the possibility of making towers and barricades if you are the defender while they re fun to defend they re not nearly as fun on the attack depending on your faction and the map it can be really frustrating to fight them and especially on higher difficulties you will need to as the auto resolve heavily disfavors the player at those difficulties the towers will continually respawn and they can be very devastating on the flipside it means that if you are the defender you can defend against armies you might not otherwise have been able to as the balance of power is so heavily skewed in your favor the ai is not smart enough to really abuse it the way a player can nor counter that abuse thankfully i do wish there were less of them though the ai rarely attacks my settlements in my experience so i m usually left on the much less fun attacking side walled sieges have had a similar overhaul with their walls now facing in multiple directions and with sprawling lanes defensible chokepoints and of course the same tower and barricade mechanics and capture points i am in the minority who never minded the old style of sieges but there s no denying the new maps are very pretty and that they offer more tactical options than they did before the new factions all have some fascinating new campaign mechanics and i think it s fair to say this is the most complex and interesting a launch roster has been not even taking into account the sheer quantity each race has a very distinct playstyle and identity on the campaign map and to a lesser extent also the battle map which means that the replayability between races is pretty high unfortunately some of them while certainly interesting have a lot of design or implementation issues that means the enjoyment is somewhat diminished as the cracks begin to show the daemon prince for example while based on the super interesting idea of customisation of both himself and his faction falls short by being a very weak legendary lord by himself and running out of things to get fairly early on compared to for instance the tech trees of other races which usually last considerably longer diplomacy had a very cool overhaul where you now get to see just how interested in a deal another faction is what factors are impacting it what you can do to change it and so on it also allows you to trade settlements and create outposts in your allies territory to get access to their units which is an absolutely amazing new feature it lets you supplement your army with up to 4 allied units per army allowing you to shore up weaknesses or just have fun adding some more monsters from other factions some old issues still exist but overall a great overhaul and of course as with many new total war releases there s a slew of variously severe bugs that will absolutely affect the enjoyment of your game as it is now it s very hard for me to recommend picking up the game if you have only a passing interest in the franchise or are new to it and i would strongly suggest anyone interested in the game to wait a bit unless you re absolutely sure you ll be able to overlook the early issues the game has i feel absolutely confident that it ll be a great long term purchase like total warhammer 1 and 2 were but it just doesn t feel completely finished yet so if you aren t absolutely in love with the franchise stay away for at least a few months or until modding tools are out
