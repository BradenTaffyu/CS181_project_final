2020 a paid game with gross amounts of grinding basically equal to f2p games possibly worse if you re not the kind who likes focusing on a single game or simply can t invest absurd amounts of time on it really don t buy it considering that it s a fun game especially if you can play with friends and voice chat which ain t a big deal as honestly any multiplayer game can be fun with friends now about in game content objectives are barely existent do generators cleanse the totem if the killer got a good meta hex like ruin you can literally win every match in less than 8 minutes as a survivor if you didn t get a braindead team that infinitely farms each other against a camping killer and so on honestly this game is a waste of time but addicting it s the case when the developers actually have a nice and fun idea but they re probably greedy asf and bad at managing stuff
