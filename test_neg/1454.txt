2022 longtime warhammer fan over 500 hours in warhammer 2 about 50 hours in this game also 500 likes for this review thank you homies im so glad that i can help so many people decide if they want this game or not abbreviated review don t buy this game start with warhammer 2 with moral empires you ll have a much more fun time especially if you re new to the series wh3 might have potential when mortal empires comes out for it but you ll just be re buying the other games so i find it hard to justify wh3 is buggy tedious and has a campaign design that in my opinion is designed to simply not be fun additonally wh3 is currently in it s vanilla state at this time meaning that without a doubt dlc after dlc will be introduced to make this game that is currently a bit bland and unbalanced into a playable experiance if you do plan to buy this game be prepared to sink several hundred dollars in total to grab all it s dlc s detailed review wh3 s main issue is it s campaign that makes the game extremely unpleasant to play without exaggeration the second most blaring issue is that the game feels very unfinished bare bones and unbalanced which is already paving the way for overpriced dlc s as for the storyline it s bad but in a way you might not expect most games have a main quest but provide players the freedom to pursue it whenever they are ready or feel like it this is not the case with wh3 the main quest basically soaks up the entire experience which is starkly different from the other two entrees that allowed for a more sandbox empire building campaign which i think is what most people were expecting these sandbox elements of warhammer 3 are quite fun when you have the chance to play them but again the main quest line quite obtrusively prevents you from really enjoying this core of the game you re gunna get sick of this main questline very quickly basically spoilers ahead the game is a race to acquire four demon souls before the other factions you have very little capacity to stop the other factions and if you fall behind in this race there s a chance your ten hour campaign will all be for nothing several rifts into the chaos realms open up across your empire that you have to constantly close and use as teleporters to reach these demon souls where you have to fight a total of 5 quest battles each about one hour long ontop of dozens more within the realm of chaos extremely tedious if you don t close these rifts they will spawn armies and spread corruption across your empire hence being an expansionist empire like how 90 of players want to play is highly discouraged because more lands equals more rifts perhaps you re beginning to see how many like myself accuse this main quest of being obnoxious the chaos realms themselves which is where you go when you enter the rifts are even worse especially the tzeench realm which in my opinion needs to be completely redone basically you have to spend time in these four chaos realms to capture the demon soul where you have to fight dozens of repetitive battles and finally a long and tedious quest survival battle where your whole army is likely to die the longer you spend in these chaos realms the more likely you are to acquire absolutely crippling weakness to your character that s essentially impossible to avoid based on how long you have to spend in the realms oh and by the way there s zero reward for completing a chaos realm and capturing a soul none you just get a soul which is one of four steps to get to the final battle which is it s own can of worms why do you have to do all this like i said i ve never seen a game that pressures the player to pursue the main quest more than wh3 if you don t do this the other factions will get the souls first and you lose are you like me and you just wanna build an empire at your own pace explore the map fight the factions and be a strategist sorry all that matters is the main quest line you absolutely must use your main lord army too when entering these rifts you can t send a second army to make it easier seriously idk what these developers were thinking i guess creatively assembly hates their fans perhaps the biggest slap in the face is that even after you beat the final battle more on that later the rifts keep opening lololol so if you get this game you can enjoy endless rifts that need closing tedious chaos quest battles and crippling character traits because you spent too much time in the chaos realm enjoy your anxiety driven easter egg hunt they call a campagin that s what i can tell you that you will get after playing this game for a total of about 50 hours on my two accounts dont even get me started on the final battle have fun playing an hour long battle just to lose at the very end after you ve successfully defeated the main boss and have your whole army die by the endless enemy reinforcements in my game my lord bugged out too and wouldn t move during the final battle which is pretty the game is buggy but not exceptionally buggy compared to other new releases final battle is a rage fest that s way too hard and takes too long to fight it s very easy to exploit the thing to farm supplies and win that way which is arguably cheating but if you actually try to win the battle the way it was designed you re gunna be spending hours just to watch your grand army fade away even if you do win go ahead and bring a doom stack you ll still have high casualties the final battle is one of five survival battles that are cool in theory but are like an hour long each and extremely costly i really respect the attempt making a challenging survival battle but it needs alot of work if someone makes a mod where you can just turn off the entire ursun main quest entirely that d be awesome and maybe i d give it another try for now though i wouldn t advise you to get this game and that s coming from a major total war fan the story line absolutely blows is tedious and the new factions aren t very remarkable to compensate they are quite unbalanced too lots and lots of dlc s will have to come out to make this game fun so that s why i would recommend war hammer 2 with moral empires on sale you ll have an equally fun campaign experience without the most obnoxious and intrusive story line in the history of total war games to be fair it s likely ca will address the trash storyline or someone will mod it to just disable these silly rifts perhaps then the game will feel less like a rectal thermometer to play the second of the two glaring issues i have with wh3 is the greedly dlc grab this game has potential but be prepared that to get the full experiance you will almost certianly have to drop hundreds of dollars into dlc currently they re actually charging about 2 dollars for a dlc that enables blood and gore yep you just read that right the game has the word war in the title twice and the base game doesnt have any blood and gore not only that but they re seriously charging their fans for a dlc in order to enable blood and gore they re actually charging a dlc in order to access graphics i could certianly say more but i think you can make your own judgement on the moral charachter of ca and how they see their fans like most games these days unfortunately wh3 is in it s bare bones vanilla state if you buy this game you will get access to 7 playable factions one of which is chaos undivided which is just a combinaiton of the others so really it s only 6 i personally find this pretty light but its up to you if you think that s enough to justify a 60 dollar purchase also 5 7 of these factions are evil and not everyone likes to play as the baddies thats just one guy s thoughts you i hope you decide if this game is right for you
