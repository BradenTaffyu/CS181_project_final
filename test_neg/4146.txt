2016 with this review i m focussing on the gta online mode the story mode is pretty good but the multiplayer has a lot of problems which i will address in this review first off all rockstars ban policy gta online bans are the result of automated analysis related to modding in gta online exploiting or abusing game mechanics or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience you can be literally banned for griefing or glitching instead of fixing the existing problems with gta online that could prefent people from griefing glitching they push out another supercar worth 3 milion so that people buy there stupid sharkcards now lets go on to there servers i have one word for them they dont properly you lose connection to them constantly and the are so slow it takes around 40 seconds or so to connect to them which is ridiculous and finally the community it is so toxic and because of this i try to join the least populated servers possible this is possibly the reason rockstar is trying to ban griefers but even if that is the reason then i still don t think that that is reasonable
