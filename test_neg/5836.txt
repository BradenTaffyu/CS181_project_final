2018 the game is indeed better than csgo but the community sucks always want to kick ppl out if a teammate is noob get kick is ok but this is not loading take less than 30 sec they start to kick ppl out wtf not just that for me i m poor don t have much money so i can t afford all operators when i use recruit they kick me out also wtf is wrong with this community so overall i really like the game but i would not recommend this game to anyone that hate community
