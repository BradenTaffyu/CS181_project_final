2022 edit first lol the people proving my point about the toxic players like you literally couldn t have validated that part of my review any more than you have in replies saying just skill issue or just insults is removed actual convos only be civil second not mad just honest i never said i wasnt going to keep playing just pointing out flaws its a review after all i am just saying if you dont like rust skip this its pirate rust its not a good casual game yes i play it every night on a galleon i bought with 3 other friends doesnt mean solo play isnt almost entirely trash for the most part lack of people isn t the issue its lack of balance for solo players third no one cares that you never saw a cheater they still exist they still mess with people and all that proof is on youtube game needs a report button i have 200 hours in 40 days i saw 6 i ll start by saying i love the game but it has a lot of stuff that makes me feel like i cant recommend it past if you re a rust player who wants to be a pirate and abuse certain parts of the game the game is super fun super atmospheric and when you can at least fight people and get in ship battles and have a fair fight it s super fun looks great feels great easy to pick up hard to master it s even better with friends that said there s a few flaws with the game a few but the issue is that they are very big and obvious flaws within sea of thieves land combat combat in the game is really really simple but is infested with people who abuse bugs and mechanics to cheese this really shows when you literally can t do anything as a solo player against anyone who isn t solo due to these terrible bugs and mechanics people abuse within the combat system you want to sword fight someone well unless you got a group of buddies the same size as them prepare to have people animation cancel with the sword lunge to fly 35 yards and one shot you if you were too busy fighting their duo or the duo just shoots you in the back with a blunderbuss or pistol you wanna sword fight 1v1 nah they ll just abuse the fact that you can phase through players to just keep running through you and your block to hit you in the back or reload as they do it to blunderbuss pistol you in the back player collision needs to be a thing it d solve a lot of the issues this game has with combat feeling terrible why have a constant block just make it a parry ship combat the second issue is that in ship combat people will usually do anything but fight with cannons usually people do two things which is they opt to use a bunch of these silly specialty cannonballs that disable steering force anchor drops disable guns disable barrels from being accessed so you cant repair put you to sleep etc it goes on those balls should be pve only and used less by skelly ships because the ability to spam those on players makes ship combat a bit of a joke when a brig can lock your guns down permanently because they went around and collected a bunch of peace balls it s that or people will often just not even fight instead they launch themselves from their cannon to your ship bit of a dumb mechanic as well it should leave you half dead and crippled for balance and firebomb the whole deck or they just swim under you with bomb barrels and cause so much damage its impossible to not be sunk unless you have two or more crew mates unless you re a 2 crew on a mid or large sized ship you simply cant defend against it the smallest ship basically just insta sinks when one of those goes off under the deck or they put one down below one up top wreck the mast and steering wheel and then if you fight it sinks you repair they kill you as you try and it sinks the small ship is just too weak to the bomb barrels this is again well more apparent when you re playing solo digging up a chest and cant be at your ship to even defend it let alone see the person coming then your whole ship is gone treasures gone quest maps are gone and all they had to do was drop on barrel in the bottom deck not fun sure you can shoot the barrel as they carry it but again im not at the ship im following my maps cheating the third issue is hackers given the age of the game its kind of surprising the lack of ability to actually report someone that i ve seen i had some 16 year old following me around flying to my ship and spawning dropping bomb barrels at my location with less than a second on the timer left and you literally cannot defend against it they fly over head drop them you get blasted if you arent on a bigger ship you re just done i tried to leave and find a new game same server i literally cannot play the game when that happened from the barrel hacker then they just sit on the beach as my ship is sinking with me in it in voip spamming hahah you re bad while their voice cracks and they laugh about sinking you using barrel hacks super fun oh report the dude can t there s no way to see other crews unless you spyglass them but they just fly away before i can get a name its pretty rare but it happens super fun pvp pvp while being a draw to the game is also a factor that costs this game most of the new players it gets as of now you get sunk and you spawn nearby and can be attacked endlessly if there is a cheater they can bully you endlessly currently pvpers can come at you just trying to enjoy the narrative content of the game and steamroll you endlessly while risking nothing at all and stealing quest items they cant even sell you know what would fix these issues in a heartbeat though pve only servers another thing that would fix it your ship sinks and you go to a new server i hear that may become a thing but right now nah a third fix 2 servers pvp double rewards pve normal fix four pve servers that make you use a different pirate than pvp servers so you can do casual stuff in pve and trick the pve pirate out and have a pvp pirate and do stufff there to trick them out on a pvp server so you can do both depending on what you wanna do at that time pvp purists dont like that though they claim that it would make the game worse or kill it but it wouldn t they do all it would do is force them to do more than grief people because it would require they need to be face people who know how to pvp arent new and they want easy loot so they cry about people just wanting to enjoy the game pvp should be end game not thee game in its entirety greifing the game for pvp is at least 75 of the time people greifing you while they spam slurs insults at you in voice chat you spawn on your ship to fire in the spawn spot and being shot you scuttle the ship and try to move on but it spawns you 2 minutes away so they rush over and sink you for literally nothing then complain when you dont interact with them its not a fun game because the older players make it unfun i cant recommend it to casuals being that its very unfriendly to new players with the odd mechanics for combat ship fights bad pvp pve balance i just cant say it doesn t make the game somewhat unplayable because it does i know a bunch of people who abuse said mechanics grief are just going to say get good or whine about suggesting they should be gone or nerfed but that s the truth if you dont like gimmicks in your games that make the interesting parts worse this game probably aint for you if you can handle that its not balanced and the current player base tries to make new players quit and cheaters that can ruin a lobby sometimes then hit this game up its still fun just annoying when it all happens and it happens a lot if they fix the silly mechanics and bad pvpve balance i ll for sure swap my review but yeah those are just not fun parts of the game and they really need a way to report cheaters and toxic players easily
