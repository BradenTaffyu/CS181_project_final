2016 the concept of this game is fun but it s technical shortcomings make it an unplayable when trying to play with your friends the lobby system is straight up broken 8k active people playing the game right now and my group of 2 other friends and myself have been queued for 25 minutes that s just unacceptable this isn t a new problem either the game has had lobby issues since release and the devs have either been unable or unwilling to fix them it s a shame because it really does break what otherwise would be a relatively fun albeit flawed game other criticisms incluce a completely unecessary and immersion breaking ranking system which encourages people to exploit play selfishly and otherwise ruins the tension of the experience numerous graphical and performance bugs which cause frame rate dips rubber banding teleporting and getting stuck on invisible terrain all servers are listen servers hosted by the killer no dedicated servers no server browser forces you to use broken lobby system
