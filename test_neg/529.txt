2019 i m start by saying that this was a great game for the longest time super simple fun in comp causals or in the arcade type modes i ve spent a many a nights with a couple of cold ones and freinds gathered around the appartment living room just playing on dust 2 for hours and have had a great time doing it however this game is the absolute worst when it comes to people using aimbots wallhacks etc it used to be that you d get one every now and then and you just report him and hope he gets banned and join a new lobby since they made the game free getting banned doesnt matter any more they just start up a new steam account and jump back in i mentioned earlier that finding someone who is actually botting would be a rare ish occurance but tonight i attempted to get some new friends into the game and in the first 3 lobbys 1 casual dustii 2 arms race there where botters just one taping everyone from lundicris angles and distances i know botting is gonna happen but like dang calm down are you so frustrated that the only thing you can do to release that is to boot up a program and no skill your way through matches so after my friends got killed over and over again but some resentful basement dewller i suggested we play a round of competitve surely there wont be as many hackers there right nope had some guy boosting his friends with an aim bot the guy had like a 90 headshot ratio by half time and could hit just about everyone no matter what was going on his account was permently banned by the end of the match but does it matter his friends accounts that were being destroyed by my new to game friends got a comp win due to a series of aimbot aces the guy who was aimboting has probably already created a new account and is back in comp right now boosting his proabally silver 4 friends and now i have 4 friends who dont want to play this game simply because of this experience this may seem like a rant cause it kinda is but i m just tired of it no one wants to play a game with no chance to win the games community will die down evenutally to where there are only devout cs fans botters and the passing interested gamer making this game free to play was a big mistake that i dont believe can be ratified if you have a counterpoint or dissagree with what i said then let me know
