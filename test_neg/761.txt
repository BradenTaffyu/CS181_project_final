2016 you want a good tightly balanced classic online pvp shooter you re prepared to deal with idiocy extremely childish behaviour herd insinct insults harassment copious amounts of griefing high pitched teenager voices bossing you around and boasting about intercourse with your mother you realize the team is just an excuse to boost your ego if you re carrying it or to boost your rank if you re getting carried as actual teamwork is a rather foreign concept to this game you re already fed up with cod also you are male or willing to pretend go crazy this is just the game for you if on the other hand you re looking for fruitful teamplay if you expect adult like behaviour a respectfully competitive environment that gives you a chance to learn and improve communication with deeper vocabulary than gg ez rekt and ur mom in other words anything that won t give you the feeling you somehow ended up in an elementary school recess then fly you fool there s nothing in this for you but salt very bitter salt find better things to do with your time and money support innovative game concepts for example instead of encouraging valve to keep milking a franchise whose core gameplay hasn t evolved in a decade give your support to independent studios instead of paying to play cops and robbers with licensed gun designs that benefit arms manufacturers tl dr the game is alright mediocre the community is horrible carry on your merry way don t waste your sanity smiley out
