70 and the game barely runs with specs well above the recommended dozens of micro transactions and limitations to induce fomo such as the item used to change your appearance art of metamorphosis being limited at the rc shop but purchasable for real money on steam everything regarding the gameplay itself is comparable to it s predecessor therefore it s good but i d recommend waiting for a sale or multiple performance patches and bug fixes
