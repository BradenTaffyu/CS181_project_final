2018 first of all starter edition is a scam do not buy it it becomes a korean mmorpg level of grinding if you do the gameplay itself is fun and while it s usually a good thing to have continued support for a title the devs are cleary trying to milk their playerbase dry with recent changes it strongly suffers from powercreep with new characters being usually unbalanced compared to older ones and they are limited to people who paid for that year s season pass for a week in advance leaving the rest of the playerbase at their mercy balance patches take too long and recently they haven t been addressing real player issues but only statistical analysis of the matches like limiting operators gadget based on average number of uses instead of checking real ranked match data the recent addition of real money only loot boxes is also something that sounds fishy especially because it came with the price rise of every new cosmetic item for in game money on top of selling season passes every new year i cannot recommend this game or any ubisoft game really to a friend of mine i would strongly advise you against buying into this game because the corporate culture surrounding it sounds extremely negative and anti consumer
