2017 after a break of a few weeks i log on only to be confronted by a message informing me that rockstar stripped me of all the money i obtained legitimately by actually playing the game instead of cheating without money this game is unplayable and to even reach a point where you have enough money to actually enjoy playing the game takes forever and feels more like a job than a game and no i will not pay for shark cards because i already paid for the game when i bought it if this is the way paying customers are treated i can think of better ways to spend my money uninstalled
