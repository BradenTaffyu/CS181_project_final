2016 update for the update game looks worse runs just as bad and the balance is now utterly abysmal don t waste your money the developers have no clue what they re doing this game needs some serious help matchmaking slow at best downright broken at worst connection inconsistent with some matches being unplayable due to lag loading ssds appear to be meaningless get ready for long unexplained loading don t get me wrong this game is insanely fun beyond a few bad decisions by the developers that said there are far too many bugs keeping me from just playing the game please developers dedicated servers consistent matchmaking especially single player queue and a more informative loading screen please i ll recommend this game when it can actually be played to a significant extent
