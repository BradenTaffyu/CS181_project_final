product received for free i ve spent 125 hours in the game and while it s a good game it s just too grindy for me despite all the time i ve put in it still feels like i m at the beginning i have to reformat my character so many times and it s really hard to get resources if you don t want us to lose interest in the game you need to address these issues quickly or you re going to lose a lot of players
