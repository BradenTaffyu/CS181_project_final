2015 would have easily recommended this game before steam s 2015 summer sale fantastic game incredibly immersive tons of fun but sadly i won t be recommending any rockstar games anymore the company essentially bundled in game cash dlc with the base game raised the price of the bundle to 80 and marked the bundle 25 off so that it sold on sale for the regular base price of 60 on top of this rockstar initially pulled the base game from their store page which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale to top everything off though purchasing the cash card bundle is basically rockstar s way of skirting around steam s new refund policy buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours it s a move i m just disappointed i ve already given rockstar my money wish i could get it back won t be buying another rockstar game anytime soon
