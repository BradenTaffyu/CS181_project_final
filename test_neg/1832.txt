2022 this game has singlehandedly convinced me to never buy a game upon release ever again the fact that we ll have to wait nearly a year after release to play a finished game with hopefully most bugs and imbalances addressed is absolutely wild to me i d recommend sticking to wh2 a functional game with high replay value edit 08 18 23 ca continues to disappoint saying that their newest dlc is costing more than any other yet released with less content than any other released is due to costs rising is ridiculous their financial report for 2022 states that their increased profits are due to revenue increasing faster than costs do the math
