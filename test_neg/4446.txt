2016 great concept rubbish implementation the core ideas of warframe are ace get a load of powers and guns smash weird enemies in varied environments all the while getting stronger add onto this a solid movement system as well as an initially rewarding progression system and warframe should have the strength of core gameplay to barrel right through minor flaws of balancing or uneven progression mechanics unfortunately warframe doesn t have minor issues with progression it s infested with them while most of the epynomous warframes are all if not balanced then at least varied the vast majority of the game s massive arrray of weapons exist only to level so that you can progress the weird and clunky mastery mechanic whereby you get to take a series of uninteresting tests to unlock some but only a few of the more advanced weapons the mechanic does provide some advantages to levelling new weapons but only once you re long past the point of painfully grinding a progression of dull nondescript weapons instead of getting to play with whatever your favourite is compounding the issue newer stuff is almost always better and rather than spending any effort on balance the devs created a system of random powerups the variance of which is so massive that it will make weapons either embarassingly overpowered or actually provide bonuses to stats that the weapon does not posess it s a mess of a system and only the most extreme signal that digital extremes haven t got the faintest idea what to do with their game recommendation play it for a bit it s free and the core gameplay isn t bad but be very aware that you re far better off waiting a long time before spending anything on the game s ridiculously overpriced rmt offerings further this is no blizzard or riot game don t expect well thought out development in tndem with the ridiculously priced monthly rmt content packs
