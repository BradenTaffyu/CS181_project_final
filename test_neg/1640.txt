2023 i ve invested approximately 2000 hours across the trilogy enthusiastically purchased all the accompanying dlcs however the recent unveiling of dlc both in terms of the quantity quality of content has left me deeply disappointed although this game was released 18 months ago subsequent game updates dlc releases have been sporadic and uninspiring the neglect of numerous established factions such as norsca lizards the empire is glaringly evident as they languish and stagnate without comprehensive campaign revamps similarly game 3 factions like nurgle cathay ogres desperately require a reimagining of their hero traits technology trees skill lines the ai both in battle on the campaign map displays a baffling lack of strategic prowess and fails to present any meaningful challenge myriad bugs are introduced with each patch especially painful given the now lengthy patch cycles what s most disappointing is the unfavorable comparison of immortal empires to mortal empires ie s lack of polish heightened bug count inferior performance worse ai late game states are all noticeable obtaining substantive information from creative assembly has proven as challenging as extracting blood from a stone the lack of meaningful communication regarding the issues fans are experiencing is frustrating and disheartening recent comments posted by rob bartholomew show how out of touch ca is to our concerns a thinly veiled threat and a corporate smokescreen of deal with it it s painful to witness the unrealized potential of the game and see the community s valid concerns seemingly brushed aside my patience has worn thin my goodwill eroded the culmination of underwhelming content neglect of core aspects and the persistent influx of bugs and unresolved issues is unacceptable perhaps in the years ahead ca and sega will manage to rectify these deep seated issues it s unfortunate to part ways with a franchise i ve held in high regard for so long but until significant improvements are made i cannot in good conscience continue to support this franchise
