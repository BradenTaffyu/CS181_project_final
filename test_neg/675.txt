2023 it s incredibly unnecessary for cs2 especially in this state to entirely replace csgo while updating to source engine 2 is a welcomed change this game only supports the bare bones features of the original csgo it feels like a real disservice to the people who play cs for arms race flying scoutsman and even danger zone all of which are entirely unavailable in this version of the game games take time to develop that s fine csgo of course had an insanely rough launch it just feels scummy to force the playerbase to convert to a game which only features standard play ffa deathmatch and wingman the most offensive thing about this is that there is zero support for workshop community maps which are not only a pillar of csgo s brand but have always been a beloved aspect of the source engine s greater community as a whole this game looks fantastic it runs amazingly and its really fun but its missing a lot of what people loved about csgo
