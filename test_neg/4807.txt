2023 where do i even start not only is this a 70 map update with a few added guns and about 4 of them are good and the meta has already been formed but the awful armory system from mw2 made its return once again in somehow a worse state than it was before not only do you have to level every single gun and don t unlock 90 of the useful attachments until its basically maxed out but now if you want a certain attachment you get stuck behind their new mechanic daily challenges to unlock everything you want this gun well you need to go do 3 daily challenges want this perk gear daily challenges kill streak daily challenges i mean how do you make a system that no one liked in the previous cod and make it even worse why do we have to reinvent the wheel every single year thinking you re being innovative and cool news flash no one wants this system but the devs don t care once again they dropped a half assed game that took no time to create and it ll die in a few weeks and they ll just keep putting more skins in the game they don t care about their player base haven t in a decade would never recommend this game to anyone save your money this game is not in any way worth a single second of your time
