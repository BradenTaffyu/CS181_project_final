poorly optimized and massively overhyped remake of the first game with same issues developers didn t listen to the community when all of the issues with the first dragons dogma were adressed and it shows for me in singleplayer role playing game the most important is the story which in dragons dogma 2 is as poorly written and as boring as in the first game it s also very short you may think you barely scratch main story and you may actually be more than halfway thru only good thing i can think of is combat but even that has it s flaws less spells per class than first game also feels a bit clunky with some classes some spells have dope animations and visual effects i only hope i could see them without my fps dropping to 20ish fps whenever i cast them overall not a bad game i would give it 6 10 but for this price it s realy not worth it if you for example haven t played the witcher 3 for some reason you can go and do that you ll pay less and have way more fun and way better overall experience
