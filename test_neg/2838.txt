2017 gta series was one of my favorite franchises ever i ve been playing gta since the first one i loved these guys so much but with gta v they showed their true colors and how only money matters to them they showed you can crap on your fanbase because they re suckers that will still buy your games and content previously i wrote a bad review because of some big flaws in the game including how the game stopped working and support didn t want to help me and multiple complaints overall then two days later i got banned my characfter was reset all my money vehicles and my house were erased from history this is unacceptable behaviour the devs are greedy that never care about their customers and fans they mentioned cheating i never cheated in gta v not even in sp i never even had any shady software open at the same time as gta i did run into an incident with a cheater that kept killing me whilist being invulnerable after we got in some argument and he threatened to get me banned but it was quite a while before that i did have recording of everything but of course nobody from rockstar support cared cheaters can just steal your name and get you banned it s the simplest thing whether my ban and reset were because of my review or because some cheater used my name and people reported him while he was using my name it doesn t matter this isn t a company i will ever forgive a highly priced game with an noline system built to extort money from you if you want progression otherwise you will grind for dozens after dozens after dozens of hours to get some cool vehicles a nice house and whatever a system built on purpose to make you want to pay extra for stuff i never minded grinding much in games because it adds purpose but in this case it s total and rip off on top of the game price an 8 000 000 shark card costs 74 99 euros you know what that money will get you in game a nice car with mods that s all it might seem like a lot if you didn t play the game but no shark cards indeed because this company that many grew up with and loved ate their fans alive they re a shark tank themselves the game is also ridden with some nasty bugs optimized like hell cp2077 has graphics10 times better has a bigger world and advanced graphical technologies and works with 20 more fps than gta v a game released quite some years ago if rockstar ever wants to redeem themselves they will need to stop destroying their players hard work in their online game they will let people enjoy the game without intervening they owuld fix what s broken awful product awful company awful everything it s just a money siphon for them and as a reference 74 99 euros would be too much even for 8 billion in game cash not million because the money goes away fast the more expensive vehicles house you have the more you pay for in game daily fees and one day in gta v is not 24 hours either it s 48 minutes
