this game was my childhood bo3 has the absolute best zombies experience however exploit after exploit makes this game unsafe to play there used to be a rce exploit meaning if someone wanted too they could brick your pc or make you install viruses that got fixed after a years of it being in the game now it seems that the servers are compromised and some pcs are flagging the game to have malware in it it is shocking how little activision seems to care tldr 9 years later and this game is priced as a full triple a game while simultaneously being borderline malware and activation is doing next to nothing to fix it
