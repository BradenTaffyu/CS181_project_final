2020 early access review you re looking at my hours played and at the overwhelmingly positive rating and you re wondering why i m not recommending it well i m wondering too this was one of the very few games i actually felt hyped about and i bought it as soon as it was released i ve had fun with it and it s a competently made game with a fun central gimmick so what gives at its core it s pretty simple while noita is fun it s also really miserly when it comes to doling out that fun and that s something that just really rubs me the wrong way pay your taxesone of the frustrating things noita does is something more rogue like games do the game s mechanics are conditional under a tax you have to pay and that tax is you being forced not to use the mechanics in noita it comes in the form of a time tax and an inventory tax see when you start a new game noita isn t fun your starting items are garbage so you have to find good items before you can start having fun but the first level is purpose made to be absolute trash to navigate with a fresh character and the items you can find there are often poor there are other forms of time tax such as the character being really slow but most of it is that first level the other tax is the inventory tax see the point of noita is that you make your own magic wands from wands you find in the levels these are random and often not very good in standard play you can only edit items in the saferoom at the end of the level which means you always have to sacrifice one of your four and slots to carry found wands to the end of the level pray to rngesusyes yes i know complaining about rng in a roguelike the problem is a good run in this game depends on luck to an extreme degree for instance there s no real healing in noita with a scant few exceptions and you will take damage in fact the reason you now start with a flask of water is because catching on fire before you could get one was a run ending first level problem so your capacity to look for new stuff depends on your health which you can increase with an item found in the levels if you have bad luck and don t find many that s most likely a junk run for you can t find good wands or spells in the levels or at the saferoom junk run bad perk selection junk run bad luck in one level makes you much more susceptible to bad luck in the following level because it directly limits your capacity for exploration and it doesn t end there oh no there s a wizard enemy who can teleport your butt to random places on the map better hope it s not too harsh the worms that traverse the level can straight up destroy the saferoom for which the game blames you spawning a strong enemy in every saferoom that you have to fight it s even in the enemy placement because damage comes easy in noita clear an obstacle and see a lightning wizard good luck with your new run in the correct quantities these mechanics are all fine the way noita piles them up makes the game feel extremely arbitrary point and shootnoita s core mechanic is that it simulates every pixel being probably the first real game to actually have a good reason to have pixel art it s pretty cool not gonna lie the fact that you can empty a flask and dip it in liquid in the level to fill it up with is pretty unique but it doesn t really do a lot with this despite the environment being fully destructible you ll only rarely use it to tackle problems and then half the time only by accident there s very little interaction between the environment and the player aside from digging passages to get somewhere when you get down to it noita is basically just a sidescrolling shooter where you sort of get to decide what bullets you shoot even the kick your wizard can do to move loose objects is horrible there s a massive delay it s inaccurate and sometimes barely moves an object oh and enemies that are too close to an object when you kick it are likely to get no damage this all comes back to the game just plain not wanting to give you the tools to have fun the explosives in the levels are a good resource to blast passages if you have no digging tools or just blow up enemies with so why is my only way to move them around the worst kick in video game history while i m a bloody wizard you still here ok look noita isn t a bad game it s more what you d call a diamond in the rough but boy it s rough you re going to have fun with it no doubt about it but you re also going to get pants on head frustrated by it because it s a fantastic idea marred by execution that s both really arbitrary and really afraid to give the player too many tools oh and i almost forgot one of the new features added is a perfect example of my complaints your wizard can drink liquid present on the map if it s a potion or similar you gain its effects if it s inert it simply disappears previously you could keep doing it and it was somewhat of a tool to lower the fluid level somewhere the developers thought this was too powerful a tool apparently your wizard now has a limited amount of stuff he can eat drink i wasn t aware of this thing breaking the game in any way but ok it doesn t end there however no no no you also take damage if you overeat drink and overeating drinking reduces your already slow movement speed this isn t fun this is a garbage mechanic with no purpose other than to limit the player the only other game i know that has a similar mechanic is kingdom come that is a game with an autistic dedication to realism this is a game where you play a spellcasting wizard with a jetpack if i want to chug a trench of whiskey because the game hasn t deigned to give me proper digging tools yet can you just let me do it this feels too much like playing d d with a dm who feels threatened by your character s capabilities
