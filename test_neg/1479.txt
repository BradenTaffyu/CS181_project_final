2022 one step forward two steps back the predecessor to this game total war warhammer ii is a masterpiece of a game that brought thousands of new players into the series it was very flawed in the early days but had the foundations you look for in a good strategy game engaging ai distinct identities between factions and interesting and engaging mechanics at the end of its lifespan the game had ironed out all of its issues except for three main issues the simplified and repetitive major settlement battles compared to historical titles in addition to a lack of minor settlement battles clunky simplified and unclear diplomatic mechanics and the base game campaign the vortex race was unfun and a complete mess total war warhammer iii was developed with the hope that all of these issues would be resolved it was clear on launch that this would not be the case the developers learned nothing from their development of the race for the vortex and made a campaign that was somehow worse the realms of chaos removes agency from the player and gives them severe penalties for both engaging with and failing to engage with the mechanics the campaign was so bad that the top mod on the steam workshop for six months was a mod that removed the core mechanic entirely sieges did not fare much better the developers wanted survival battles with mobile tower defense game mechanics to be the central focus battles of the realms of chaos campaign and decided to port many of the same mechanics to sieges and minor settlement battles to make defending them more interesting the end result was that every settlement battle became a de facto siege battle and with the developers only creating one or two maps per race and the ai avoiding field battles players end up having most of their battles be these repetitive slow and punishing settlement battles diplomacy definitely was improved coming into the third game in the trilogy but came with notable downsides confederation already difficult in total war warhammer ii became almost impossible due to the developers reworking the mechanic and disallowing the player from using gold to influence the other faction s opinion this has actually influenced the way the ai operates in the campaign with many more factions but each faction remaining relatively small and insignificant relative to the player immortal empires the combined map including territory and factions from all three games was supposed to fix most of the issues with the game what it did was highlight many of the issues that went unnoticed for the six months prior to it coming out the developers had made many changes to the game that powered down most factions in the game justifying it by powering down the ai factions as well how many game developers draw players in to their new games by removing features and powering down the player almost all game developers try adding more features in or changing the focus of the features to differentiate them from the old mechanics total war warhammer iii is a game that is not quite ready yet and might not be as good as its predecessor for a long time i cannot recommend it now to a new player but i might change my opinion in the future if the developers make changes to improve the game experience
