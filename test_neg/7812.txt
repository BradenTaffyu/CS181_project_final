really fun core gameplay loop and beautiful visuals spoiled by terrible implementation you have the exciting choices of 1 drop into a public crew and make zero progress because they re all children afk or totally clueless 2 play solo sloop and lose hours of your time every day because some group of sweaty nerds in voice comms chased you around until you finally made a mistake or took your loot into the red sea because they re too cowardly to fight in hourglass or look for a lobby with other active reaper emissaries 3 play hourglass with your friends if you have any 4 the exciting new option of playing in a private session with half the content missing from the game and progression cut down to 30 of the base speed with the emissary boost also not available because god forbid you grind out hundreds of hours of cosmetic unlocks slightly faster don t buy this game unless you want to experience the same getting griefed by nasal voiced dweeby teenagers who have the spare time to waste 12 hours following people around life you might know and love from games like rust ark and dayz
