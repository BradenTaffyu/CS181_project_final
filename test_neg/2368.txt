2021 great game don t play it i was playing pubs the other day there was this wraith with some name like nrg aimzz in my squad i thought to myself yeahh if this fellow is from nrg this is going to be an easy game fast forward to mid game i died i had time to watch this wraith he was third partying some teams from high ground with a wingman he hit 2 3 shots in 5 mags very uninspiring i reckoned i then went on to express my disbelief that this wraith was not at all associated with nrg i said nrg my ass lol this good fellow then typed reported and decided to talk me the rest of the game i didn t take anything seriously this is an online game after all some people can t take jokes and that s just too bad he dropped one last hahahahaha in chat as i died the second time thus wiping our squad he told me how little damage i did compared to him on voice chat and that i was so bad etc just before i left well that was a cringe game i got an email today saying my account has been suspended for a week for hateful conduct citing chatlogs 2021 12 06t22 21 46z armed potato nrg my ass lolok fair i thought even though he must ve been disabled the profanity filter that comes on by default i used the phrase my ass in the chat and therefore might ve hurt his feelings i regret not reporting him back after all that banter though i m just going to play something else tonight maybe this will stop my crippling apex addiction i went on to log in to origin to play swbf ii but there was a problem my whole account got suspended i couldn t log in to origin at all i could only see the store couldn t even see the games that i bought i also can t get access to my user settings for i need my origin id stuff to appeal to the ban so why did i write all this because you too can abuse this system just report someone you don t like act dumb get them mad at you whatever then report their response to ea support takes up to 30 days to respond to ban appeals you probably can get away with it get their account suspended just because well you can i do not recommend buying any games that require origin to play you might not be able to play them again after saying ass in apex chat i may update this review next month if i can also get that guy banned for talking all that that nrg aimzz wraith you sure got me
