2023 december 18 update i have failed i have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while mw3 was 30 off december 6 update for mw3 season 1 so now warzone is disconnected from being standalone linked to mw2 and now accessible from the cod hq so no more application instance jumping for that dmz is still confused one place it says it s part of warzone the next is says it s part of mw2 but once you are in dmz the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to cod hq bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play mw2 which is completely unaceptable there no reason we can t have access to all within cod hq for mw3 wz dmz mw2 i ll still play it but i m not buying mw3 unless they bring foward a new raid and actual improvement to ui user experience original review the recent update bring a subpar ui to something even worse you are forced into mw3 cod hq before going anywhere even if you haven t bought it and which is no longer integrated with mw2 or warzone so if you select one or the other it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software want to switch from mw2 to warzone for some dmz or battle royale you have to go back to mw3 cod hq which means mw2 shutdown open mw3 shut down open warzone dmz when i tried to get out of dmz it didn t even go back to warzone instead doing the shutdown reopen cycle this is unaceptable and this is a step back
