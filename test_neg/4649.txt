2023 i would write a full review but i d rather not spend more time on this game than i already have anyways here s a list of fun facts 1 cod has fallen from grace 2 activision is a company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves 3 bobby kotick looks like the word burgundy and i d rather look at my own unshaven after i ve just taken a 4 they are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just call of duty for convenience purposes or whatever the hell but actually they re doing it so that way they can hide the mixed and negative reviews in later releases 5 all of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like 6 they really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with the boys but it was actually the most boring thing ever and they couldn t even get antony starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some z list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest 7 nicki minaj is a sex offender music sucks too 8 21 savage is a felon music sucks too 9 re releasing snoop dogg as another overpriced bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence buying it means you re stupid 10 infinity ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped they ll continue to lie to you until they pay for it 11 i ve had more fun writing this review than i have in the 362 hours i ve spent playing this game 12 i recently went back and played call of duty vanguard and had more fun playing that than i did this plus the ui didn t make me want to punch an infant 13 treyarch has been carrying this cod as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community it s true they are in charge of ranked play and have responded to the community more than activision has regarding their lawsuits 14 i am uninstalling this heaping pile of and if they actually make this the main hub for future cod titles including treyarch s next masterpiece they will never see my bank card again 15 this is the last fun fact just like this is the last time cod will ever reach over 80k players thanks for coming to my review i will leave comments open because unlike activision and infinity ward i like feedback
