2022 did you ever notice that when you look at a game on the steam store those strategy rpg action etc tags on the side are actually user defined did you know that clicking on the little plus allows you to add tags that you feel fit the game and the ones that are popular will be added to the list did you know one of those tags is early access given the state of the game on launch combined with the recent road map for even an attempt at fixing the state of the game i think it s only fair to call this an early access game and have added the tag myself what do you think
