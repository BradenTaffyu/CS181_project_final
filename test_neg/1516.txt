2023 i want to recommend this game i do i enjoyed wh2 a lot and have some fun moments in wh3 but there are just stupid problems in this game considering it is a direct successor to wh2 and design choices that are just not good there are still bugs in the game well over a year after release ranged units have a hard time firing at targets correctly armies can get stuck on agents and be frozen indefinitely random crashes can happen in battle maps several unit descriptions just don t even match what they actually do are functionally the ai are brain dead during sieges and i think the main settlement sieges are the worst in any total war game since empire the defender is actually worse off than the attacker with the new capture point system defenses don t work all that well walls are still worthless the ai can t defend their settlements for it is such an epic fail and makes sieges just a pain on both ends i hate them several of the older races empire dwarves dark elves especially just feel bland now in immortal empires the empires mechanics are terrible cathay isn t a finished race bretonnia needs attention realms of chaos is a bad campaign pure and simple it just isn t all that good id welcome arguments to the contrary but it wasn t well executed for the original characters on release and was insulting that they released wh3 with the game being unfinished immortal empires wasn t out yet and cathay wasn t finished and still doesn t feel finished the new chaos dwarves feel much more fleshed out than they do ca is half assing a lot of their content it is infuriating to see they are capable of doing a much better job and i cannot recommend any product from them in good faith while they keep putting out games dlcs and other updates that just aren t up to snuff unfinished unpolished untested and they expect us to accept it for what it is test it for them and wait for months to have proper changes by which point we ve moved on to the next paid title they ve released where they can take in more money
