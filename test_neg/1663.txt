2023 it s too expensive for them to properly fix it it s too expensive for me to rate this positive edit it seems like ca has finally started making some improvements and fixes to this game for example co op game was a constant slugfest with desync as it was randomly popping up however that is still not enough from the creators taking into account their rather controversial behaviour additionally the game still requires their attention ai on the campaing and battle is absurdly stupid right now until i see this game the way it should have been right from the get go i will leave this as negative long and steep way ahead of you ca
