2023 if you ve finished the dark souls series sekiro and elden ring and wanted more of the same in a different skin lies of p is fine it borrows mechanics from the aforementioned games but never innovates in any meaningful way to set it apart from them worse it often reverses qol changes made in recent fromsoft titles this would ve been mixed had steam allowed for the option the moment i decided on negative was when i realised that i wasn t having fun i was playing more out of obligation to satiate the stubborn masochistic souls elitist within me presentation storythe worldbuilding is fantastic and classic souls lore items are everywhere the music is phenomenal too however the lying theme doesn t go further than being a lame gimmick and there s a weird understanding of what it means to be human i e you need to be a lying murderous riddle solving music lover to be a real boy even in instances where lying is clearly the less human choice the plot contradicts itself and the game sequel baits with numerous loose ends engrisheither esl or ksl or both writing results in weird uncanny valley dialogue this is exacerbated by how the npc permanently attached to you has a horrible voice actor who sounds like an influencer promoting crappy mobile games tooltips are super unclear which makes buildcrafting a headache guess what this upgrade does enables dodging when on the ground answer lets you press the dodge button when knocked flat on the ground to get up quicker if your game has a western aesthetic and exclusively english voice acting maybe put a bit of effort into making sure the english isn t ass yeah you defeated is funny and iconic lie or die is just cringe mechanics explorationquests are straightforward i e when there are quests or special items at a location they will appear on the fast travel menu this is one of the few good innovations since i prefer to play the game instead of googling where the blaidd went level design is superb no illusory walls thank god loads of ambushes and deadly traps great tense feeling of clearing the way to the next bonfire shortcutthe reason i d rather rate this as mixed instead of negative is because of how well the maps are designed the people responsible for the maps did an excellent job at shortcut construction baiting with shiny chests various ambushes cannons shooting at you from afar groups of monsters charging at you and so on these situations test your ability to deal with a wide variety of scenarios and adequately punish you for not paying attention recent quality of life improvements the devs stripped away for some reason forced to return to the hub to level up can do so from the bonfire in ng respecs and physick flask equivalent require waiting for a stupid plant to grow and then harvesting said plant every hour or so you have to constantly fight the camera trying to auto center to the direction you re going in dodge on button release instead of press dodge buffering is hilariously long annoying runbacks to the boss stamina depletes even when out of combat the player character is worse at jumping than a paralysed 70 year oldgimped or overpowered upgrade system in sekiro upgrades enhance and build upon the base mechanics rewarding aggression and good play e g mikiri descending carp in lies of p you re either lacking basic mechanics in ng or ignoring core mechanics in ng there is no in between first there are many upgrades that should ve been part of the base kit such as being able to press dodge to get up after being knocked down this leads to portions of your first playthrough feeling gimped there are also qol upgrades like consuming less stamina when running which is necessary if you dislike annoying runbacks next later upgrades let you ignore game mechanics especially the few new ones not plagiarised from miyazaki dangerous red attacks you need to either perfect guard or outrange well with an upgrade you could just hold down block normally the boss being able to regenerate a portion of their hp if you don t attack them constantly encouraging aggressive play completely removed with a few upgrades combatif i call a soulslike a fromsoft ripoff because the player loses currency on death and there are bonfires that s not really fair however when a game so blatantly copies the smallest details of dark souls all the way down to poison swamps boss souls resin gestures no pausing the level up process and stats and even the menu layout it opens the door to comparison since they re riding on ds nostalgia i finally started ds1 after lies of p and the mechanic where your weapon dings off walls feels so much more natural in the 2011 game for some weapons e g holy sword of the ark this mechanic will drive you insane for others it s practically non existent new mechanics are uninteresting fury attacks attacks you need to either perfect guard or outrange are mediocre and a worse version of sekiro s perilous attacks staggering enemies for a fatal attack is an imitation of elden ring s poise but with an extra step that barely matters if you possess a modicum of patience breaking enemy weapons so they do less damage and have shorter reach is satisfying but ultimately useless it rewards players who ve perfect guarded a lot with something that doesn t matter to or actually hurts players who ve perfect guarded a lot since the shorter reach makes attacks harder to read repairing your weapon in the middle of a fight is bothersome because you re never chased down hard enough to be punished this is a worse version of finding openings to drink your estus fighting your eyes and instincts and having to memorise attacks one of the greatest things about sekiro is how rhythmic it feels it becomes a game of instincts once you ve mastered the mechanics and even the most comical of delayed attacks in elden ring make some sense in contrast lies of p necessitates memorising timings because of how poor visual clarity tells and hitboxes for many attacks are also sound cues are bad if not completely absent this wouldn t be as bad in a dodge focused game but there s a reason even the most cancerous sekiro boss fights have good tells the timing window for perfect guarding some attacks is way before the attack hits it s way after for others you have to memorise which is which some attacks seem natural and can be reacted to by instinct others are just the boss raising their arm one moment then teleporting the arm to your face the next you have to memorise which is which and timings for the latter some bosses can manipulate gravity and somehow delay a full body elbow drop by levitating in the air bosses can raise their weapons or even jump off screen at such an angle that it s impossible to see what s going on the game prioritises flashy animations over the player understanding what the boss is doing there is a 10 hit combo from a boss that visually appears like a 14 hit combo baiting players to try to perfect guard the fake hits overall the worst part of boss fights is how awful the risk reward ratio for perfect guarding is it is often better to dodge or outrange attacks which turns the entire game into a boring cakewalk final wordsif your favourite sekiro boss is blazing bull and if you think the runebear and giant crayfish i e lobster bro in elden ring are great fun then you ll probably like this game if you just had a negative visceral reaction to the things i listed stay far away or at least wait for a sale and go in with tempered expectations
