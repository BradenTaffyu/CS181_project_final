2016 update just moved nightmares to the pros nightmares is not having many issues anymore for some reason so i played it a bit more update 2 i finished the campaign last night i updated it s review below so i bought this game back in december i mainly wanted to play zombies and i liked it however let me break down the game a little caution a real review incoming pros good zombies mode shadows of evil is actually a very detailed map i like big city maps such as that unfortunately though unless you have the season pass or whatever that is the only map you can play on decent graphics it s not better looking than battlefront ea or rainbow six siege but it s actually alright for a cod game advanced warfare honestly looks better than this but then again this game uses the same engine like all the other cod s out there besides aw multiplayer is alright as well i haven t really had any connection issues or hit registration issues either everything seems quite stable for me in that regard i also haven t met a hacker once hell i ve been lucky not to meet any campers for once in a cod game not to mention exo abilities such as the jetpack are non existant except for sliding and boost jumping wall running is also a thing nightmares this idea i actually like i ve been waiting for a zombies campaign and now we got one somehow this mode is working better than before for some reason so i ll tell you what it basically is in a nutshell nightmares is pretty much the campaign levels but done with a different protagonist and done in a slightly different order with zombies splitscreen yes you heard me there s splitscreen co op campaign multiplayer zombies and nightmares not many devs nowadays actually give us local splitscreen in their games and of all the devs out there to do so it was a cod dev wut decent amount of graphical options you can change texture quality texture filtering mesh quality shadow quality dynamic shadows subsurface scattering volumetric lighting ambient occlusion anti aliasing and motion blur hell they even gave us a field of view slider as well as vsync fps limiter slider and pretty much almost every other video option that s in today s games cons my biggest gripe with this game right now is the performance the game doesn t perform as well as it should i sometimes have a hard time pulling a consistent fps at or above 60fps in campaign and nightmares even at high settings it still runs about the same the only sure fire way i could maintain a stable framerate sometimes at max settings in 1080p was by disabling volumetric lighting and order independant transparency completely however i actually like those effects since this game manages to make some decent use of godrays and lighting in certain areas of the maps but what can i do not to mention this game eats up way too much vram and ram for what this game presents us in the graphics department i can max out battlefront rainbow six siege and just about every other game in my library perfectly but not this game unless i turn off said effects i hope treyarch optimizes this game a little more however here s where this game gets weird in terms of optimization it s a hit or miss situation some people say that this game runs great for them some say it doesn t unfortuantely i am one of the people whom the game runs a bit poorly for me now unlike most people here who will simply say this game performs like a child trying to shove a square into a round hole and never post their specs i will if treyarch optimizes the game a bit more i will change this review to a positive case cooler master elite 430 gpu zotac geforce gtx 970 4gb no oc cpu amd fx 8350 8 core black edition no oc ram corsair vengeance 8gb disk drive samsung sh 224db bebe dvd cd writer cooling fan cooler master jetflo 95 0 cfm 120mm red psu xfx ts 550w 80 bronze certified atx power supply motherboard msi 970a g46 operating system windows 10 home 64 bit campaign isn t all that great ever since the start of the story i have no idea what the hell is even going on i only made it to the hypocenter level before i stopped i just couldn t understand what it was going for honestly one moment i m fighting a bunch of baddies in a run down terrorist controlled part of the city and the next minute i m suddenly in singapore fighting more baddies along with robots and mechs it doesn t help that the campaign runs terribly for me either but to add insult to injury i don t even know how this is a continuation of black ops 2 s story update now that i finished the campaign i have to say it s still not that great some sequences were pretty neat however it didn t even feel like a call of duty game towards the end it felt like it was trying to be something it was not at that point honestly i just couldn t feel it to be honest the whole dni mind control thing was dragging on way too long slight spoiler the only thing ever mentioned about black ops 2 so far was raul menendez but that conversation was very short lived also they mentioned and showed nova 6 from the first entry in the series during the last mission now granted i never finished the story yet but i just cannot bring myself to do so maybe when they fix some of the game s issues and whatnot i ll come back to it once more for now i d just skip it specialists i only really like 3 of em honestly ruin spectre and outrider the others aren t really as interesting but the whole specialist thing isn t really that great to me regardless to me i think it d be cooler if we could make our own mp character ya know or not make but perhaps build our own my final verdict thus far is still a 6 10 i will change this to a positive should treyarch fix up the game a bit i will still go on here from time to time to play a few matches of multiplayer and zombies i will update review as necessary i do wish there were a neutral or average option instead of a straight like or dislike i am excited for the modding tools as well but i hope that they deliver with that if not then i don t know honestly
