i can t deny that i love playing this game it s fun for me but the game has many shortcomings especially in terms of optimization i have larger games than once human but they run smoothly and perfectly without stuttering or glitches one thing i dislike about this game is the seasonal reset wipe every 6 weeks which has demotivated me my brothers and friends have also lost interest in investing in the game because of this today there was a new update patch and after downloading it and restarting the game my base was gone just like that there was no reason given and no notification whatsoever this already upset me imagine losing more things with a seasonal reset such as resources levels skills progress deviants collections items etc the in game shop uses usd as its currency which applies to all regions including mine making it very expensive for just one item therefore i ve decided not to spend any money on this game while the game does not require spending real money for progression only for cosmetics the costs are still too high for me to consider it worth it i don t understand why there are so many servers when most of them are empty and lack players yet the game still stutters or lags my internet and pc are good and work perfectly fine with other games this game however is poorly optimized i hope for better updates in the future especially regarding the seasonal reset better optimization the ability to skip the tutorial adding character slots so we don t have to create a new one every time we join another server adding more fish and upgrading the aquarium space as having one tiny fish in a large aquarium seems odd to me i will update my review if i find new things i like in the future for now sadly i do not recommend it however if you don t have a problem with any of the issues i ve mentioned then feel free to give it a try once human 6 usd 1 pc 1
