this game is incredibly fun and the amount of content is well worth its price however due to the community this game is nothing but a torture chamber say you want to get on with some of your friends cause ya like pirates or sailing the seas and making money so yall crew up and hop on before you even leave the starting island you re attacked so ya server hop attacked a few minutes after leaving port server hop ship sank this time by a cheater make an alliance they will betray you to make a fraction of the profit they would ve made if you sold it and shared the payment thats what alliances do the community is incredibly toxic most attack for no reason even when you clearly have not treasure aboard not to mention again that this game has a huge cheater problem and has had one for many years now rare doesnt care they even joked and made fun of players that wanted a pve only mode by making it where you cant progress while in that mode its just a sandbox basically absolute joke and spite from the devs at rare the only people who defend pvp in this game are the cheaters and scum whose only excuse is this is a pirate game if that were only so instead of this game being a cesspool of toxicity and cheaters i dont understand why they have all this pve content that you cant do because of the forced pvp its honestly worse than dark souls invasions after a long day of work i just want to explore the seas and progress my milestones but instead i m sunk by mrcoolswag69 named every slur in the book over the chat and told to kill myself and uninstall the game rare had such a good opportunity to make an amazing adventure game but fumbled it with forced pvp combined with the cheapest anticheat in the industry and bans anyone who speaks out against them or their vision of this game newsflash devs the players of your game know what they want if you did what we wanted youd have alot more sales and a higher player count the majority do not want forced pvp in this mainly pve game so be warned potential buyer you will not have fun or be able to relax in this game
