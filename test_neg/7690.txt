2023 still no anti cheat focusing on content instead of fixing the game servers are ass and got worse this season because of the larger player capacity hit reg doesnt work more than half of the time its just bad if you cant loose or tilt easily dont play it its not worth it if you dont have atleast one teammate same goes i have about 450 hours in this game because i played it over gamepass first but its not worth it and its not even getting better also rare doesnt listen to their playerbase
