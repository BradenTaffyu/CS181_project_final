2015 price jacked up for sale the port is good and i had thought they had redeemed themselves into the pc market since gta4 was a disaster but this cash grab is the last straw for me i d request a refund if i was eligible they can t keep on taking and taking from us and giving nothing in return we the consumer are being taken for granted we shouldn t be giving our hard earned money to developers like this if you really want to spend this sort of money on a game then chuck in another couple of quid and buy witcher 3 where the developer really does care about its consumer witcher 3 is worth every single penny
