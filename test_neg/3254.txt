2016 great game horrible company i ve been banned twice now the first time for tv remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane this is all me guessing the most plausible cause since you are given no reason and as per usual rockstar support refuses to be cooperative even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player submitting a support ticket even with evidence of your innocence results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket you should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game update after my 30 day ban ended i decided i would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban and i was entirely correct because after the entirety of one evening i wake up to be perma banned based on when i got the violation notice e mail it banned me when i was logging off when i still had a three star wanted level oddly enough my friend who did the exact same thing but has no bans on his record can still play the game amusing to say the least
