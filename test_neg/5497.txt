2016 i bought this game to play with my boyfriend who i live with we got to play for a few months perfectly fine we would play with some guys he met online and usually had a full team of 5 players and it was loads of fun sometimes even having 10 so we would do the custom 5 on 5 loved this game one nice sunny day we woke up early to play and took a break around lunch when we went back i just kept getting an error code ending in 48 if one of us is logged in the other can t play at all no situations terrorist hunt nothing we both opened case files with ubisoft support and did everything they asked us to do we did port forwarding called our isp traced packets and many other time consuming tasks one rep told youtoast my bf that we would need a second network i told this to my rep and he told me that was excessive just to play a game well today he told me that they honestly can t say why it was ever working before but not now that it is not unheard of for multiplayer games to have these issues when 2 users are connecting from the same network and that after investigating and looking through some things a second network will most likely fix the issue had i known this would happen i never would have purchased the game and season pass i will not be getting a second network just for this game when other multiplayer games let us play together just fine if you have siblings a spouse or roomates who you want to multiplayer with i would not recommend getting this game
