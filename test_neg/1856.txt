2022 as someone who has been a huge fan of the total war series since empire total war back in 2009 i have over 5000 hours of game play through the different games i feel like i have a good understanding of these games i have to say warhammer 3 has been a huge disappointment from the start very limited amount of factions to play if you re only playing the wh3 campaign very limited set of units for each factions with most factions only have 2 units of renown main story isn t too bad but after doing it 3 4 times it gets very repetitive as theres isn t many ways to complete the campaign and some factions are absolutely terrible compared to the others legion of chaos is one all units you get are weak versions of the actual factions worshipping a single chaos god the main campaign also have some game breaking bugs that just make the game not fun to play as example my buddy got one of his settlements attacked drops in to the battle and the ogres that are attacking him bug at the entrance of the settlement and sit there till they re dead giving him free wins when it clearly shouldn t some battles the players has clearly the stronger army lord and heroes but when you attack it says something along the lines of valiant defeat when you know for a fact that the iron dragon of cathay is supposed to eat up nurglings like his morning cereal but you re then forced to waste 5 10 minutes of your time to do a drop in battle that was completely unnecessary to begin with you can select units and send them somewhere but for some reason they stand still even after selecting and trying to move them 5 times for the immortal empire i am aware that they re still working on it and it will get better but with the last patch its only made things worst they removed minor settlement siege battles cause apparently people live in the trees now instead of buildings and for some reason they re constantly making the terrain a hill for my opponents as for large settlements the tower placements are terrible often being behind tall buildings or walls so the tower shots never connect they constantly hit everything but the intended targets wall get taken down by peasants with swords or spears towers get murdered by tier 1 harpies that literally lose to everything else your units will also break moral in the stupidest way running while being 80 90 hp and into the enemy units instead of running away and for no reason even if you re sitting with 14 healthy units with a lord and heroes still being present i could keep ranting amount all the other issues i ve found but it would taken way too much time anyway all this to say total war warhammer 3 is an incomplete game with an industrial amount of balancing and bug fixing until it becomes fun and worth while to play and currently the only fun part of the game is the immortal empire that doesn t even allow players to select other races apart from the wh3 if they don t own all 3 warhammer games example buddy of mine has wh3 and wh2 with all dlcs but the game won t let him choose a wh2 faction even though he already owns the content of it he was forced to buy wh1 to be able to access the other factions that he s already paid for i will not be returning to wh3 until the game has been worked on some more and even then i ll probably have to pay more to get the additional content that we were supposed to have to begin with so i may refund the game and stick to wh2 i don t know anymore thank you for taking the time to read my rant and feel free to let me know what you guys think
