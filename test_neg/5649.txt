2018 rainbow six siege operation censorshipin a game where you literally break the geneva conventions by killing defenseless injured soldiers murdering hostages props to you fuze and myself from time to time the greates concern you have is hate speech or insulting language which the dev team uses as an excuse to ban people jesus even tachanka screams bljaaaaaat sometimes when hit even the lord himself does it so why shouldn t we as his followers step into his footprints but seriously this game is for gamers which are at least 18 except if mom bought you this game for your birthday i got banned for making a typo for the word frag i forgot the r and got banned for 30 minutes great job ubisoft to not lose me and a lot of people as your costumers and by allowing free speech just introduce a chat mute chat ban option if someone feels annoyed by the language of another player it s that simple but no social justice warriors love to ban free speech altough i really love this game but just please stop banning people for insulting each other if they are allowed to kill each other in the game anyway just adds a bit of realism
