2021 i would like to start by saying if you decide to buy this game please do not play the multiplayer single player fun engaging story with diverse gameplay and story missions it is entertaining even on multiple playthroughs now let s begin the that is multiplayer the community is toxic the updates turned multiplayer from fun with friends to oh a guy who spent money on shark cards glitched modded grinded for hundreds of hours has a network of sattelites that can abolish me at any point the issue isn t with how they implemented the multiplayer but with how it is run it s purely money driven you either grind your entire life mod cheat glitch or fall behind they added a bunch of futuristic that couldn t be part of the canon even in a halo game there s a bike that hovers has rocket engines and can shoot homing missiles at you the writing for the heists makes no sense your money is constantly being drained from your savings from bills for garages houses etc the value of items is insane if you check how they price their shark cards a golden plane can not be worth 70 100usd there are a lot of other issues but that covers the majority please stop playing online let it die force them to make gta 6 do not play the multiplayer let them know that people that we have moved on force them to make a new game
