2021 after playing a few hundred hours of dead by daylight and having this game for a year or so the game seems to excel in one particular area manufacturing discontent part 1 aesthetic from the seasonal skins in which you can view the paid versions provide much more aesthetic than the free as much of the free items as of lately have just been colored blocks with a simple symbol on them called charms the characters all seem to walk the same way now as their individuality that was originally intended as story elements has now been stripped for more of what i assume ease of programming however the characters have a real strangeness to them they all walk the same way and are designed to only be aesthetic changes but the game is built around stealth so an aesthetic change can wildly change your survivability and thus we have reached an odd crux of an issue how do you make a fair game when aesthetic is a stat either you have a pay to play or you have no such thing as variability between players certain characters cheryl and ace are less loud in their injuries than others making a main perk of the game called iron will basically built into those players those players are either obtained through grinding or payment the new killer wildly breaks the aesthetic of grimy killers which the game was known for and has mechanics similar to that of one of the already established killers the huntress as such the incorporation of such a killer can only be thought of to be some new aesthetic an aesthetic that breaks the game as every map in the game is known for its dull colors dead by daylight largely has a color of mud which is alright as it provides a spooky atmosphere the killers borrow this muddy aesthetic such as ghostface oni leatherface having dull color palettes the problem with the new killer the trickster is that he clearly does not fit into a swamp or an abandoned farm and the color palette and aesthetic that was chosen for him doesn t mesh it is clear he isn t intended for the maps or the game that was built but thrown into it to increase sales as such the horror associated with him is more of how awkwardly this man is forced to live in this game it is clear that the developers of the game are willing to bend whatever law they can make to build a profit from incorporating any horror theme that they can to introduce more new revenue this can be seen from the awkward transition of a city night life into the aesthetic of a rural campfire part 2 gameplay their seems to be a lack of new maps being added as the developers have found that retouching a map can make the game seem fresh enough to entice a player base back however this includes patching issues that should have never stayed for as long as they have such as but not limited to maps that have had rocks that lock your character in place if you hug a rock and seeing as a main portion of this game is stealth survival you will likely be hugging rocks lockers that you cannot pull a survivor out of which is a main mechanic of capturing them if you are a killer odd hitboxes that do not match up with character models in order to make the game even the rewards system hinges around survivability which often creates a strange passive aggressive nature to the game if the killer chooses to only chase you you will die and you will lose progress on your ranking as the killer is stronger than any one survivor that is if the killer only chases one person if you play alone the lack of communication between your teammates is bound to make this happen this is because the lack of coordination often means that the killer will not be punished for this play style as the main mechanic to punish this is to make sure that your teammates are progressing objectives if they do not know where the killer is or what the killer is up to other than they can occasionally know the killer is near them it is a lot more likely that they will be very inefficient at doing to the objectives now if the survivors are good then there are only a few times that you can save other survivors from the hook which is one of the fastest ways to get benevolent points and rank up you might not ever get into a chase due to the sunk cost of the killer having to tunnel one injured survivor when playing as the killer the survivors have lots of mechanics to be annoying stunning you in various manners and running away and it is in the manner of getting chased by being annoying that you gain points playing as a killer the only relief you get is knowing that the annoying survivors are dead due to the first person viewpoint of the killer almost all killers maneuver their attack ability in a straight line huntress trickster demigorgon lunge twins baby lunge deathslinger hillbilly nurse blink this means that as a survivor any ability the killer uses can be dodged by just veering from the straight line that the ability is used on while this can be compensated for as a killer in predicting the movements of a survivor this generally means that all survivor killer mechanics work essentially the same and as more killers come out the overlap will only get larger playing as a survivor your goal is to sabotage your teammates in order to gain more ranking which is built off of the premise that a good killer should be stronger than any one survivor and a good survivor should be in chases saving people and doing objectives such as gens putting those together someone from your group is naturally dying to further your game they have also reworked many of the abilities slightly for the same cause however that opens a new problem this game only has about 10 15 viable perks or abilities your character can choose between entering they have recently reworked a few perks to carry the same mechanics of other perks because the game is out of ideas but knows it needs to change something in order to make people come back part 3 itemsitems have a weird place in whether they are considered essential gameplay elements or not most killer sided items can change the game dramatically keys and previously mori s shortcut large portions of the game medkits and flashlights can prevent killer kills somewhat easily there are perks that make more survivor items and perks that killers can use to get rid of items however if items are essential then players should not have to grind to get certain items if they are not essential then the incorporation of them like toolboxes currently is pointless part 4 tldr conclusiondead by daylight was innovative when it came out but it s strive to consume all markets it has lost a identity and in that loss it has become an ever increasing empty husk of its former self continuously promising to improve and promote in hopes to keep the former market that believed in it it was never meant to be this big and the design limits that are inherent in its premise will only be magnified by the addition of future content while map tweaks and hitboxes can improve the game a somehow fair balance between survivor which and killer perks which are inherently lopsided due to the fact the player base has to be largely survivors for matches to be found 4 survivors to 1 killer and balancing matchmaking between survive with friends who communicate and someone who queues up solo is a nightmare can theoretically make the game better it is built to not be fun but around competing and competing against something that is stronger than any one of the survivors means that your gameplay is not based on much skill but the skill of killing off your allies before you which you will likely escape so if you are killer it is largely built off of not being able to accomplish killing all of the team either way it is not satisfying
