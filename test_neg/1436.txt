2022 let s be real for a second this game without any dlc or predecessors is not even half a total war game and the price you are asked to pay for the full experience is only stomachable if you bought the other stuff you want in it over the last years the balancing is all over the place since ca ramped up the magic from i to ii to iii considerably and throws in elite units like it s going out of style once you ve met a half dead chaos army that still kicks ass because every single unit is a super elite unit you ll know what i mean the difficulty setting essentially just beefs up the ai units to ridiculous levels and reduces their upkeep so a faction a tenth your size may field as many armies as you have legendary lords may have the most special of special effects or a minor economy buff so if you meet one in battle be prepared for nasty surprises even just on hard difficulty i ve seen the ai attacking me getting killed to the last zombie sylvania and both attacking armies were back to full strength with the lords i just put in the ground there may be some around endgame scenarios follow the old ca route just throw a ton of elite fullstacks at the player because that s fun idk if it were an actual horde attack but the spawning of for example 15 stacks of elite wood elves who just go on the rampage until you burn their stupid forest is plainly creativly bankrupt the design of minor villages is moronic in the extreme and mostly doesn t benefit the defender nearly as much as it should in the case of dwarfs humans and elfs who may have things like firing lanes and defensive positions in mind there are for example often courts which might concentrate the enemy by blocking off the exits but you can t put any ranged units in good firing positions around it sieges are still as stupid as they were in twwhi everybody has a ladder up his arse and walls are little more than death traps for your troops knocking down reenforced gates with clubs and fists takes about as much time as it takes a unit to leave the wall i m not saying i m not having some fun in this game but it could be much better especially since it s the third and final entry in the series so if you liked the other two twwhs and have all the dlc races you might want to play go ahead and buy it but if you are new to the whole twwh go get something else this game will annoy the hell outta you
