2022 as someone that really really enjoys the feeling of sailing through this vast open world scavenging and learning about the stories it has to offer i just can t in good conscience recommend this game to anyone yes it came out on a deplorable state but even after all these years the game still keeps a major flaw that nullifies every single enjoyment you can get out of the game the pvpve system there s quite a wide gap between the idea of you can get into conflict at any moment and the way it s executed through gameplay there s more to gain from being an and assaulting a ship than not doing it and that s the problem the game has a plethora of pve content and stories that involve moving pretty much across the whole map so the chances of finding at least one player are pretty high now do you think they will just let you be or will they try to sink you simply cause they can 9 out of 10 times it will be the later the enemy ship most likely doesn t care that you don t have anything even if there s no point in killing you they will do it simply cause there s nothing telling them they can t do it the developer s vision of this game actively lets everyone and anyone engage in combat even if one of the parties doesn t agree or doesn t want to ever engage and lemme tell you absolutely do not come to this game expecting either a fun pvp experience or a rewarding pve experience both of them suck fighting and shooting is not satisfying in a any way and pve gets ruined the moment someone wants to fight you until the edge of the map so where does it leave the playerbase the majority doing pvp are straight up looking to ruin everyone else s fun and the people doing pve are new beginners trying the game out or getting the hang of it by doing whatever pve mission they can and hoping someone doesn t gank them for no reason but this is a pirate s game pirate s are supposed to fight and steal some people say this is also a blatant stupidity based on media over the decades portraying pirates as nothing more than heartless thieves pirates had a code alliances and rarely fought each other but hey if a few movies say they re always bad i guess it must be true until the day sea of thieves gets a toggle for pvp or pve servers this is not an enjoyable experience for anyone except streamers looking to get reaction videos nothing more
