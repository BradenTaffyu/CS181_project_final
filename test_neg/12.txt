not recommended for solo players just a disclaimer i like the game i played space marine 1 when it came out i palyed all dow games darktide and this is just another cool and very immersive creation when it comes to showing the w40k universe but i hesitate to say it but it feels like the developers love souls games a typical fight as a bulwark sword and shield character starts with a mighty swing and then i have to dodge parry dodge dodge dodge parry dodge dodge dodge parry dodge dodge dodge parry dodge dodge dodge and a few more parries in between because otherwise one of the ten thousand enemies swarming you will ripp away your armor in 3 hits and then you get twoshottet because your healthbar is just there for looks in sm1 you were able to replenish your health with finishers i don t know why they got rid of this but it makes the entire game even harder and more frustrating what also increases your difficulty as a solo player 1 the bot teammates are outfitted with a horrible ai they revive you yes but other than that they don t serve a real purpose they don t attack important targets they don t capture or play objectives they don t defend mission objectives and they don t execute important targets until the very last second of them beeing immobilized 2 every enemy is targeting you and only you maybe one or two are going after your bot teammates but the other 9998 are going after you and that s not exaggerated i stood behind my two bot teammates and the ranged enemies on the opposite side ignored them completely and were shooting at me ignoring the threat right in front of them 3 animation lock this is really the most annoying if you use a powerful melee attack and see a red circle popping up which indicates a non parryable enemy attack you can t dodge because you are still stuck in the attack animation this results in the loss of at least one of three armor bars and if they are already gone at least half your health bar on the lowest difficulty i might add same goes for other animations if you dodge one attack while another enemy signals an attack of any kind you can t react because you are stuck in a dodge roll or a jump and will likely get hit by said enemy who then might throw you on the ground or stagger you which also comes with its own animation in which you are also locked and i think you can see where i m getting with this at some point you are just button smashing to somehow get out of this especially frustrating during a boss fight were you have to time your parries and then minions show up which are not getting attacked by your stupid bot ai teammates 4 enemies even small ones can stagger or push you away mid melee combo and then you are animation locked until you re back on your feet this is a huge problem in a horde shooter were you are getting attacked constantly and relentlessly and can t fight back because then you will get staggered and loose all your health in the process see point 35 the pve operations are waaayyy too long and have too many traversing areas it takes roughly 20 minutes per operation with a decent squad but solo i just wasted 45 minutes on operation 3 because of the aforementioned problems 10 of those fighting 2 zoanthropes with no ammo because you and my npc teammates not shooting them because them i managed to take one down with a melta bomb lying around and then the second one was eventually staggered by my bot teammates 6 hipfiring your guns means missing 90 of the time which genius came up with that idea aiming down sights increases the accuracy but apparently squishy marines are using nerf guns all of a sudden 7 my power sowrd needs 3 to 4 full attack combos to stagger a tyranid warrior in diffciulty level 3 who tested this who said great let s ship it so i have the feeling that this game is balanced around co op playing which is nice but if you are a solo player and you don t like soulslike games then this will frustrate you more than it will bring you joy and if you liked elden ring just imagine the godskin duo fight around every corner with multiple godskin duos why does every other game nowadays tries to be another elden ring the combat system in sm1 was solid not perfect by any means but solid why this parry and dodge fest looking at the progression system and that you have to play higher difficulty ranks at some point because otherwise you can t level up your weapons while faceing the abovementioned hurdles already on the lowest tier doesn t help my motivation and i am very happy that i only bought the base game so tl drgreat game with friends can t recommend for solo players especially casual ones if you only want it for the campaign wait til it goes on sale addition after 30 hours i am now a bullwark lvl 16 so i should be able to complete difficulty level 3 recommended level 10 but i can t i managed to get to the boss in operation 2 but then died to adds which are swarming me without having a chance to fight them off while the boss chain red attacked and my bot teammates did nothing i mean literally nothing whoever playtested this i hope he gets diarrhea short arms and no toilet paper i also can t upgrade my weapons further because the armor data i need to do that are only availabble in tier 3 but but buuuuuut just play with oddar whoomanss oh i tried my brain missing friend but somehow matchmaking doesn t give me teammates either because everyone already stopped playing or nobody wants to play randomly above tier 2 because holy horus the combat system is so horrible blocking and dodging pressing the execute button a dozen times during one trashpack and endless spawning enemies are sooo nineteen eighties i know i was there
