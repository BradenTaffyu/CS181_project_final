2016 devs have been saying since before the beta ended party with friends is on it s way but will not release a date for when or a test version of it to let people start trying it to allow them to see what needs tweeking people constantly lobby hop looking to play with their friends and the devs solution is to try and hurt people wanting to enjoy a game they bought to play together by not allowing them to join lobbies for set periods of time after leaving this issue would be bigger if the game would actually connect you to lobbies when you clicked find a game most of the time it will fail to find a lobby and take you a good 10 min or so to get into one where the killer leaves if they see someone with items they don t like or a high level rank gets into the lobby then you restart this process if you ever take a look at the forums you will find one of the most toxic communities both sides trying to rip out the others throat because killers want to be gods who can kill the entire team without trying otherwise survivors are to op because they can escape and survivors want balance but aren t allowed to have it because a few people abuse it i f your looking to buy i d suggest waiting 6 months and seeing if this toxic community is still around or if the game destroys itself
