with the reveal of bo6 not transferring skins from this game i am just done voting with my wallet this time it s the same thing over and over again we preach to them about wanting to retain stuff we ve earned from previous titles i couldn t give a about a nicki minaj skin or whatever but i am damn proud of the zombie skin i earned from hours and hours of grinding solo this just won t make a difference and i understand that the cod community is filled with arrogant players that just want to play the newest cod nothing has changed over the years the graphics look the same the gameplay is mostly the same please reread that mostly the gunplay is the same every single year we buy this up the cod community has to do better i have no idea how you have a community that the most about this yet doesn t do anything
