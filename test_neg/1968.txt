this games amazing and really fun its really quality and exciting for a free to playit has possibly the best character creation ever and just overall fun mechanics all around the deviants and enemies are all extremely flavorful and fun the story is well made and theres so many features that are just peak gaming the weapons and the gacha is really great too and theres not even a pay to win feature its nearly perfect i legit cannot gripe about anything about this game except for two or so things and those are seasonal wipes and your character gaining weight for keeping good stats as in hunger and thirst i heard that every season your level and many other things wipe and theres this weird transfer system in place to like bring bare minimum stuff or something idk but every season you lose all levels and everything else and like for me and many other players seasonal wiping is a hardcore deal breaker the other qualm i have is the dumb weight gain system i eat healthy so my character can have max stamina and hp and in return my character gets fat it would be better if the game had a flat weight from your character creation and only change via character creation ticketseither way if not for the wipes and the fattify thing id say this game is perfect and before i found these things out i was really planning on being a super long term player and even invest into this game but now nahi mean whats the point of doing all that crap if im just gonna have to do it again and why bother making my character if i have to make them again every season wipe and why bother keeping good health if its gonna make me fat and no longer be agile as i built myself why do i have to wait so many days to gain access to a section of the game in parts of each season if its all gonna be reset anyways so cringe its a shame such an amazing game is sullied by such featuresand the fact the beta testers never said anything about this until the game released doesnt help at all me and my pack of friends were hyped on this but the moment we found out theres seasonal resets all of our motivation went right out the door such a shame that this game does that i mean it doesnt even have non wiping servers when i play a progression based game the last thing i want is my work to be thrown out without me having a say in itsooooo yeah if not for the seasonal wipe and fatification id give this game a perfect score on the games score hell id say it would be worthy of being a paid game or even a subscription bonus notes they stated in a post on the games news page on steam that they may add permanent servers in the future and i do hope thats the case rather soon and if it does happen i will happily change my review i still wish the weight gain wasnt there thoupdate tried losing weight in the game to keep my super fragile appearance i had bodywise on my male and it all just shot down to 0 and now im a walking twig i had to use a item for character re customization to restore my form
