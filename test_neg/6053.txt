2018 i have over 500 hours in this game so obviously i enjoyed it at one point this used to be my favorite game and i would play it for several hours every day but now it s a honestly such a terrible game and is only getting worse and let me tell you why the game is centered around the idea of a killer and 4 survivors with the killer in the dominant role there are various killers to choose from that all have cool unique abilities but the problem is that the killer is no longer the dominant role making the survivors both the group and the dominant role it started out correctly it was buggy but it was done right with the killers actually being scary as of now there have been so many survivor buffs and killer nerfs that playing killer is a joke and isn t fun anymore being a killer main i have personally experienced this gradual degression into nothingness that the developers of the game have enforced the other main problem is that the developers are the most disconnected people that i have ever seen completely ingoring the blatently obvious problems that there game has they focus gameplay around lower level survivors which means more experienced players are almost impossible to kill the killer nerfs have gotten so bad that even the survivor side of the community is complaining and that s saying something usually the survivors are pretty toxic so for them to recognize a problem on the killer end of things should have been a wake up call to the developers but to no avail to end this i would like to quote one of the developers who was asked the question do you have any ideas on how you are going to impove the killer experience this was responded to with maybe try survivor for a bit or play something else for like a week try civilization or something this was literally a developer saying that they aren t going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has i hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game but for now please avoid it for your own sake
