i m a reviewer who got an early copy of this game i was extremely impressed with it and it was reflected in my written review however putting microtransactions into a 70 game after launch and after the reviews have come out is an extremely anti consumer move so i just leave this negative review here to show how disappointed i m in you capcom not to mention your horrendous optimization
