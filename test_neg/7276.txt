baffling decisions really hard to understand japanese developers standpoint disgusting performance only 1 save file and not allowing for a new game with different character you cannot even delete the file since it is stored on the server end mtx and dlcs are implemented in the first minute in a single player game you need to pay to change your character s appearance or need to play the game to accumulate some sort of currrency which will take time archaic technicality dlss looks incredibly blurry dlss3 got delayed dldsr options are not supported game seems very promising but could not focus to play due to performance problems mind you this is coming from a user with rtx4090 and i9 13900k will change when they have fixed the game but not worth the first day hype if you are stamping that 70 tag to your game you need to honor it
