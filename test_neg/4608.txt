2022 this game is a blast i ll start there and very addicting too i ll probably keep playing after this review but if you can avoid getting into it i would the developers seem like they don t know what they re doing as game developers like they re feeling their way through it and just faking it until they make it they listen to the big streamers and no one else they keep flip flopping back and forth on what weapons they want us using and which ones they don t the recent changes they made with ammo made every weapon suck it makes you have to spend longer in game looking for ammo now or just use your glaive to nuke it as a working class person who works 40 hour a week i m already at my max amount if time i can spend on this game if you make me look for ammo and slow me down i can t get as much accomplished during my daily session and just lose interest after that every single update they release completely breaks the game and it never gets fully fixed before the next game breaking update is released my buddy gets stuck as a stick figure model moving around a level but not being able to shoot his gun we all get the bug where you can t open the escape menu to do anything and when that happens you can t do anything else but to alt f4 and hope you didn t just lose the last hour of grinding you did and half of the time you do these are just two examples of many i could go on for hours if i made a list of what all is broken that s surprising for a game that came out in 2013 they need to put out tests of these updates before pushing them on everyone this isn t working and it s making me regret the last few times i ve used a plat coupon to purchase platinum and then traded for stuff in game that they decide the next week to nerf or change
