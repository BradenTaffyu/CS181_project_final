tldr it was fun for a time i m not recommending it because of the wipe mechanic yes i read what you keep and what you don t it s still a wipe you still lose stuff now there s nerfs for pve because pvp and lootboxes so i m done till they add private servers or a single player option there is a soft wipe they move everything to eternaland and then you can pick a choose some things to bring into the next scenario and reset you back to level one when you move to next scenario you keep blueprints mods weapon accessories cosmetics the special currencies a lot of people still want to keep all their stuff and just jump into the scenario but so far it seems the devs are very against that and keep pushing the eternaland stuff pvp wipes make sense pve wipes are just a waste of time i still continued to play hoping there d be a change and now there s some ranching in the game and you ll lose those animals too so what s the point i haven t done combat since the new august 15th patch but reading the patch notes they ve nerfed some things and seems mainly to balance pvp but that affects pve too which is a majority of the playerbase so imagine spending weeks of earned starchrom currency to have your build nerfed the last bit of the scenario because of a part of the game that you don t even participate in lootboxes they are cosmetic only however i find lootboxes in any games predatory it s gambling it s rng people are getting duplicates all the time and you can only open 150 boxes so people can spend all that money a box is 150 premium currency and still not get the fancy skin bike just put the items directly in the shop
