i m not leaving a negative review for the poor debut performance or the micro transactions but the replayability the original dragon s dogma is easily one of my top five favorite games of all time but this one doesn t really make the cut due to how bland ng is and how it ultimately kills the replayability of the game in fact the lack of any ng mode that s any more than an afterthought is exactly what i think will make this game quietly die out in the next 3 or 4 months and that really disappoints me when you start a new game after beating it that s all it is a new game there is no added difficulty there are no enhanced or additional mobs there is no ur dragon with competitive damage rankings and rewards for defeating it as a community you simply go about a new playthrough with your old gear and level sure you might get the most mileage doing one more run to complete some sidequests you might have missed or pick up some secret chest items you didn t find that will be useless because you re already juiced up but ultimately ng is currently pointless and really disappointing there s no hardcore or time trial runs either the games ending in general really screams we didn t meet deadlines and had to cut stuff again and it s really unfortunate because the first dd suffered a similar fate
