2021 with the hours i have 111 on pc and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms i can t recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i ll list my reasons the game is far from what it was 2017 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don t get me wrong its funny as all in casual or when you re just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit you ll meet good people trust me i ve met friends and still talk to them to this day i m going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn t a problem here i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the mnk problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can t even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just oh we don t condone it please don t do it but what does that achieve nothing and it ll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don t want to cheat or they ll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn t even mimic mouse movement correctly i ll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you you this isn t cod don t treat it like it and let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for i ve made amazing memories with this game with 1v5 and aces i don t write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we ll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity edit siege got worse and ubisofts game design is worser
