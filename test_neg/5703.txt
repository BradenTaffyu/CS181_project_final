2016 alright i played enough of this game to make a decent review of it tldr get it dirt cheap and don t bother with their ranked system try to get friends to play it i m currently in queue for a ranked game and it s been 14 minutes it must also be the amount of time they spent coding it there s 3 way to play this game pvp casual pvp ranked and pve pve terrorist hunt is fun with friends but gets really boring after a while that s my opinion some people really dig it but i don t anymore i ll now talk about the pvpi played a total of 9 games today 3 of them were 3v5 2 of them were with trolls that killed us and got instakick by the game too bad ewplay doesn t give you substitute for them so i played 1v5 for 2 rounds the game then went for a 3v5 1 with 2 of my premades the other 3 went well edit the game i was in queue for was a 3v4 i used to play casual and lot and wanted to experience the ranked system turns out it s pure played my game through the unranked to bronze 2 1 with almost the same type of games as mentioned above i got demoted 5 times in those 10 games so the pros the graphics are nice the gameplay is fun strategy and communications are great too bad people won t use it the cons you have to farm the characters or buy them top value for the money you paid customization through in game shop with an excessive amount of farming or money once again used to have a lot of hackers ranked system sucks super hard you ll play with and against the same guys over and over and over again for instance right now i cancelled my queue a good 10 times just to be matched again with the same guys that trolled our team the previous game there s no afk kick the netcode will kill you and it must be the only game ever where lagging gives you an advantage you can see people through walls sometimes long queues no single player ewplay no point buying season pass it s a scam the casual mode is the same as ranked although i find ranked more challenging they also make no sense at all so i ll still play the game but i m glad overwatch is coming out later today rainbow six rogue spear used to be my favorite fps and one of my first one i d like to thank you ubisoft for destroying everything you touch
