2015 the campaign is a chaotic mess the main characters are uninteresting i even forget all their names i didnt get any sentimental conection to my own main character or my team buddies when doing the missions i have no clue why im even doing it you get trown around making you confused as heck it felt uninspiring and very boring if your buying this for solely multiplayer then your set its solid but nothing realy inovative there alot of fps games out there even older ones that provide even more modes and even vehicles i havnt tried zombies yet i havent encounter any mayor bugs or hiccups like most people it runs fine on my pc however the character blend to much with the enviroment making it realy hard to spot people but as it stands now i wouldnt recommend this game
