2021 i am in a weird relationship with this game it is unique it is fun and it has a good basic gameplay formula so why am i recommending against getting this game it is the developers they have proven time and again how disconnected they are from the issues plaguing the game between rushed updates that lead to several gamebreaking bugs very poor optimization on the maps and the blatant ignorance that they have displayed towards the balance of the game and the content creators who are willing to criticize them getting banned from any of their forums or streams more often than not make the game not fun and makes me not willing to support them the devs also don t put in effort to understand why something might be a problem they only look at the statistics which isn t always accurate as an example there is currently a survivor perk skills you can load on your character to assist in your or your teams survival or objective completion that lets the survivor see the killer s position and in a strong survive with friends group that can completely shut down killers and their potential mindgames at loops the devs only look at the survival rates of the survivor running this perk and say it s balanced because the statistics say the survivor only has a 50 survival rate the other major issue i have with the game is the microtransactions at the time of writing this if you were to buy only the base game and nothing else you have a selection of 3 killers to play and 4 survivors if you were to unlock other survivors killers by buying their dlcs directly from steam you are looking at spending something around 145 just to unlock the game s full gameplay this does not include the cosmetics which cost anywhere from 5 to 15 for a single item you do have the option of unlocking most killers and survivors licensed killers and survivors like demogorgon and michael myers can t be earned for free for free by earning a special currency by playing the game the major issue with this is that to earn enough currency to buy a single killer or survivor it takes somewhere around 65 70 hours of nonstop playing to earn enough currency i really want to recommend this game and if the developers pull their heads out of their a es and actually try to understand what is wrong with the game rather than just looking at flat statistics and proceed to fix it instead of trying to pump out as many cosmetics and new dlcs as possible to milk as much money as they can i would change my recommendation as it is i would say to wait or find a different game i am also writing this after having not played to see if i would come back to it and ultimately no i have no desire to return to this game in it s current state
