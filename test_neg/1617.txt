2022 q3 for mortal empires map okay you guys deserve all the poor ratings you get if it was that far out why was this released so soon oh right your stock holders the real people you make games for ultimately the game has alot of potential because it basically offers some qol improvements to the ui but that s about the only positive things i have to say here beyond the cool factor of the new factions the mechanics of said new factions are fairly unrefined for example cathy s ying yang system which adds bonuses when they re balanced adding points to each based upon building setup which is horribly tedious and irritating to say the least if you re expanding rapidly for example it becomes annoying when you want to maximize it i haven t been on the game since it has been a very janky experience since its initial launch regretting my purchase as i should ve waited for them to fix this mess i could ve forgiven all of this if they released the large map for me and a friend i was very excited to spend time with on here and well q3 so i bought her and myself the game just to wait ca is known to fix issues at a snail s pace this game s predecessor it took months sometimes to fix bugs and the ai has been rife with problems on this and its previous game this game though is especially bad with ai on that note the ai pathing for moving through city fights is outright broken with them somewhat fixing it i think not too long ago don t get this game until end of this year at earliest you ve been warned a real shame update 9 4 immortal empires is in rough shape constant crashes awful pathing for units questionable balancing on confederation among other things and turns taking forever to go through at times due to huge slowdown of turn end means the experience is just not there ca has had all this time and its in this state if they want a good review from me the issues better be fixed sooner than later oh and ps their hotfixes to respond to even crashes for example the crashes due to not accepting a threat to pay off a hostile faction has been there for weeks now well done ca you guys can t even support the game well despite raking in this much money update 10 8 stability fixes and core problems remain mostly unfixed seems we ll get some critical fixes once per month as said earlier do not buy unless on discount ca does not deserve 60 usd for this mess especially with the money time and experience they have across this trilogy of games alone update 2 28 2023 the latest update has caused the game to be entirely unplayable crashing my game in the initial load in for any game regardless if its a save or a new one this has been reported by many people across the technical forum as well and its amazing how the latest patch was allowed in to cause such a major issue ca as usual shows just how incompetent they are
