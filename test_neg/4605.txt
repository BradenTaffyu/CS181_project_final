2017 i tend to write essays especially on things i am against so brace yourself warframe started as a game with potential from developers who were about to bankrupt now several years after they are huge company having sheetload of attention and money too much of money warframe is now a moneymaker with stupid policy and strict rules that will get you banned on chat for saying something that is not politically correct policy according to which you don t own your account they rent it to you do something they don t like get banned with no reason given they can do it and they do now let s go to the game itself it is different than other games i played to be honest i haven t heard of anything similar to it except destiny nice concept of the gameplay at least for me metric fckton of weapons and stuff to unlock buy and customize some creative story pushed on the side because they can t link it to multiplayer game style story is player character focused already feels weird that is what in my opinion holds it together keeps playerbase big but suffers from the broken mechanics and idiotic decisions weapons and warframes are extremely unbalanced only a bunch of them makes it to meta when they finally get to rework some op weapon or game breaking new warframe they nerf it to the hell weak weapons almost never get a boost and when they get it s something that makes them mediocre still nothing to compare to that shiny tigris prime weak warframes just get called sheet and abandoned by everyone they are reworked when it s time to release new prime access again money money money and it s either a buff making frame so broken that everyone knows it will get nerfed soon or a useless change that won t make the situation any better the main problem through is insane grind in order to get high mastery rank that will let you grind even more weapons and get better in other players eyes this mechanic is addicting and not fun at all on top of that with every update they only add even more grind including new resources that are required for incoming content which are harder and harder to get it s getting to the point where a new player will literally have to spend hundreds of hours in order to play a mission with some friends who have already spent hundreds of hours getting to it there is one more thing maximum rank in the game is 30 there are steam achivements but you aren t even able to get it yet maximum possible rank to get is 24 6 sep 2017 with all existing weapons warframes archwings sentinels and pets maxed out including prime wraith and vandal versions what to expect from game being 5 years old and still in beta revxdev s about their ban for criticizing thanks for help getting this together to google chrome tl dr warframe started out great but has got worse over time and will continue to get worse unless de pulls a miracle out of nowhere they won t don t play it save your time a lot of content interesting and unique story variety of mechanics developer policy can ban you for nothing grind lack of balance powercreep game is a growing moneymaker
