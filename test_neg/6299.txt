2016 product received for free version 1 1 0 update the game continues it s trainwreck of being a design failure with cheaters growing more and more prominent than ever in this game with the most common ones being people who go and edit their game files in order to unlock all the highest level perks in the game along with the most rarest consumable items in infinite qualities of course this has been a very well known abuse exploit for months on end now dating back to people doing it in the beta and it has still not been fixed alongside the plethora of bugs but what about the free dlc then surely it must give the game some merits nope they went ahead and added more imbalance to the game in the form of the nurse a killer that can blink teleport vast distances instantly and immediately hit kill you after doing said teleporting with the only downside to doing this is a nausea inducing screen shake won 5 5 games effortlessly even against a few hackers game modders playing as her before i had to quit as i was on the verge of throwing up all over my keyboard what of the promised option settings then they ve added a few rudamentory simple keybindings that should have been in before release but besides that there s little to nothing to adjust be it fov music volume or even the most basic sh t in the world mouse sensitivity the developers have now also taken an extra step towards guaranteeing you having an even worse time playing by disabling the killer s ability to see the level rank of survivors before starting a game why would this be a negative thing you ask because now the killer has no option to try and get a more fair game as the developers still have not gotten around to making an even remotely functional matchmaking see for what matchmaking in 1 1 0 looks like you ve all been warned this was a decent game in beta however said beta was extremely restrictive with people only being able to play 1 map and 1 killer which has resulted in there being massive balance technical issues that could all have been identified solved before release if the developers did not stubbornly limit it since then things have only gotten worse and there are just so much broken rubbish in this game right now i m gonna have to list all of it to even have hopes of giving you an idea of what you re getting into 1 the developers promised weekly updates for the game they have as of june 24 2016 failed to deliver on this promise 2 the developers promised a system to play with friends to be coming very soon as of right now you cannot play with any friends unless you have a full premade game of 5 people it was a massively requested feature in the very beginning of beta possibly even earlier testing and today over 2 weeks after release they still don t have a release date for this function or even any details to give about it 3 any kind of feedback or data the developers are receiving from the community in regards to balance be it killers items perks or survivors their one and only response to all of it has been get gud 4 it is very likely for you as of right now to not be able to play the killer at all the system for hosting a lobby as a killer has since the introduction of easy anti cheat after the beta been completely broken for certain people in the form of having absolutely noone join your lobby if you decide to create one as a killer even if you wait for 5 hours and i personally know the pain of this as i m currently suffering from it no this is in no shape way or form an issue with my network my computer or anything that has to do with me or even other people for that matter i ve hosted hundreds of games as a killer in the beta just for it to suddenly break at release topic of what i ve tried to do to fix it here along with others having same issue here a massive amount of people are reporting having their progress profiles be indiscriminately randomly deleted corrupted lost by the game if you re gonna play this game as of right now you need to backup all of your local data or forever be stuck with nothing 6 as of right now if you play as a survivor and the killer you re facing decides to ragequit the game for whatever reason you will be punished by having your rank items be lost 7 even with the introduction of easy anti cheat cheaters are still prominent in the game 8 as of right now it s possible to infinitely kite any killer in the game endlessly with the use of a single window frame you can repeatedly vault over it back and forth faster than the killer can vault through it run around and catch you with it this has not been properly fixed in 1 0 2 as survivors even without perks can vastly out kite anything the killer does at a gross amount of different window vaulting spots on all the maps unless the killer lag switches and makes his location be horrendously delayed disguised to see just how much of a problem this is even in the latest patch that have adjusted it view this video youtube video dead by daylight engaging innovative gameplay views 226 behaviour digital inc has outdone themselves in this 1 0 2 patch to truly have adjusted the vaulting mechanics in this game sufficiently 9 the developers stated that there would be matchmaking in release this ended up not being the case this has continued to be a non existant feature now into patch 1 0 2 meaning that with over 3 patches the developers have still failed to create an even remotely functional matchmaking system 10 the bug report section on the forum on steam alone right now has over 1 500 topics 11 the head developers ran off to not only e3 the moment their game released and stayed there for several days but also pax essentially guaranteeing that there would be as much delay as possible for getting the game fixed 12 a big percentage of people who ordered the deluxe edition of the game has still not gotten their promised content weeks after release 13 the developers are always being incredibly close lipped even admtting to wanting to censor their artbook because of and i quote now forces higher than us 14 having someone with even small amounts of lag can have and will consistently severely break the game be it being grabbed through walls being hit 45 feet away being completely incapable of picking up a survivor that s spinning around on the ground with high ping as a killer disallowing the animations to synch up to properly pick people up and it has not even been adressed i could go on trust me but at the end of the day the thing that scares me the most is the attitude of the developers and how they are setting their priorities a gross majority of people reporting that the wraith is op get gud even though you can currently and consistently bug abuse with him to get no cool down on melee swings and unintentional movement speed increases massive lists of critical bugs reported by people minutes after release have 85 of the 1 0 1 patch be graphical adjustments and text fixes you ve all been warned
