2023 get warhammer ii if you are looking for a great experience for a great price for the third installment prices have skyrocketed whilst the content per dlc has been drastically reduced also major bugs are left untreated it s clear that this is the final installment of the trilogy people have paid for 3 games and now the developers are trying to squeeze players until the end of tww3 s lifecycle so if you don t have this game yet i ll say it once again get warhammer ii it s 99 of this game for a fraction of the cost even including all the dlc you can even get the first game for a penny nowadays and it s dlc also applies for newer games in a few years time you can probably get this game and all it s dlc for a somewhat reasonable price don t reward the developers for what they are doing with warhammer 3
