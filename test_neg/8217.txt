2021 ever wanted to spend possibly hours doing arduous dungeon crawling and meticulous wand tinkering cheesing the game as much as humanly possible only to get one shot by really random stuff and having nothing to show for it then this is the game for you wasn t really for me though i ve played a lot of roguelikes but noita is the only one where i never felt compelled to start another run after dying in the first almost every death felt cheap and undeserved the dungeon crawling was grueling due to the lack of health regen options making every minute mistake punishing and the progression is non existent it is a cool game a very unique concept the wands are cool making neat interactions the map and monsters are interesting but all in all i just felt miserable playing it maybe it just is not my game but it must do something well if its got such good reviews
