2020 i have played warframe for a pretty long period of time and i just cant recommend it to anyone simply because of the direction the studio chose to take constant buffing and nerfing meta weapons to encourage players to farm more and hopefully purchase forma seems like a pretty predatory practice to me i can never be sure when my favourite weapons get thrown into the dumpster pile it is also abundantly clear that the business model is gearing towards getting more new players into the game and turning the old players away as they believe that the older players would not spend as much as compared to the newer players surely most negative reviews posted here would be from veterans who feel shafted by the studio s choices as they probably wouldn t express concern if they didn t care about the game in the first place warframe used to be a really fun game where i was really excited to see what new updates were in the pipeline but at this day and age seeing that game in my steam library really does leave a sour taste in my mouth really sad to see such a good ip being squandered in this manner i really do hope it improves in the near future but i do have little hope of that ever happening
