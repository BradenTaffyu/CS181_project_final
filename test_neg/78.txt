i simply do not understand how this game is overwhelmingly positive it feels in many places extremely amateurish in fact level design is objectively terrible huge open maps that feel procedurally generated they re so bland the game is positively littered with invisible walls which makes exploring a tedious mess running down a path only to find that this one ends in an invisible wall while that one allows you to continue walking is shockingly awful levels are massive open spaces with a tiny smattering of enemies the game feels like a boss rush the camera is terrible the bosses range from fine to terribly designed the gear progression is completely pointless the story is non existent encounter design is comical the devs might have said the game isn t a souls like but it very obviously is sadly it s a bad souls like it s not even in the same universe of the best games in the genre obviously it s hilariously bad compared to from games but it s also massively inferior to the deck 13 games the remnant games the team ninja games and most of the good 2d souls like games the game swings wildly from so comically easy the game is boring to annoyingly designed difficulty where you spend 60 percent of a fight literally running after a boss or running away as a boss floats in the air the game looks nice i guess that s all it takes these days
