the game is pretty amazing on its own especially if you haven t ever played the original dragon s dogma or especcialy dd dark arisen it is plagued by performance issues however windows users get it bad but currently linux users get 50 the performance of windows users due to the game only being able to utilize 50 gpu and 50 cpu regardless of your setup now for those who have played and enjoyed original dd this game is a major downgrade in almost every respect except for the beautiful world and graphics so much has been dumbed down that the list would be pages long broadly however combat no longer requires strategy tactics or preparation this game is a button masher due to how leveling works regardless of what equipment you use you will reach a point just from leveling up normally without grinding where it ll be pretty easy to win every battle just using your default attack and occasionally trying to dodge a hit or two this game has fewer weapons fewer pieces of armor and fewer types of enemies than the first game augments don t matter at all you can play without any just as well as you can play with them enabled and probably never notice a difference due to the innate imbalance of the game clothing slots were removed armor was dumbed down and simplified to be more skyrim style the pawn inclination system has been dumbed down bestiary knowledge no longer exists even the rating system has been simplified i would never recommend this game to a fan of dragon s dogma in its current state however like i said at the start of this review this game will be fun for those who haven t experienced the original dragon s dogma and enjoyed it
