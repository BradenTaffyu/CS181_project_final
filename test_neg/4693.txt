do not buy on steam buy the game on battlenet to make sure that it functions properly and you don t run into ridiculous errors that prevent the game from working i made the mistake of buying it on here and now i get an unsolved profile signed out error when opening the game and mid games the game will eventually stop working and you will not be able to get past the initial loading screen you will spend more time wiping the game from your hard drive and reinstalling it that you will playing it buy it on battlenet and save yourself the pain this is the first and only call of duty i will be buying from steam again
