2019 nvidia and rockstar agreed to remove this game from the formers streaming service geforce now gfn under normal circumstances i would recommend this game if only for the online portion alone at this moment in time with gtav and the rest of the franchise removed i cannot and will not recommend this game i spent money on it and in it gfn users are unable to mod or break the game in any way there was no reason to pull this game from the service if you are a gfn user coming to buy this game don t bother wasting your money and don t give r the time of day we were given no news or warning of this change this review will stand as it is until gtav is re enabled on gfn returngtav do not purchase r already has a bad reputation for bad business
