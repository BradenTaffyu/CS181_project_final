2021 general premise is good from a technical aspect the game is amazing but there s way too much rng at play here for me to really recommend it to anyone you pretty much know before you get to the fourth stage whether or not you can actually get a win you either get good rng and get the items necessary to get a clear win or you don t and you die in hiisi base let me break this down a bit further so there are certain what i d call keys i suppose that the typical player will need to be able to make it to the bottom of the world kill the final boss and complete the basic game for a victory you need a wand that can inflict enough damage to kill your enemies you need a tool to dig and you need enough sustain to last between heals in the holy mountains there are a lot of ways to go about this but the game is completely random about what you do and don t get so on one run you might get unlucky get no wands that can inflict any damage that s notably better than your starting wand get no health increase pickups beyond the guaranteed 10s in the holy mountains and have no way to bypass enemies you can t fight by way of digging and simply die once the enemies become too strong and too tightly packed for you to run away from aka when you get to stage 4 hiisi base or alternatively you might get lucky get 4 25 health pickups and a wand with multiple black holes and another that s got 250 base mana 100 mana regen spark bolt with trigger 8 slots a multi cast and multiple instances of chain saw and be able to literally rip through everything up to the stage 6 or so all before you hit your first holy mountain there s very little space in between whether or not you get the necessary things to get a win and whether or not you get outscaled by the enemies there are a few hidden static perks that you can go get to weigh things in your favor you can easily get 2 25 health ups guaranteed before your first holy mountain if you re willing to put up with running around doing nothing for like 10 minutes and you know they re there but that doesn t really amount to much it almost always comes down to wands and perk luck in the end you might as well just go play a slot machine you d probably have better odds of getting a win and i m saying this as someone who s got an 11 orb victory under my belt and has gone for 32 orb runs twice i want to like this game and in a lot of ways i do thematically it s great but the rng is too much with over a hundred games under my belt and quite a lot of time invested in guides and watching extremely skilled players play the game i ve won three times that s with knowing where everything is in ng exactly what combination of wands are good and what aren t what perks to go for what to skip what enemies to fight what to run away from and when the game is just too random in the unforgiving way mods help with this mods that add more items to the shop in the holy mountain by default particularly go a long way toward making noita more fair if you re the kind of person that doesn t care about achievements then modded noita will probably be something very fun for you to play it s honestly better than the base game in a lot of ways
