2023 clocking 80 hours on steam recently and a additional 300 on both pc gamepass xbox console prior i can say for certain the game wasn t worth 60 back in the day and really not even worth it for 40 the game doesn t offer enough actual content to be worth more than a big indie game after a 7 month long season 9 scrapping season 11 and merging it into the current mega season 10 the devs are once again somehow adding bare minimal content to many degrees stuff we ve already seen before but reskinned repurposed with the only notable piece of content being guilds you could say this has been the norm for rare since the game launched first i just wanted to say any game can be fun with friends that doesn t necessarily mean it s a good game so with that in mind i ll keep it brief as i can dev team being stretched too thin working on both sea of thieves everwild and they ve been shuffling devs back to everwild since season 10 released bare minimum content even after almost 6 years it feels as empty and dull as it did back in 2017 gameplay just can t get away from issues such as hit registration which is still just as bad despite rare claiming it d work on 9 10 shots with season 10 that was generous of them to say not accurate but generous engine unreal 4 is a complete mess especially since rare has more or less developed their own version of unreal 4 just for sea of thieves this is why the game stopped receiving such major changes upgrades and even minor changes or additions take so long you can find a video from unreal engine s youtube titled aggregating ticks to manage scale in sea of thieves which covers explains this bit more nothing to do after reaching pirate legend besides hunting curses hunting commendations mindless grinding tall tales aside from a pirate s life they re really not that good even the monkey island ones and adventures after that all you have is the largely pointless factions to grind their numbers up shop items are overpriced and honestly feel like rare s major focus when they do add content just look at the patch notes for this season they ve added returned far more pirate emporium shop cosmetics this season than they ve added basic gold doubloon cosmetics in ages no anti cheat makes this game actual hell to play pvp modes like hourglass rare said there d be anti cheat eventually but the fact it s still not present when the season kicked off when most people are checking the game out again is a terrible mistake on their part that s still just the tip of this game s horrible iceberg even when everything is eventually added safer seas pvp voyages anti cheat etc i could not recommend it as season 12 will likely have even less meaningful content and given what we ve seen on the insider build that concern is accurate
