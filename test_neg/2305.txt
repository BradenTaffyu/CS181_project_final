2023 okay lets speedrun this to get to the part that matters this review is written on the 20 11 23 so were talking season ignite my group and i play weekly on weekends at max rank gold 2 since launch of apexand have each an avarage of 1 2kills per game with 300 400damage avarage accountlevels between 200 500 the last season me and my group of 3 people quit because we only got matched against players with a far suppirior skill level than us for example beening matched in ranked and unrankend against players with 20killbatch 4khammer masterrank in one or more seasons and or smurths with such a good aim and movement that even me beeing the strongest in our group i didnt even get a chance before beeing killed now around 3 4weeks later we wanted to try the game again hoping that the experience would have been improved or at least not worsend but boy we were wrong it was okay for 1 evening with around 4games in the limited time mode 3strikes than the next day playing with someone new in our group that hasnt played for 3 years account levl 150 we got matched exclusivly against tripplemaster or even tripple predators this matchmaking is a joke i cannot recommend this game to anyone who dosnt want to invest thousands of hours getting to a level where he can start matching the skill of the players you get matched against for someone with the time of a normal adault this is simply not doable
