i can t in good conscience recommend dd2 to others despite the act that i have enjoyed it i ve played through both dd2 and dd da and frankly the only upsides to dd2 are graphics and vocations most of dd2 is repetitive with only some side quests being unique such as the one to do with elven archery and the sphinx a the main story is frankly pathetically abysmal and while it seem cool on the surface it had no where near the impact that dd das story had with all thing leading upto the fight with grigori does dd2s dragon even have a name they talked about there was new bosses but that s just the thing they added a few new bosses but cut just as many if not more unique enemies from the original the open world feels somewhat glorified as its like shoving someone into a minecraft cave system on adventure mode the new vocations are cool such as trickster and mystic spearhand as well as wayfarer but the fact that instead of having the old 6 skills you only get 4 especially knowing you could ve made 8 seems idiotic the fact to changed the specialised inventory to be the standardized le survival game type seems just like a loss of the old uniqueness i personally don t enjoy the new wyrm forging either as getting red wyrm forge and then a gold wyrm forge on your preferred set seems more like a test of skill thansome little crystals you give to the dragonforged it really feels like they tried to make something unique but everytime they wanted to the investors complained and we ended up with this mediocre garbage its sad to see that this will be the end of dd series become this
