i really used to enjoy this game but recently behaviour has consistently disappointed me with updates that break more than they fix them having to constantly disable killers items or maps matchmaking and the connection between survivors and killer are extremely spotty to the point that killers can hit your from ten feet away grab you after you have completely finished a vaulting animation and have started to move again or just generally teleport around behaviour has seemed to focus on pumping out content and crossovers for more money rather than fixing the existing issues with the game
