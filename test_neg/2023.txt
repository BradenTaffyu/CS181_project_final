great game great idea and combat system sadly very frustrating due to ping compensation mechanic being abused by players playing on servers they re not meant to there are literally combos that you can only pull off on high ping due to air attacks pushing people farther higher to give players with high ping more time to react infinite spammable combos inconsistent parries i can only guess dependent on ping lots of bots making it unsatisfying when you can easily tell whos a bot and realise that about 70 of players you meet in ranked matches are bots with such a big playerbase why do the devs even feel the need for bots past low ranks if you really study the game you can usually counter the ping abuse infinite combos and parry problems but even if i like studying how games work why would i want to spend so much time on finding out the minuscule details of the game code instead of just playing the game to get better especially when i can get a better and more fair experience from other games out there you basically need to be on the skill level of the top hundred players to be able to consistently counter ping abuse it s a shame because i really like the idea and love action melee combat but at this point if i want a fairer competetive experience i d rather just play some fps and even if i wanted to just play casually too many people abuse the game in unranked matches too
