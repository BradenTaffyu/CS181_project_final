2022 i am going to give this a negative review and i will explain why this is a tough review for me as i have a love hate relationship with this game and its developer i cannot recommend this game to anyone that has never played it before i can only advise that you steer clear and find something more enjoyable to play and sink your time into when i first purchased this game at release 7 or so years ago the game was in a great place ubisoft were steadily adding maps operators and fixing bugs and exploits to the satisfaction of the community at the time they seemed really engaged with their community and player base matches were exciting and enjoyable the maps were reasonably balanced as were the operators the player base was growing albeit with some toxicity in the chat and the odd cheater you ran in to but this was always going to happen with a popular game fast forward to now and its a completely different game firstly map reworks for majority of the maps have been slapped together hell some of them make absolutely no sense operators have mostly gone the overwatch valorant route with space age abilities player skill based match making is just plain strange every single game you enter is either toxic in chat someone upset because someone has killed them and resorting to insults and being toxic or just doing it for the hell of it team killing is still an issue despite attempted deterrents cheating has become much worse during free weekends it s at its peak and out of control and these people seemingly are able to do this for a long time before any action is taken the same applies for people playing out of region with 200 plus ping bogging down latency network issues are still a thing despite server moves from google to amazon servers in fact this seems worst hit reg can be non existent at times despite the kill cam showing otherwise you squelching bullets into someone s face when they magically turn around and hit you once with a headshot out of nowhere despite the fact you re landing shots first even showing this on kill cam customer support is pointless copied and pasted replies and even with a single ticket you end up speaking to different people throughout the conversion which frustrates and confuses things further feels bot like i still find the whole ban click system very strange ubisoft claim to investigate on a case by case basis when you 1 click a player in game but it s already been exposed that they go off pure volume of reports without checking this this i m sure leads to many innocent people on the receiving end of bans for breaching the terms of service ubisoft once a great company with in previous experience great games and customer service now just copy and paste queens only interested in greed generating revenue to fund more copy and paste game titles and badly thought out game changes a terrible greedy company with a non existent customer service focused attitude i feel sad for the employees despite my negativity and experiences of the above i must confess i still play this game from time to time i think it s some form of stockholm syndrome as a small part of me believes things will change and they will eventually see the error of their ways sadly deep down i know this won t be the case if you haven t bought this game yet please don t it s a train wreck invest your time and hard earned cash in something else
