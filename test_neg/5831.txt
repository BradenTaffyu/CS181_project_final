2019 great game but terribly poor match making newcomers mode is totally screwed by experienced players just training on noobs please ubisoft realize that the level in the game the actual level of a player are really two different things below level 50 doesn t mean you re not crazy good with your aiming for instance we should get a rank directly after a few casual newcomers matchs and be able to play with real newcomers please address this issue asap the game is great but the match up system will just push many new players out
