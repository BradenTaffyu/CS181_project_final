vac feels like it s asleep at the wheel letting cheaters ruin every lobby without consequences those annoying bot farm accounts in deathmatch valve does zip about them it s been forever since we got any new stuff or a fresh operation like are they on vacation where did all the cool community maps go in matchmaking it s getting stale playing the same ones they randomly axed achievements and didn t bother replacing them with anything exciting no danger zone no team deathmatch come on valve give us some variety bugs galore and performance let s just say it s not winning any awards the ranking system is wonky at best leaving us scratching our heads even after switching to mr12 the economy is stuck in the stone age movement and shooting feel clunkier compared to before which is a major bummer update just dropping a line to chat about the recent cooldown changes two hours is a pretty sweet spot so thumbs up on that but hey let s talk about the elephant in the room hackers running into aim bots is a buzzkill right and when you re stuck in a match with them it s like hitting a brick wall trying to surrender forget about it vote fails every time and if you bail early bam cooldown city oh and remember that hacker i reported ages ago yeah still seeing them around what gives hackers like these are seriously making me consider leaving the game for good
