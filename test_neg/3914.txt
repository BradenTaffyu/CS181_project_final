2017 dont buy this game if you plan on modding it because you cant now now i love the game dont get me wrong but the only reason i bought it on pc was for the mods i even had to upgrade my computer for it and now i cant play it how i want to even though rockstar has openly embrassed mods so i guess if youre fine with playing the game vanilla go ahead the game itself is fantastic but for us who want to play the rediculous or immersive or whatever mods you need to stay away because you are not allowed to now aperently its a damn shamerip open iv edit 7 7 2017 take two realised that they were shooting themselves in the head with the whole mod thing and they rectracted their cease and desist on open ivhowever i still can t recomend it because after playing the new gunrunning update this game has become a grind its among the ranks of clash of clans levels of grinding it takes forever to get anything done in this game now but the game is still fun if you dont have to do all that but of course youre gonna want the new toys who wouldnt if so prepare to grind my friend
