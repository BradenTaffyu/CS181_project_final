2018 2020 update the game has a really persistent bug where lobbies get stuck into an infinite loading loop that never puts the players into the game activision and 3arch know about this bug since there are mentions of it going back to the launch of the game it seems to have gotten worse and worse as time has passed probably less lobbies so more broken lobbies encountered i tried to get into a game for 30 minutes this fine morning only to encounter loading screens and lobbies going nowhere i have no words left this game much like the publisher and developer is like the springfield tyre fire might entertain you for a while but ultimately is a pile of burning garbage another day another review and again one for a game that is hard to recommend but really kinda hard to bash the movement system is fun not titanfall level fun but fun nonetheless i like the specialists some of the maps are really cool finally a shooter with some color it doesn t have to be so damn serious and gritty all the time i got the base game for like 13e so there is a good amount of content for that price split screen on pc yeah boi however the unlocks are dumb grinding the game with subpar weapons for hours is not the way to design progress i can sort of get behind the attachment grind but do i hate the uneven playing field what anticheat the lag and lag comp are ridiculous the game sometimes just doesn t seem to keep up with its own movement system people are teleporting from lag comp when they are combining slide and jump hits aren t registering at point blank dying behind cover no the enemy did not have fmj etc etc apparently the aim assist exploit still persists season pass more like season ass the community is really horrid but then again what game doesn t have a bad community the biggest gripe is that reporting does absolutely nothing small ish playerbase i mean i do find games easily but it s against the same dudes when you run into a hacker it s better to just quit the game and leave it be it will keep pushing the same lobby to you even if you don t want to be in it runs piss poorly tested on a gtx970 i5 something something 8gb ram and installed on ssd framerates varied between 25 and 110 and this was on low settings on a gtx1080 you get 144fps on high but that is to be expected update edit unless you increase your fov in that case 122 is the best this can do and an unstable one at that random unlocks for weapons in lootboxes that you can buy for real money in a full priced game with a 50euro season pass that doesn t unlock all the content talk about a cash grab im not sure what the hell is going on but apparently the for me the quality of the connectin gets poorer and poorer the longer i play after todays grinding session i was experiencing some serious desync lag like missing point blank shotgun shots i have no idea what is going on but for now i can only play for about an hour or two before the lag gets worse or perhaps i was connecting to some more distant datacenters who knows so yeah the gameplay can be hectic and fun the first zombies map is kinda cool i like that it s not super serious but embraced the dumb multiplayer fun that it s supposed to be but kinda like street fighter 5 everything beside the core gameplay loop is horrible even if i keep on playing the game i can t in any honesty say that anyone should consider spending money on this
