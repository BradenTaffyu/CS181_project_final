2023 i have been playing total war games since empire and i have around 1700 2100 hours total between all of my owned total war games and what they are doing to warhammer 3 is an absolute disgrace the game still has countless bugs and listing them would take too long others have thankfully done this already on their reviews all the while they have the gall to charge 25 dollars for the new dlc which was the same price as the chaos dwarfs with like 150 less content i m absolutely revolted especially by their recent statement to the community in which they basically said they will stop support for the game if we don t suck it up and buy their overpriced lacking in content dlc which will probably introduce new bugs that wont be fixed for months on end due to these recent developments i can no longer support this franchise i could not recommend this game or this company s products to anyone in good faith anymore and thus i will be uninstalling warhammer 3 and will never buy another ca product until these issues are resolved in a timely and fair manner
