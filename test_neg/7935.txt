2021 saw a big skull with green glowing eyes sailed towards it followed a huge 30 minute fight ending in a pretty hard boss loot for days hauling it took over 30 minutes again sailed to the closes port enemy players sailed quickly away ship stopped why don t we move i don t know kraken fought off kraken finally arrived at a different port time to sell all those goodies and literally double our money we made in the first 20 hours of the game connection error has occured srsly this game it s great in so many ways but the connection problems are omnipresent and quite honestly ruined one of the best in game stories i ve ever lived through
