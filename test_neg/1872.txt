2023 game is good im not going to say you wont get your hours but the pricing is getting ridiculous wait till twh3 is on sale for 80 off then buy twh1 and 2 races to fill out your immortal empires youll get way more bang for your buck this way as the twh3 dlcs are insanely priced edited to add they are now showing twh2 1 dlc as twh3 dlc at full price this is pretty false advertising imho as you do not gain access to the full dlc by having twh3 just the race
