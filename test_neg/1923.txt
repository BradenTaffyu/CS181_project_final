tl dr the game has a really solid foundation to build upon but in the end it fails to deliver anything exciting or new i really loved the game in the beginning its an mmorpg survival looter shooter it has pvp it has pve amazing it was amazing till the honeymoon phase lasted dont get me wrong the game is amazing if you are a super casual gamer you take your 40 50 hour explore every last bit of map looking at the scenery building your dream base and then go off to play something else but if you want real mmo elements you want to have challenging pve fun and balanced pvp then game is not for you lets start at the beginning 6 week wipes why without going deeper into the wipe topics 6 weeks in this game means you can barely complete your perfect build if you nolife the game by the time you assemble your whole build you get like 1 week to enjoy it before it s taken away from you bull hit no snippy snappy the game heavily inspired from a lot of other genres and existing games which is not a problem in itself but in the end it miserably failed to improve on the already existing mechanics or ideas not just failed to improve but some basic functions features are enterily missing from the game building snapping gridlines to help the building process edit the game has originally did not have any snapping or grid lines but they have added it since then it s still a bit hit or miss but definitely much better than it was originallyphysicsyou have a good looking base you have gathered enough materials so you would like to explore the wilderness you walk to your garage build the car and then you realize how wonderful the vehicle handling is maybe you will experience the magical vehicle physics as well or should i say 404 vehicle physics not found with me nice you have overcome the lack of snapping you have survived your car crash as well so finally nothing stand in your way to enjoy the scenery experience all the different compounds all the different enemies right right no there are like 10 15 different type of enemies in the game and like 5 6 different compounds very very soon you will realize all the enemies all the bases compounds are literally copy pasta not a reskin not a more difficult version of the basic enemy or something like this no same enemy type but with more hp if you think it is rough already then wait there s more the mighty hammerapparently they are randomly banning people as well due to developer oversight issueslot of the translations are misleading the translations says something but the item ends up doing something completely different you will also find yourself stuck and frustrated pretty often as a lot of things are not explained at all in the game good luck figuring out on your own gameplay gamedesign problems the core gameplay loop and progression has very serious flaws too weapon build balance in general is all over the place pvp is utterly unbalancedyou can categorize the builds into 3 different tiers 1 top tier 2 mediocre 3 totally useless so you will see kinda everyone using the exact same one and only top tier build and 1 2 tapping everybody snipers sniper is already part of the top tier build so why not make it even stronger its basically hitscan you have projectivel travell time but its so fast its ends up being a hitscan weapon snipers almost all the time guaranteed to two tap you regardless of distance without even giving you any chance to fight back snipers does not have a scope glint the game renders the distant objects very poorly and gunshots have a very very low audio range if this is not bad enough already lets add salt to the injury no audio cue no visual feedback nothing at all the game lacks any kind of feedback which would tell you you are under fire if you are lucky enough you will notice the sudden drop in your hp yup thats the sniper but if not you will just sit there wondering what the actual f has happened now you are being punished really hard for dying repair is very expensive and does not matter if you are missing 10 durability or 100 the price is the same there is no progression or any kind of reward for participating in pvp lets just ignore the fact you dont even really have a place to pvp you can capture oil pumps in the so called engagement zone but the rewards are so bad literally nobody bothers pve has its fair share of problems as welthe world itself is not dangerous at all at lvl 10 you can easily clear the lvl 20 content no real dungeons or raids the dungeons we have in the game can be solod easily yes all of them yes even if you are a few lvls behind there is no mechanics or tacstics involved in the dungeons the bosses are simple bullet sponges dungeon loot is terrible saving your controllers for the highlevel dungeons will solve the issue one might think well kinda high level dungeons are artifically gate kept from you they are only available from phase 4 in game remember after 6 weeks there will be a wipe so you wait 4 weeks to be able to farm a dungeon to complete your build which you can enjoy for 2 weeks at most nosense issues the game seriously lacks of content both in pvp and pve as well the main character does not have voice acting your character is mute lot of side missions are not voiced either the ai in the game is missing the i aka intelligence they are very very dumbnot just the character models but their voice lines are copy pasted as well hearing the same three sentence all game long is not fun ripple detected in the spacetime spamthe world already feels empty and deserted there are dead servers already inability to repair looted gear this is both a pvp and a pve problem at the same time pvp and pve servers are almost identical no difference in playstyle or content available if you are joining a pvp server in hopes of epic pvp battles then i hate to bring it to you not just you will not encounter epic pvp battles be happy if you can pvp at all nope not a joke this is the reality the whole endgame loop is only about opening chests every 4 hours gear progression solely relies on the gacha machine if you hit your weekly cap you essentially cannot progress further i know a lot of people say the devs are cool they care they listen to feedback etc i m sure they do but to fix all these problems a small patch is not enough where they tweak some numbers the game suffers from identity crysis lastly please don t take my word for anything i said here just because i have more than 100 hours in the game i strongly encourage you to check out their offical discord their subreddit talk to people watch videos and then form your own view on the game
