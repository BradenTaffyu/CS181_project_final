2015 your typical grand theft template new storyline new characters same fun im leaving this review to address its online gameplay when not being subject to a modder s or hacker s myriad of exploits online gameplay can start off as fun you ll learn quickly however that the many necessary team oriented missions that are part of the online story can become a ridiculously repetitive nuisance this is mostly because the missions can be challenging and the people you play with can be mentally challenged and unfortunately if any member of the team fails any part of the mission you ll be restarting the mission or if any member leaves you ll be restarting the team building altogether and then of course the mission in its entirety doesn t sound bad factor in the load times between every fail restart or regroup and you ll think twice to avoid having a bad gaming experience because of other people you may try to vet the heist members in your lobby which has proven to take a minimum of 30 minutes per heist another option is to setup an all star team of just your friends but you may very likely run into a plethora of technical obstacles that will completely prevent you from playing altogether be it session time outs when you try to start a session member disconnection for whatever ridiculous bug that rockstar can t iron out or the painfully long load times between freeworld and heist sessions we all must endure when beginning concluding or all too commonly repeating any mission or heist simply put the online facet of gta seems to be forced and needs a lot more work from its seemingly non existent support to make the end user happy as it stands gta online is a huge waste of my entertainment time
