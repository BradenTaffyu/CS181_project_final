2017 used to be a great game filled with online money glitches an expansive world and an enjoyable single player experience but after shark cards became a major part of the game take two and rockstar have been pushing them more and more since the online currency is so painfully hard to come by and requires countless hours of grinding just to be able to afford a base level super car that s not including full upgrades which can run you over 50 the original value now with the legal removal of mods we see how much the company wants to push their own agenda and forcing the players to obey to their awful system of pay to win taking away mods from gta iv and gta v royally screws the mod creators and the people who enjoyed playing with the mods themselves this isn t nearly as bad as when mods were removed from minecraft or when mods became pay to win for skyrim fix this soon take two or your game and reputation as being one of the better game publishers is going down the trash
