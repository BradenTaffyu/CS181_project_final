2023 while total war warhammer 3 had a rocky launch once the immortal empires update launched it initially seemed as though lessons had been learned and improvements were going to steadily come tragically things have not panned out well updates are extremely slow and leave gamebreaking bugs in the game for months at a time said updates come almost solely alongside new dlc but said dlc also have a habit of introducing new bugs to the game creating a problematic circle i will not go into too much about the latest dlc here as this review is about the main game but this game s trend is highly concerning and the latest dlc which is very expensive for the amount of content on offer and leaves many core design issues unresolved is part of any consideration of the game s future prospects as things stand at this time i cannot recommend this game so long as it stands on its current course prospective fans should instead consider total war warhammer 2 as while it has less content it is more polished by far and will regardless satiate a new player for dozens to hundreds of hours until hopefully warhammer 3 has received the treatment it needs
