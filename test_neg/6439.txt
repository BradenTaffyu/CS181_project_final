2019 ignore anyone s review with anything less than 500 hours they most likely don t know how to play survivor or killer correctly this game has an extremely high skill cap and not being skilled at it will yield an annoying experience as you ll go down a lot as survivor or not get kills often as killer with that said here it goes first i ve met one of my best friends through this game as well as countless other good friends i still talk to and i wouldn t trade that for anything this game has yielded great experiences from when i first played survivor crouching around the map to recent days of running from and messing with the killer i should say i play killer survivor with a 50 50 split i ve achieved rank 1 with killer and survivor multiple times but you re most memorable times will probably come from playing survivor anyways this game has been a blast a truly fun experience learning how to run from the killer or learning how to mind game survivors as the killer with a decent twitch community behind it there s always something new to watch or learn about the game but i can t in good faith recommend this game and it really hurts to say that the main problem with this game is you aren t rewarded for ranking up there are no rewards for your work you re actually penalized as you rank up this game becomes much more toxic survivors and killers both because of their high rank will feel entitled to the win survivors will t bag and troll you and make sure you know in post game chat their opinion of whether you should be toaster bathing yourself or not and if you become a good survivor it makes a lot of killers mad oh you ran me for 3 gens that s an automatic facecamp facecamp is when the killer hooks the survivor and doesn t leave them to make sure they die and yes that s an actual quote said to me which makes you de pip partial de rank which is another thing the ranks every game is ranked whether you like it or not and if ranking up is your main goal prepare to be disappointed if the killer disconnects you de pip load in the game and one of the survivors didn t load in and its a 1v3 probably a de pip made the killer mad somehow and now he s facecamping you de pip double pip is extremely hard nowadays you have to do pretty much everything to do so so most games will be just a normal pip but that game where you pipped that took 20 minutes well next game you got found first and hooked and as soon as you were unhooked the killer tunnels you immediately and downs and hooks you again so back down your rank goes rinse and repeat i guess what i m trying to say each game is a coin flip of it ll be a toxic waste of time or an actual enjoyable game the main problem in this game is one you won t face unless you get to rank 1 which is that at the core of the game survivors control the game and are much stronger than the killer the time it takes to down one good survivor 3 or 4 gens will be done and extend that time depending on if they have decisive strike or not which essentially is a get out of jail free card but like i said that s only with good optimal playing survivors so now that i ve talked about the game play let s talk about the stability of the game and it s developers bad real bad constant survivor dc s when game starts loading screens getting stuck you name it and every time the game fails to load you lose your offering that s right even if you don t actually load in the game your offering still gets used up sucks for you i guess also i don t exaggerate when i say with every patch or dlc release a slew of bugs come with it i don t know whats up with this game s code but every time they tweak something it opens the flood gates to bugs the devs hardly seem to listen as well people have been asking to buff freddy since he was released still nothing people have been complaining about decisive strike being too strong nothing they said those 2 things are both in the works but does it really take over a year to hear your loyal players out i guess they have their development road map is top dog and well thought out criticism can take a back seat one time when the game s lead designer was asked in a qna about what to do when killer gets too frustrating because it s so stacked against the killer at times making it literally impossible to win he said to go play civ 5 i m not kidding the devs just see us as crying kids not happy that the game isn t perfect but we don t want it perfect we ve played the hell out of it we love it we want it to be better and it could be and it s a shame it isn t because i love this game but it s a buggy unbalanced unrewarding grind which is another topic by itself i m talking 300 hours or so to get all the perks on everyone without prestiging and it s just not worth it i don t regret the time i put into this game but it s not something i can recommend i know the market is a bit short of multiplayer horror games but this is less horror and more a game of toxic bug ridden tag it hurts to say but don t waste your time
