i ve got 168 hours in this game and honestly enjoyed it until this recent update this is the most time gating and annoying content they could have released i played 1 mission and realized i will not be playing this game this season absolutely horrible new mechanics which slows down farming so much that it takes 15 minutes to complete 1 simple mission nexon you guys really know how to annoy your player base
