do not play or buy this game as of sep 17 2024 rockstar has decided that they are going to lock out anyone using linux by installing anti cheat their official reply from a support ticket is this we certainly understand that you are unable to login to gta online through steam deck after the update we would like to inform you that the primary goal of incorporating battleye into gta online is to enhance the overall gaming experience by actively scanning for cheats and exploits and preventing players with cheats and mods from entering online the steam deck players will not be able to join gta online but should be able to launch single player without any issues we appreciate your understanding in this matter if you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to let us know we are here to assist you so their idea of enhancing the gaming experience is to basically just cut off a portion of their players which i very much doubt were the ones causing the cheating to begin with instead of writing code that was much more robust and had some kind of checks and balances to prevent this type of hacking they just decided that it would be easier to drop in some third party code and wash their hands of it well congratulations rockstar you have just cut off your own nose to spite your face i don t want to play single player as i purchased this to play with my friends online which i am now unable to do i cannot recommend this game
