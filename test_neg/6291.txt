it s been a long while since i played dead by daylight waited half a day to install it played first match as survivor killer idling played another one killer bot bought a new killer knight using free currency iridescent points waited 20 minutes in queue for matchmaking new killer was very hard to play got bullied and then insulted in chat played the next matches using the trapper my favourite killer won 2 survivors were mindless lose 1 matched against seasoned players realized that the game is unbalanced and devs only care about money uninstalled it never more
