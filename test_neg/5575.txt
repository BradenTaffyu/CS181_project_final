siege is a fun game for sure but it has the most inconsistent and unreliable servers i have ever experienced in 10 years of playing video games specifically over christmas 2023 and new years servers have been down more times than they have been up frequently stating that servers are unreachable at this time even after several attempts of closing and reopening the game this issue does not appear to be limited to me either as all of my friends experienced the same issue when i can play the game it is a lot of fun but it s hard to enjoy a game that has such notoriously unreliable servers
