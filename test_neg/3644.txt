2021 gta5 itself is okay gta online is designed specifically to be not quite fun you ll have fun but the game will seemingly trip itself up at every opportunity to make itself less fun with the aid of players who can and will constantly kill you or attempt to if you respawn next to someone and they kill you they can continue to kill you indefinitely as the game will strive to spawn you as close to where you died as possible which also means right next to the person who killed you who is probably looking at the area you ll spawn in and in cover while you spawn out in the open with no cover and likely facing away from the person killing you that is just one of the many ways gta online is not quite fun
