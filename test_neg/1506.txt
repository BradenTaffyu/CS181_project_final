2022 i love total war games and i m an even bigger fan of the warhammer series this game functionally isn t very different from warhammer 2 but with tons of news races and some new mechanics it gives a new feel and a new way to play the best part is the more than 2 player multiplayer campaign which allows you to play with all your other friends in a big map but this is where i hate the money hungry decisions being made because you need warhammer 1 2 and 3 in order to play mortal empires which is the premier gamemode and the one where you can have the most fun with your friends i already paid 60 for a game and i even own the others but the fact that you need to dish out another 50 80 depending on when you buy them in order to use a part of the game that should just come with it ruins it
