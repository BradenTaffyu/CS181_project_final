2022 lets see almost a 100hrs on this game and these are the issues 1 chinese smurfing on eu and na among new players their high ping makes it impossible to hit them literally 2 eu and na players are leaving thanks to the chinese players using vpns to get easy wins once again using rubber banding 3 almost every match you have squads teaming up together mostly chinese players farming points and its usually 4 players vs 2 in duo or 6 vs 3 in trios conclusion great game overall very bad and horrible management in the west cant even prevent vpn users from playing on the western servers frankly don t bother buying this game as long as the devs keep blind eye to what s going on with the current state of the game in the west also hackers are barely getting banned since you encounter them on daily basis update 3 5 2023current state of the game in every match is mix of bots and ton of chinese players in the lobby i rarely come across actual players from eu update 2 4 2023 nothing has changed just more events and no bug fixes chinese players are openly teaming up together during matches now they wont bother hiding it videos has been recorded and submit yet nobody got bannedthis is the final update regarding my review on this game dont buy it
