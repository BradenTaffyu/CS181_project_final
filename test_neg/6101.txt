2023 the only reason people like this game is because it has no competitor in the industry dbd is an extremely flawed and unfun game once you get past the initial phase when you re a beginner learning the game and just trying to have fun the game has no separate ranked and casual queues which means every match you play will be a sweat fest which will make it extremely unenjoyable unless you re constantly tryharding every single game during which people from both sides will utilize underhanded tactics to either ruin your enjoyment or to secure a win faster now obviously people are free to play how they want however it s the game it s self that facilitates and encourages these things which is where the problem lies oh yea also the matchmaking for this game sucks which means you ll likely get curb stomped by people with 1000s of hours of game time who are infinitely more knowledgeable than you which is super frustrating i would also go so far as to call this game p2w you see despite the fact that this game costs 20 euros on base every few months the developers release paid expansions with new characters now these characters also have global perks you can put on any other character the licensed characters such as pyramid head nemesis pig etc cannot be earned ingame at all and often these paid characters have great meta perks without which you re simply not playing on an even playing field so unless you re constantly buying new expansions you ll seriously struggle to keep up with the meta and compete with more experienced players running sweaty builds also this game treats you like you might as well be a free to play player this game is seriously grindy you see when you play any character you need to unlock perks which seems fair enough however you need to farm a currency called blood points and then randomly roll and hope that you get the perk you want out of all the other perks you currently own globally which may seem fine until you realize there s over 200 perks in the game and you need to do this for every single character you own which means you ll be spending anywhere from 2 3 days to maybe build up the character you want to play and then doing this on repeat for other characters there s also another in game earnable currency you can farm called iridescent shards which lets you unlock non licensed dlc characters which is great however the rate at which you get these shards is abysmal which means you ll be playing for months without unlocking all the characters for a game that costs you twenty euros at base and this is without considering the fact that you unlock cosmetics with the same currency as well which are super expensive would i recommend this game casually no i believe this game becomes repetitive and unfun after about 8 10 hours even with friends just go play deep rock or phasmophobia instead would i recommend this game if you re a competitive player who wants to sweat also no this game has no real ranking system where you can check a regional or global leader board so you ll never really have a competitive ladder to climb and compare yourself to and the tournament scene of this game isn t exactly popping either all in all i believe dbd is simply just not a game worth your time or your money there are other games which are significantly more fun with friends which won t be as frustrating to play 4 10 stay away from this game
