2023 look at the hours i put in this game the game is fun but i dont recommend any new players from playing the community is one of the most toxic in the gaming community and the chances of your account being hacked or messed with during online play is guaranteed you can expect to be continually messed with while playing online by those with hacks on their accounts and if you do manage to progress far enough into the game there are people in this game that can take away your account as well as sensitive info while you are playing for your safety i wouldnt play this game nothing but online scammers its is quite sad since before all this it was a good game i no longer play this game
