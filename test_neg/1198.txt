2022 first sections of this game were fun exploring both limgrave and liurnia was a joy and you could tell a lot of care was put into these zones my enjoyment really started to fall off after these areas however as the problems of the open world and from trying to one up themselves on difficulty started to become apparent i had to go back and play the original dark souls a bit to make sure i wasn t crazy and wasn t simply tired out of the formula bosses combata big draw of these games the bosses are simply unfun and tedious in elden ring here from has given so so many bosses combos that are way too long normally this wouldn t be too big of a deal however they can cancel their recovery often enough to add extra hits to the combo if they feel like it just to screw over your attempts to punish too often in er i feel like i m standing around waiting for the enemies to finish their epic chain combo before i can even maybe have a chance to land a hit in compared to the original dark souls where enemies had explicit combos they could pull off and gave the player time to punish and strike back it is also entirely unforgivable how many times i ve gotten to the end of a dungeon or catacomb only to fight the same half dozen or so bosses for the 4th time only this time around there s two of them or there s accompanying minions it s also exacerbated by the skyrim levels of copy paste that every catacomb mine and cave have going on they all look and feel identical to traverse npcs storyi m 100 hours in and i still don t know what it means to be tarnished or to be elden lord i don t know why i would even want to be elden lord meanwhile in dark souls it s laid bare who you are and what your goals are there in the intro you re told you re the chosen undead destined to ring the awakening bells link the flames and save the age of fire in er you re told nothing outside of the npcs in limgrave or liurnia they have a horrible habit of never telling you where they are going or what they expect of you upon completing a quest they will thank you and say they are continuing their journey and that s it the open world design might ensure you never run into or see this character again as they are now hanging out in a zone you cleared and have no reason to return to overall the game is interesting to see and explore for a while but the open world has really worked against it and the combat just isn t fun anymore many enemies have such insane speed and long combos they feel like they belong in a different game and it not fun standing around waiting for them to finish these moves just so you can have a chance e to play the game too
