2022 need to rewrite this review a lot in it is factually incorrect long story short a cautious recommendation but a recommendation nonetheless for now edit creative assembly has clarified that the drm was not the origin of the performance loss and there seems to have been a performance update bundled in with the champions of chaos update it s a good start and i may be switching my thumbs down to a thumbs up after investigating the performance increase some more the game is very good and i would wholeheartedly recommend if it weren t for the controversy surrounding the game s current performance according to certain media outlets www pcinvasion com the review build ran significantly better than the current build and in the case of the specific reviewer linked above lost over 50 fps on low settings on the current build of the game and on a monstrous machine at that the community is speculating that it was a large patch uploaded moments before the game went live that tanked the performance of the game possibly through the inclusion of denuvo anti temper aka anti piracy software regardless of the origins of this huge performance loss many reviewers and insiders advertised the game as running with similar performance as the previous instalment of the series currently if your pc was somewhat struggling to run total war warhammer ii you may potentially find yourself almost incapable of running the game at even below decent framerates beefier machines do not seem to be spared the performance loss although some may be able to bruteforce their way towards a better framerate if performance is a big deal to you or you possess a somewhat weaker machine i d advise you to wait until this issue is resolved unfortunately if the performance loss is indeed a result of denuvo current players of this game may find themselves in a similar situation as purchasers of doom eternal did not so long ago in doom s case was only removed after significant backlash www eurogamer net from the community yes the tech savvy among you will no doubt mention that the denuvo software packaged with doom eternal was theoretically far more intrusive worse than the denuvo software bundled with total war warhammer iii and although you might probably be right the core argument still stands that ca or sega may not feel pressured to address this issue unless there is significant public backlash similar to doom eternal to the best of my knowledge there has not yet been any communication from ca over this issue and the substantial performance loss in comparison to the review build but perhaps it is simply too early to tell if you are mindful of performance or possess a weaker machine i d advise you not to purchase the game at the present moment if you already own the game and happen to read this review i urge you to write a similar review with a big thumbs down as long as performance isn t restored to review build levels considering the amount of people that based their performance expectations on pre release videos this is borderline false advertisement if you are lazy but still wish to signal your disagreement feel free to copy and paste this review if you so desire i eagerly await the moment i can change this review to a thumbs up and promise to do so once ca takes action and resolves this issue
