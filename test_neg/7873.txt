2020 so when i signed up for this pirate game i didn t know i was buying a shooter i have played many pvp matches and had several engagements with other players only twice have i actually fought with swords everyone is quake jumping and zooming around reloading constantly due to the commendations for large amounts of kills people would rather spawn camp you than sink your ship the mute function works 50 of the time only and important functions like scuttle ship aren t shown to the player in the tutorial pretty much tired of it after 72 hours i might play more with friends but due to the toxicity and cancerous playstyles of the community i can t recommend this game
