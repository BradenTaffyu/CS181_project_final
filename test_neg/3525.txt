2017 i have now formally uninstalled gta v for a few reasons primarily i uninstalled the game due to the take two modding debacle currently ongoing this was the final culmination in the online section of the game which has been for a while a micro transaction hell hole of hackers cheaters and people with wallets so big they can afford the 100 needed to buy everything you could possibly want in a game you bought for 60 the micro transactions have now made the online near enough unplayable if you want to win races you need a car that can only really be gained by purchasing in game currency if not you have a very very long and repetitive grind ahead it s ridiculous if paying 60 for the game three times xbox 360 and one and for pc isn t giving the company enough money they ask for 50 every time you might fancy having a new appartment or clubhouse office or warehouse for the latest dlc packages which are now clearly for nothing other than financial gain i can not recommend buying the game if you want to play single player as a modded version and only play the online mode if you are either a stupidly wealthy or b lacking in anything else to do other than vegetate over a grind for not enough money to progress
