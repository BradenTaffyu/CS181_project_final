2020 generally it s an amazing game and you really can have a lot of fun well as long as you re alone with a few friends on a server or you just play singleplayer when there are more people with you at least one of them is a modder who teleports you over the map covers you in explosions changes your clothing and eventually lets your game crash stopped playing this game a few years ago cause of this annoying b llshit and lately gave it one more try but still the same thanks for not giving a f ck rockstar
