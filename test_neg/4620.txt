came to voice my opinion about the dante nerf upon release he was one of the most unique and fun frames to play in the entire game full of character a good jack of all trades without feeling a boring level of broken that saryn mesa and revenant sometimes feel like i dumped 6 forma into him and 4 shards just for him to get immideately gutted this nerf was unwarranted unfun and the tragedy changes should either be reversed or we get our forma back
