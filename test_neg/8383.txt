there is something great about this game there is a hand crafted world to explore in a hand crafted engine explicitly for it that has everything i wish terraria was there are so many cool things to go find unfortunately you aren t allowed to do any of that and are forced to repeatedly play the most streamer rage bait rouge like i have ever played imagine the binding of isaac but opening a chest has a small chance of just instantly killing you no matter how many hearts you have killing some enemies just has a chance to fill the room with lava or toxic gas that instantly kills you not does a lot of damage kills you people will tell you that learning is the fun of the game but opening a chest thats in water and having it spawn an electric item that instantly domes you for 200 damage when your starting health is 100 and health ups only give you 25 health is not learning i don t need someone to hold me down and whip me and tell me to keep having fun
