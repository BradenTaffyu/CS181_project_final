i am editing this review since the state of the game has improved since release i will not consider recommending this game until dlc is added and denuvo is removed there will be spoilers in this review this game has less content than the original dragon s dogma had despite the illusion of more due to the larger world many areas are underutilized or flat out unused elves there are technically more monster variations but they aren t much more challenging and once you ve fought the basic drakes around the world you ve pretty much tackled the biggest challenge the game has to offer there is no post game equivalent to what there was in dd1 and the game is roughly 60 the length without side quests speaking of side content there is a lot however most of it is pretty underwhelming and the only sidequests that received any real attention were the sphinx quests the sphinx quests were great and it s obvious a disproportionate amount of effort went into their creation as well as the sphinx being plastered all over the marketing to make you think the whole game was like this however the actual solutions to half of these riddles are pretty much impossible to figure out on your own and you re stuck reading a guide the biggest issue with this questline however is how it concludes where you re stuck with either a very unsatisfying boss fight that you re meant to cheese with an instakill or basically she just flies off and leaves you with nothing meaning all the design that went into the fight and the music is completely wasted it s a pretty good analogy for this whole game that has clearly had tons of effort put into it s development yet due to some very questionable design decisions most of that effort is wasted dragons dogma 2 is a middling experience and while it has it s moments it always ends up falling short and by the time you ve unlocked every zone you ve seen pretty much everything this game has to offer it fails to live up to the first game in this regard where your first playthrough was just the beginning and even a new game would still present you with challenges you d never seen on your first playthrough they had an entire decade and multiple times the budget to improve upon the formula of dd1 and somehow managed to make something inferior
