2023 at this time of writing they ve ruined the user interface that was there since launch causing you to launch the game again just to play multiplayer and again for warzone dmz even if you launch warzone and select dmz it wont let you go back and and play warzone without restarting the game which is totally backwards why would a game s sequel change the ui of the game that came before it let alone restrict features that were in the game before it released this isn t even a profitable decision its just infuriating to have to restart the game if i want to browse the menus for game modes
