2022 i m a 20 year total war veteran loved most of their games and can t imagine how many hours i ve actually played on them this is the first one that i ve never finished a single campaign you re actively prevented from expanding siege battles are an absolute mess who decided to add rts tower building and the majority of turns end up with you turtling and waiting for chaos rifts to open then there s the chaos realms bit which feels really forced and contrived but is the focal point of the game i just wanted to play the damn game and enjoy some battles with new factions but no i have to go with some weirdo s idea of what they think might be fun the whole point of tw games is that you get to play them your way you can t do it with this one it s incredibly frustrating and i gave up without finishing a single campaign feel ripped off if a dealer sold you a 60 bag of goods that didn t do the trick you d never buy from them again kinda feeling the same for ca right now
