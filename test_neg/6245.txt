2022 there is no room for casual play in this game 50 of killers feel completely useless against survivors forcing you to play a handful of meta killers that get the job done 95 of the percent of perks on both sides feel inferior to the meta counterparts forcing you to run a dozen or so meta perks no matter what build you re going for 100 of maps are survivor sided via random and numerous pallet spawns infinite loops with unbroken doors vertical boons that force killer to go out of their way to handle them or risk losing any map pressure they built killer players must sweat for any win against competent survivors i e hook camping tunneling slugging proxy camping survivor meta is the most boring in existence a handful of the perks are broken and win games and the rest are just funny meme builds that exist only for the sake of illusory variety killers are forced to use the most absolute broken add ons they can find to even stand a chance meanwhile survivors are incentivized to bring the most broken items they can spare gen rushing swf stacking hook camping intentional tunneling meta sweatingthese aren t toxic strategies that are used by shunned members of the community but rather intentionally designed aspects of the game that incentivized with higher bloodpoint rewards following a victory these are the core mechanics of the game they shouldn t be in a perfect world a killer wouldn t have to tunnel someone out of the game within the first 3 minutes to even have a chance of winning in a perfect world survivors wouldn t have to stack killer stuns to prevent being camped on hook in a perfect world maps wouldn t have this random design that facilitates endless looping the irony is that i love this game i was excited to play killer i enjoy stacking with my friends the addition of licensed characters is such an appreciated sight but holy this game tries its hardest to break any ounce of casual fun you can have you either sweat and win or you get rolled and are in denial about the fun you re having with your inferior build whats worse is that the grindy nature of this game actually prevents players from even experiencing the meta or being able to make build choices in the game the bloodweb system can essentially softlock you into playing with inferior builds unless you dump literal hundreds of millions of points and hundreds of hours into unlocking everything for the love of god rework every single map in this game change the mmr matchmaking systems literally gut the bloodweb and make a more friendly and less grindy way of creating builds and finally rework outright remove problematic perks add ons and items while buffing the unseen that takes up 90 of the games perk and item library the game is dying every sign points to this game bleeding players due to them being jaded by the games core mechanics if bhvr wants to pretend that things are still fine go ahead but when ringu dlc comes out this march read the reviews and weep
