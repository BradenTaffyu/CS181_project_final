2022 the aoe nerf was dumb you buffed the eximus so bad that new players struggle until they can get aoe weapons to take out the overshield easier when we re bombarded with a mass of eximus ruining the game for lower leveled people in order to make higher leveled people happy in the low level areas is bad design just make new tiers to the levels for higher players to enjoy things more make things in those tiers difficult it was hard enough for me to find a clan to get ignis wraith because its one of the best for lower levels and its locked to only clans that were around for a special event when you make it that difficult to get a strong weapon don t nerf it
