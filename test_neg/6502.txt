2017 tl dr the game is fun and awesome when you can successfully get into a fair game key phrases being successfully get into and fair game full review dead by daylight is a fantastic idea 4 unwitting victims from many different walks of life each with their own unique abilities and skills trying to survive as 1 killer who can be many different monsters from michael myers to a swamp witch tries to hunt you down you frantically try to start the generators to power the exit to escape the killers without being killed did i mention that at full build the game is actually well balanced i m not going to delve into all the mechanics of the game just see some gameplay footage for that but it s fun and feels like it could be anybody s game you re probably wondering why i m not recommending the game the problem is those sorts of games are about 1 in 10 let s start with the first big problem multiplayer netcode the multiplayer feels like an origin game in closed alpha our match ratio of lobbies formed to games played was nearly 6 1 because we averaged about 4 5 lobby crashes before we got a game and about 1 in 3 games either the killer dced before the game started i assume this was a server error rather than actually dc had a lagfest of a game to the point of teleportation all 4 in our party not on the same internet or once the game disconnected 2 of us and the killer and other player still alive stayed in no idea what kind of error that is the current system depipped me twice over killer dcs and also allows for teleport hacks by way of terrible internet even if the host is causing upward of 1000ms ping you can t disconnect without depipping also the game crashes too i witnessed it many many times last night furthermore the lost connection error in lobby screen also should not close the whole game rather exit to title let me repeat if you get a certain sever error you have to exit the game and restart it the multiplayer feels like an early access game or even a closed alpha the multiplayer is worse than titanfall 2 a game that was lauded by critics and almost everyone who played it but ultimately failed due to atrocius multiplayer and release window timing onto the second big problem matchmaking the current system allows for anyone waiting for more than 2 minutes to completely circumvent matchmaking and there is only ranked mode starting from your first game in a game that s been released for a year there is no quickplay and in ranked mode you can easily be placed against people much much better let me show you imgur com a game i played last night one of my first 10 games ever for context rank 20 is the worst possible rank and 1 is the very best i am a rank 20 it s like bronze vs challenger grandmaster to compare to more popular multiplayer titles this also leads us to a side note the grind in dead by daylight each character has their own unique bloodweb to sum it up you deposit in game currency and it spits out an assortment of random one use items offerings which are one use items that affect the whole game rather than your character and perks basically your extra skills unfortunately for you each character has a unique bloodweb and each one is ridiculously expensive to even unlock all 4 perks the fact that you can t even equip 4 perks until ridiculously high level nonwithstanding did i mention perks come in three tiers that are increasingly rare and therefore require even more grind basically the grind is league of legends tier in a game you pay for that s completely unacceptable let alone players with all level 3 perks and super rare items against players with one level 1 perk in a ranked game let alone the skill gap of the highest possible rank vs a team average of rank 17 these problems lead to even more problems like pushing away new players from a dying game a game where you get stomped over and and over again for hundreds of games if you even manage to load in will cause a lot of refunds and 2 1 hour playtime accounts oh yeah the graphics are mediocre at best even on ultra settings i could go on but for the sake of keeping this review sub novel length i ll just conclude with this this game is an alpha that the devs are treating as if it was finished don t buy it the good concept balance the bad grind graphicsthe fugly netcode matchmakingedit coming to you live from a new error the infinite loading screen a pip is a ranked point you need 3 to rank up depipping is the confiscation of a pip at full buildedit 2 hey guys it s been a wild ride since i bought the game and wrote this review tl dr they have dratically changed the game balance through a series of new stronger killers and a rework of an old killer making him significantly stronger along with other changes furthermore the devs don t think griefing defined as ruining the game for another player even if it disadvantages you is a problem i would not recommend this game more strongly now
