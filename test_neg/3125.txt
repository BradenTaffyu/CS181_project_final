2017 i mean i would say it s a great game looking at the graphics etc it really is a great game i ve enjoyed the hundreds of hours of playing this game even with every update bringing more op vehicles and weaponry than the next one however the developers rockstar games a bunch of greedy yoinkers make me change my mind entirely banning people for having graphic enhancers really and don t forget the fact that the game is older than most of the people who play it around 10 years old yet they still sell it for 60 bucks nice not anymore tho apparently so that s good tl dr rockstar can go hump themselves and as can the oppressor mk2
