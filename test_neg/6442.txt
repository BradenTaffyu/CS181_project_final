2016 this game started out strong with engaging gameplay and responsive devs unfortunately the devs are spineless and more interested in generating sales than providing on the premise they started with ignoring balance breaking cheats and exploits in the maps as well as broken abilities leaving them in to appease the larger portion of the playerbase as it is a 4v1 asymmetric game they continue to destroy what had a large amount of promise in the name of profits shame on you behaviour i d refund this if i could but the game only started its meteoric downhill shill slide after the steam grace period was already over
