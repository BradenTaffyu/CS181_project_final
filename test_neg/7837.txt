2023 i used to hate the players but now i hate the game the devs have said their piece on pve servers and that s made it pretty clear this game is a sandbox for bullies and predatory players by design there is merit to the pvp in this game and players have a dedicated pvp mode they can opt into but they don t because that would be a fair fight against a willing and consenting opponent instead they want to go into the main mode where naive players are drawn in by the whimsical aesthetic of the game and the draw of the seas only for their real purpose to be food for the sharks no really think about it if someone is playing as a pvp hunting player in the main mode they aren t looking to encounter someone who is prepared and willing to fight against them that s what sea dogs mode is for they want someone who s unprepared they want an unfair fight they want to fight someone who doesn t consent to the competition again i used to hate the players but that s humanity people have dark sides and want to do dark things to other humans i blame the devs who s refusal to acknowledge the constant insistence by the community that they want to be free of these bullies can only be interpreted as an endorsement of said bullying they created this entire game as a vehicle to get money out of those bullies so i cannot fundamentally un recommend this game enough this is a despicable project
