2023 this game is fun you get to dig up gold fight skeletons fish it looks nice has good sound design and music has a relaxing game feel that lets even sitting on a boat doing next to nothing not feel boring and you get to have a hook hand however the games pvp is 48 over in 30 seconds 48 takes 15 minutes to resolve and 4 passable but still inferior to most multiplayer pvp experiences no there is no way to turn it off unlike other pvevp games there is a mode coming in december of this year that allows one to be in a private server but many features are removed and it s supposed to be an extended tutorial also there s cannonballs that can prevent your cannons from working cause your anchor to drop or just flood a bunch of your ship along with this is chainshot that has a large hitbox and can break your sails reducing your speed or outright stopping you if all sails are broken most fights are spamming both of these until someone sinks and there s bombs but they only work if no one shoots you before you can carry the thing over there s sword play that feels like your attacks are missing even if they hit and guns two are worse than the blunderbuss because that can insta kill someone if you re close if that sounds like an awful time you can just pass on this game now the game has such a hostile community that most players associate any ship flying the rainbow flag with actual nazis and racist 14 year olds imagine having such an awful community that something as pog as gay rights is seen as a dark omen also you ll be told to get good regardless of performance as will everyone around you including whoever is berating you doing any work to get loot leaves your ship the thing that s more important than your individual life vulnerable to ambushes because you aren t on the damn thing losing your ship has a high chance of rendering any work done in the past however many hours useless to help prevent this one person per crew is unable to play the video game and instead sits on the boat for the entire game looking at an empty ocean for other ships and if they see one everyone has to stop what they re doing and defend the boat spamming the magic balls and chain shot fun due to 0 matchmaking precautions you can be match up with a group of children that just installed nearby a group of day one legends who could 1v4 in their sleep and vice versa no one has fun when this happens there is a designated pvp mode people don t really like it so queue times are long and many people playing don t like pvp and are just there for the cosmetics so even if you find a match it might be against someone who will insta sink themselves to grind xp so they can get hats there s mmr here so at least sometimes you ll get a good fight good being a relative term this game actually has such god awful player vs player everything that people have been begging for a pve mode since launch independent of one another the die hard fans of this game are repulsed by that idea and will be upset upon hearing it like i wanna talk about the other parts but the game is well made in that crossing paths with another ship is inevitable so every activity is mixed with pvp so awful that even the people that like it admit that every game does it better and can only defend it by calling it unique sea of thieves is a passable pirate sandbox with other people being a feature grafted on after launch and for a multiplayer game that sucks big time
