2016 gta is a great game i really enjoyed playing it on singleplayer and completing all missions however if you intend to play it online which i don t recommend you should be really careful right now i just got banned but did not use any cheat or did anything wrong i was in a heist and out of the blue i got the message your account was used in violation of our terms of service and or eula as a result your account has been suspended from playing gta online on pc for 30 days in addition to being suspended all gta online characters progress and inventory on pc will be reset later i found out people are getting banned because they were using some softwares like discord teamspeak bandicamfraps obs xsplit i was using discord to chat with friends and was recording the game with xsplit so i guess this was the reason for the ban then i opened a ticket to explain the situation and thought that everything was going to be ok but i got an automated message that said all gta online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed and my ticket was closed nice customer service 10 10thanks rockstar
