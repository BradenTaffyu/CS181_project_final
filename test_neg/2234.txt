2022 with over 900 hours on apex on origin and 400 hours on steam i can confidently say that i wouldn t recommend this game to newer players with the amount of smurfs highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies even as a prestige level 112 theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at now i know most of you will say thats just a skill issue but when its in every single match it gets quite annoying another issue is apex s skill based match making the concept is simple you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you however apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level i hope this review is helpful sincerely a concerned player
