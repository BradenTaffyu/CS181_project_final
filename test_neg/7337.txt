the optimization is awful running on a fairly high end pc and in any kind of settlement my frames plummeted also not being able to start a new save file i wouldn t care about their microtransactions as much if they weren t shoved down your throat so hard edit so i appreciate that they are adding a new game option and that they ve taken steps to make some of the mtx items more widely available in game the optimization is killing me though it s playable but very jarring when i m used to being able to run cyberpunk and the like on max settings without issue once that is address i will happily change my review to positive because the game itself really good
