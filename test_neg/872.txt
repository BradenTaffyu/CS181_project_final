2019 yea cheaters suck not the biggest problem though smurfs are ridiculous literally the same as cheaters to lower level players and yet no plans to do anything about them that one guy who got 50 kills and 2 deaths in your last game he was just having a good game totally nothing wrong with putting you up against that oh also we re gonna do it again next game honestly the game is ok casual sucks but competitive is a occasionally good time especially with friends though i only keep playing because i have an unhealthy video game addiction tearing my life apart but that s beside the point the game as is is not fun it is not fair balanced or even remotely logical loads of the guns need reworks and the whole competitive elo thing is broken 10 10 voice acting would go sneaky beaky again just in a different game
