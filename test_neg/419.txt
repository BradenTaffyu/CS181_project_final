2015 community is ruining this game i live in russia and happen to play on russian servers this is incredibly awful experience i must say russians are the cancer of this game they are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others i wish csgo would cost like 30 50 on steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of in it i wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn t help because russians are everywhere it saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting csgo because of it i can t enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40 60 minutes despite the outcome of the match i still feel because they trashtalk 24 7 and rarely able to play this game ps i must notice that there is like 5 of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot not all of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others these guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad
