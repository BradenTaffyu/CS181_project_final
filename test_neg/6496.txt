2018 the game itself is a easy to understand easy to get into ideal the killer and survivors are fun the maps are good minus a fewthe commuinty can be toxic but overall really love and enjoy the game and we have supported it through many a error sadly these errors have stack up for me and i can not in good faith give this game a thumbs up for the below reasons1 balance there is so little balance the ideal is to be like a scary hide and go seek but instead it feels like a game of tag your out but witha kid who wont leave and claim you never tagged him the killers feel like scooby doo killers who always miss and cant catch the survivors and the survivors feel like pro track running jocks even though some of them are supposed have a limp 2 bugs the devs are constantly making new and newer bugs for both killers and survivors i even remember when they were banning people for a bug they made themselfs3 lack of dedicated servers this is a personal complain but if they could make servers so we could have a minimum latancy like 50 70 every game that be so good however you can get anywhere from 50 300 ping from game to game there is also a trick where killers can make the game lag and killers never lag4 characteristics this is another personal one all survivors feel and act like the same person they have no unique stats or skills nor perks as the devs thought it be a good ideal to be able make perks teachable thus ending uniqueness and is one the major reasons this game is inbalancedi will rewrite this review if they ever fix this damn game
