2021 it s nice looking and seems fun for a while until you realize its an endless grind which is excusable because most games are like that now what sucks about sea of thieves is the player base even if you have nothing on your ship and sail up to say hello to someone you ll be met with some 12 year old on his xbox who thinks sending you to the ferry over and over and sinking your ship while you don t even fight back is fun to which he ll probably tell you to get good or something similar as it takes him 10 minutes to sink your ship with fire my point is the games fun with friends but most every other multiplayer interaction you have will make you want to quit the game also to add salt to my wounds the linux support for this game is terrible and will make you constantly restart your game which takes much longer than it should just to start playing not to mention if you crash you ll have to do it all over again
