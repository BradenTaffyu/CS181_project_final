2021 product received for free tldr don t play online but allow me to elaborate thank me for playing the game to write this for you allow me to begin throughout my almost 100 hours playing the game i ve already seen a lot and the majority is bad constant griefers modders are a dime a dozen literally never found a single session without atleast 1 2 they can be nice occasionally but the majority of them i ve seen were malicious either they spawn stuff attached to your character that prevents you from doing most if not all forms of movement exploding everyone and using a mod to blame a specific person with it affects the victims stats and at one point i was completely hit offline for hours if you can struck by the luck gods and not get into a session with a cheater you will either run into someone who ruins the fun for everyone else for entertainment or the occasional person who is in godmode via glitch but not cheating there is a small bit of fun that can be found in public session but nothing how it was when i played on 360 in 2015 the game has changed to whoever has the most amount of money will be the victor in any fight since literal flying bikes with missiles exist or the ability to instantly kill anyone from anywhere from a secure location orbital cannon now if you have friends to play with you could always go to a invite only session to enjoy it and have the chance to experience the fun of gta online but sadly a lot of stuff requires you to be in a public session just for them to work the majority of which being sources of making money if you skipped to the end and want the short answer here it is gta online has been completely ruined by the lack of communication between rockstar and it s community you can practically get away with modding nowadays hell even i did for the entire 100 hours i used it to avoid griefers and used it for self enjoyment never killed anyone the pvp aspect takes skill and throws it out the window 2 10
