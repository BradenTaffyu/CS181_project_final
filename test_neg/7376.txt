update wanted to include a brief rant about the state of dragons dogma 2 since capcom obviously pushed this product out way too early the game seems only half finished the story is barely there and it is extremely hard to care or even follow it s just so meaningless the weapons are lacklaster and all of them are available at any blacksmith weaponsmith npc yes there is no merit to explore and tackle challenging bosses encounters there s literaly nothing to gain other than xp in a game that is basically built on immersion it s sad the weapon variety screams how unfinished this game really is some of the weapon types don t even have elemental options and every single new weapon you find is basically just an upgrade downgrade there is a clear difference in numbers and almost zero special effects to consider just go with the flow and buy a new one each time you want to feel stronger verdict dragons dogma 2 is 3 10 one of the saddest single player time wasters with a great foundation but in an absolutely unfinished state i d suggest supporting capcom and its corporate incompetence by buying it under 15 or buy something that at the very least its publisher cares about dragon s dogma 2 is an absolute mess to the point where i cannot even blame capcom for getting away from the traditional gaming culture and joining the ranks of ea blizzard and many other beloved companies who compete at destroying their product at a large scale with cash shop and low life quality simply to abuse an already beloved title from back in the day when their name meant something the performance is terrible to the point where a frozen screen is part of the gameplay capcom also encourages players to not get invested in their game it randomly saves your progression overriding your previous save file and there is only one one time i wanted to redo a timed quest that saved instantly the moment i failed i tried to load my save from the inn when i realized i lost 6 hours of progression it was my bad not realizing that campfire is not part of this feature however since they went with this approach for absolutely no reason i feel like blaming them for intentionally wasting their players time effort and will to play any further the story feels like an unfinished university project that was started the day before without any memorable moments characters or real action and threat it s simply about kill that thing then bring that other thing there is absolutely zero drive in the player to put effort into the goal their characters want to achieve other than reaching the end of the play through tho simply uninstalling seems to be the better choice among players the dialogs are the most ridiculous thing i have ever experienced within a game they introduced a new old feature awkward silence well as long as the player doesn t manually start the next sentence or accidently skips conversations because it is hard to tell when it s over
