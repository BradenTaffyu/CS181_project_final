2016 so the game was great i had a blast playing online with my friends i wasted 250 hours of my life in this game i thought maybe i would get to play more now you may wonder why i don t reccomend this game here it is rockstar is a blantantly terrible company that bans people from the game that were accused but never actually did this past week i recieved a permanent ban from the game because i was near a modder causing chaos and someone falsely accused me and reported me the very next day i got the ban i sent in a support ticket even said the modder s name that the report was meant for and the response i got was all bans are final decisions and cannot be appealed keep in mind their support tickets have an option to ask for a ban appeal why make it an option if you refuse to do it 8 10 if you play in private lobbies with your friends1 10 if you play online with randoms
