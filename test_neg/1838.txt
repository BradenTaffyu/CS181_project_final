2022 update i ve not played this game since launch week i kinda want to but the campaign is so tedious it puts me off of the game entirely because that s all it has right now please please don t buy it in this state also you still cant alt tab like a lot of reviews are saying the drm sucks there are also a ton of glitches in game from unit pathfinding to ui issues some of the changes to ui don t even make sense mandalores video gets into all that though the game clearly needed more time in the oven loading into battles i get tooltips for races that aren t even in the game yet tomb kings most often the nonsense of not launching with blood effects or even blood dlc is infuriating and kinda kills the canon of the game there are also just little annoyances like the intro video starting whenever you want to start a new campaign or that the game launches into the news tab instead of the main menu i wanna like it and i reckon in about a year i will hopefully we wont have to spend another 50 to get to that point and ca can address these issues with patches asap but i don t really know how game development works post launch so i ll not be holding my breath if you haven t bought it already please just give it a few months at least
