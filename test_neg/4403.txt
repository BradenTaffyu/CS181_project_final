2023 the duviri update is the largest identity crisis of genre blending i ve seen in a game fly around picking roguelite talents that all break your character scaling doing repetitive mmo style miniquests to finish 6 mission objectives and fight the same boss from the introduction over and over and you do this flying a thestral from harry potter with bad controls in a scuffed elden ring open world just why the best part of the update which is using frames and weapons you don t own are locked away behind the overly long intro which is the only new player friendly change i can find don t get me wrong warframe itself is a cool game to play around in but this update is not from what i experienced a fresh start and is incredibly poorly designed
