2022 i enjoyed this game for a while things changed the game did not get better there are several issues that players with many more hours than i have will address and likely already have in videos on youtube the developer q a in late january left much to be desired from the developers they have more of an attitude to ignore existing concerns they are well aware of and instead seem to verbalize their lack the understanding of what makes their own game fun rather than accept the criticism internalize it and make the game better they resort to petty retaliation at the players who voice their criticism revoking the cosmetic items from the account of one of these voices under the lie of harassing a member of the development team is nothing shy of blatant pettiness without criticism these developers have no idea of what changes will keep this game alive or push the rest of the dwindling playerbase to vhs and alternatives yet to come frankly the developers lack of understanding of their own game is a big concern for the future of this game notably their attitude towards their latest mmr system and not knowing what is actually skillful in their own game and thus deserving of an increase in ranking within the skill based match making system high rank means nothing the high rank is full of sweaty competitive teams cheaters new players who manage to survive every game by avoiding the killer entirely but couldn t help the team to save their life and the best players but chances are you get matched with cheaters and or new players against a killer with 6000 hours there is no real incentive to climb the ranks yet you do anyways because you never lose ranking only gain with enough games everyone reaches high ranking only to have more difficult games that absorb your entire focus yet provide less fun a lot of changes need to happen to the game and the developers attitude sadly it just feels like this game i once enjoyed has fallen due to some complacency and cockiness ignoring the repeated concerns voiced by the community and waving it away with lies or some goofy explanation that reflects a glaring misunderstanding of the game is not the way for this game to evolve or even maintain the playerbase i for one am uninstalling not because i dislike the game or don t enjoy it not because i side with one influencer or another not because i hate bhvr or any of the independent developers that staff it simply because i do not like the direction this game is heading i played to have fun and i m not having fun with this game in its current state ignoring important changes that would make this game fun again is unfortunately a common occurrence a massive concern for me is the developers paper thin skin getting defensive and hostile towards its players rather than internalizing the criticisms that could make this game great if i ever wanted to stream dbd on my own channel the hostility against criticism has convinced me i m better off steering clear lest i attract their wrath and they delete all of my dlcs and cosmetics from my account
