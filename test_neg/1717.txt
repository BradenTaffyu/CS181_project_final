2023 i love this game i have spent hundreds of hours with it and thousands with its predecessors and i will keep playing and having fun with this one even after this negative review still i am writing this negative review in the hopes to warn everyone of the negative turn this game is taking and to make my voice heard so that it might improve in the future and i can hopefully update this to positive so the game is a mess it s been 18 months since release and what a cluster it has been the amount of bugs is through the roof and ca puts more emphasis on putting out dlc than to adress these sometimes gamebreaking bugs the big joke beeing whenever a dlc and patch drops that is suppost to improve upon things the newly added content adds even more bugs the list of known issues ca puts out has barley changed since the game launched add on this their delusiounal dlc pricing and there is little good faith left that they will make this a good game at some point in the past couple of years they have increased their prices for dlcs multible times that is or rather was fine with me inflation is a thing and we got more and better quality dlc content so these increases where justified for me i own every dlc for all 3 warhammer total war games except forges of the chaos dwarfs and of course my motivation to write this review the shadows of change dlc the content price ratio is abysmal it even gets worse when you compare it to older dlc no amound of new faction mechanics justifies a 150 price increase they don t fix game breaking bugs or take 3 to 12 months time to do it and then try to sell less content for 150 the price they will keep doing so unless the community takes a stand against it vote with your wallet people or it will only get worse from here on ps if you allready own the game use the community bug fix mod it s a game changer and a shame that we need it because ca dropped the ball
