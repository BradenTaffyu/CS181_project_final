2018 i need to get my opinion reccomendation out here fair warning this might seem like a huge review but i hope it helps out of all of the times and hours i have played gta v it s still a good and fun game to play i can t say too much about single player however on multiplayer online mode with all of these updates coming out it seems like everyone is getting banned online for doing nothing whether you are modding or innocent it doesnt matter at all innocent people are getting banned for something that another person has done that is out of their control example modder dropping tons of money to player even if you do the tiniest bit of grinding and pull out a shopping spree with friends rockstar will just think that you re hacking because they will think you somehow magically pulled out 3 6m out of your crotch to pay for a luxary apartment with nice decorations worst part about this is you are unable to appeal your ban because it s a final decision by them rockstar will rob you for your money customer support sucks because when i tried to get support from a legit person instead of getting an automatic message they just threw out deleted my support ticket like it was nothing when i just asked why bans are non appealable and pointed out to them that their eula policies are a little out of date that is not a way to treat customers seriously as of right now 10 30 2018 when i m typing this review they havent updated their tos for almost 1 year now rockstar will swallow your money just like any other gaming communities that do not give 2 about you rockstar expects you to call them a gaming business i will just call them a fraud company that produces pay to win video games just like ea for most people this was once a great game but nowdays it s just a huge disappointment with a big fan base i guess it s a good thing that i purchased this for cheap when it was on sale but do not pay for this game at full price i wish i can file for a refund but sadly i can t do that if you are looking for a fun game to play with friends that is similar to gta v play purchase garry s mod
