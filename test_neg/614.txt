2023 the same company that monetizes achievement showcases will just go and delete your achievements in the very game they publish interesting business model so after not even playing cs go for years i come to find that instead of just launching cs 2 with a separate app id and letting cs go remain in everyone s libraries they just changed the same app id and decided to up and remove 150 achievements that i spend 100 hours earning there are literally dozens of other ways they could have launched cs 2 while carrying over everyone s inventory while not totally dismantling the accomplishments people earned in cs go instead whatever genius is running this operation decided the best decision would be to use the same app id and just demolish everyone s achievements they had for years there is no way anyone with a working brain could think this is a good idea it has no benefit to either group of people people who do care about achievements have now just been absolutely robbed of their memories and will have zero interest in trusting that any time money spent on any future games on this platform would be worth it as it has been proven that they will just take it away people who don t care about achievements well they don t care either way the one area that steam continues to lose out to consoles achievements and now valve themselves reinforce that steam is not the gaming platform for achievement hunters i don t see why anyone would want to give money to a company that has proven they will take away your things achievements cost time not money something more valuable i am very disappointed
