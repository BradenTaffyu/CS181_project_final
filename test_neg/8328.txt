2020 early access review far too many non intuitive one shot kills on your character making the game feel unrewarding and frustrating its typical to spend hours on a single run and abruptly die from something you wouldnt think or couldnt foresee killing you the game is fun at first but becomes unsatisfying the farther you progress you never really gain a sense of power or reward instead you gain an increasing sense of fragility and that you are wasting your time
