2015 it was a great game for awhile but after the whole on sale joke and now the complete random banwave of innocent people i m just very dissapointed rockstar doesn t even allow people that have been banned to make tickets because on the support forum their accounts are also flagged so they can t even post anything it s disgusting to see such a big game business acting so overconfident and not caring at all about their player base let alone the fact that they can t even properly protect their game in online play not before and not even after the banwave for a game of 50 that s completely unacceptable
