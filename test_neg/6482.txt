2021 edit this review was made for an old version of the game problems were partially solved still game s toxic af i recommend against it if you appreciate your mental health just a bit the feeble mind of the community can t understand the gargantuan sized brain of bhvr i mean they seem to know what the community wants even though they cry out loud against it also here is a list of problems that were reported and passed the ptb survivors now look like they are preparing for a picnic instead of running from a killer previous ui elements are now dispersed along the screen with the previous ui you would collect information from one quick glance over the bottom left now you need to scan the entire screen to get the same information hitbox s size are now inversely proportional to community approval roll a d20 to see if it hits advantage applied progressing in the rank system actually makes you regress in the rank system i e gaining a pip makes you actually lose the pip if you are hooked game will play dance music won t decide to play a fade in or a fade out for current soundtrack so it will play both effects at random intervals as a spectator if a survivor is hooked music will decide to die until you close the game perk dead hard is now triggered 1 2 seconds after the player actually wants to use it in loading match screen players could make the server angry and get disconnected in tandem spectating a survivor that is escaping makes the game enter into a tantrum and freeze your screen this does not produce a crash but you have to close the game as it will not let you play anymore analyzing it more reflexively this may be intentional to be the stress factor in the horror tag survivors may phase into a wall and become stuck there survivor won t be able to move and can t be hit by the killer making the game take itself hostage until the survivor or the killer decides to uninstall the game as a survivor if you don t escape you will not progress in the ranking system and guess what you will not escape too often making higher ranks of survivors more sweaty and scummy timer progression is now displayed as a shade of bright red over bright red
