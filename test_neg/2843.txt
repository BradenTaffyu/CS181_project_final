2017 if you want to buy it for the singleplayer only go ahead it is great diverse and has a lot to offer if you are looking for a good multiplayer experience skip this they have locked down the mp a lot to allow for the sale of their microtransaction cards it is a grindy mess goes against the theme of the game you don t steal cars you have to buy them to own them the expensive one everyone would want you get punished for killing and destroying players and their vehicle in mp price inflation because of the microtransaction is a constant issue and the game without paying is grindy as all get out there is no online mode that allows you to mess with the the game you can t for example have fun going on a rampage because the game actively punishes you both for setting you to be aggressive and also monetarily everything costs money weapons are locked behind a ranking system plus a cost so when you are new and try to get into online you will probably get killed by people that already have those unlocked with no recourse armored vehicles that cannot be destroyed without explosives will be the bane of your existance and of course they tried to kill off the modding community so no do not support them if you are interested in multiplayer you can buy it for mp if you have a lot of time and are completely bored out of your mind because it will take you forever to get things done
