2015 i love this game but what rockstar did with the summer sale broke my heart i have friends who waited for this sale waited for this game to go on sale specifically and what do you know day one 25 off but wait what s this no it s not 25 off it s a filthy lie a manipulative trick to get you to buy 20 dollars worth of in game money meaning in the end you save about a dollar fifty again i love gtav but until they do something to fix this shady buisness behavior do not buy this game it is not worth it you can be better rockstar i know you can come on
