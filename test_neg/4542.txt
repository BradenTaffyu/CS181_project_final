2023 163 hours 163 i want to love this game i really do the gameplay the lore everything design wise here is fantastic what breaks this game for me it s timer hell crafting a weapon wait 12 hours crafting a warframe wait 12 hours if you make all the parts at once and then an additional three days to put those parts together want to increase your rank so you can use better weapons and go on more interesting missions 12 hour wait in between rank up tests want to increase your standing with a faction you find interesting there s a cap and you have to wait a day for that cap to reset the only time i ve ever seen a game try so hard to make me not play it was when freemium mobile gaming became popular and a ton of games had play timers or an energy system that locks the entire game away after you ve played it for about as long as a bathroom break at work might not be so bad if you re the sort to play the game for only a few hours a day but i got that tism that hyperfixation vigor i have the capability to sit down at a game and grind the hell out of it for hours upon hours i abhor the concept that i can t sit down on a weekend or other day i don t have to work on something and not just be able to do what i want with my time this game has the gall to tell me how long i can play it for and what is and isn t worth my time with so many mechanics if i want to spend 16 hours grinding out deimos so i could get max standing all at once because i really really like the entire area i should be able to without some arbitrary internal clock saying these people will like you more if you leave them for 24 hours and come back to then give them more ore you ve mined animal tags you spent all that time hunting for or all the fish you ve spear hunted i feel like there s a near perfect game in here waiting to burst out of its shell but everyone outside the graphic design gameplay and writing sections of development have mobile game brainrot
