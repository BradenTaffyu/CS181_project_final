2016 updated review with so many more hours this game deserves another review oh boy where to begin i wish rockstar would ve stopped developing their game after last review but sadly they ve added more content that speaks to me they really hate their own game and how so your average opponent online is using flying cars and scooters with infinite homing rockets the cheaters are also still part of the content and it s a bit funny that they are no longer the biggest problem recent popular cheats include occasionally everyone in a session getting teleported to a random players house where they blow up the street is covered with random game models or a player with level 8000 that doesn t take any damage spawn kills you repeatedly until you quit the game because passive mode does nothing with them which is of course great fun i have to say if you are planning to coop all the online heists with your friends don t with casino heist you are forced to play prep missions in an online session just so that you can experience the great homing rockets that annihilate that garbage truck you need to slowly drive from point a to b the amount of underestimation of players is also amazing casino heist starts by you driving all they way to the opposite side of the map and once you get there the objective was stolen and you have to drive all the way back to where you started from the money grind in online is also so disgustingly slow that you probably have more fun just taking extra hours at work instead the grind is also balanced like so a daily random wheel of fortune can give you more money than grinding 3 hours of activities where other players can blow you up and you then earn nothing rockstar has also made it very clear that grind is all an online game should be until they find that point where they could get you spend more actual money on shark cards don t waste your time play something else don t buy the next online old review gta v is a solid single player experience and i have had lots of fun in both single player and multiplayer but today i cannot recommend it to anyone if they are planning to play multiplayer when it comes to multiplayer rockstars ability to create working multiplayer systems is very amateurish i tolerated the bad net code and awful connect logics just because the content of the game was awesome with the free dlc updates it could be even better could be recently the amount of cheaters online makes it downright unplayable be warned they do not cheat to get money or items they use whatever they can to ruin your online session rockstar has clearly shown what the companys view is on the subject of this trolling they dont care as long as they still make money its all fine next time rockstar publishes a game its your turn to show how much you care if you do buy this game make sure you have friends who play it and never ever stay in open sessions longer than you have to use private sessions and play coop with your friends
