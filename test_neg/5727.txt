2023 played since beta i look at this game and i dont even recognize what this is i paid for a tactile house clearing shooter all i got was a game that dumps heros into itself every season and screws over its player in the name of balance the name tom clancy used to mean a game was going to be tactile now they just throw it on any that ubisoft doesn t believe will sell this game could have been huge but got screwed over by the developers im sorry to everyone that bought this game back in the day for the original dream they were selling you never got delivered on the product they showed
