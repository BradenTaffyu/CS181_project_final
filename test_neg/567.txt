2023 to be honest cs2 s performance is completely below expectations after such a long polishing process the outcome is quite disappointing ignoring the existing bugs which i assume will be fixed in future updates the main issues for me are the strange feel of the weapons and odd feedback on headshots giving a waxy sensation the game s visuals perhaps due to my unfamiliarity seem tiring with overly bright brightness despite expecting to adapt quickly to lower graphics settings as in cs go it s evident that the experience lacks the satisfying feeling of the go era lastly it feels like cs2 is leaning towards cf and while some added features like throwable monitoring aren t necessarily bad they seem unnecessary adding an extra layer that might be considered superfluous ultimately having spent my entire university period with this game i hope cs2 can carry the legacy and i trust valve to refine it we ve seen the significant improvements brought by source 2 and i believe cs2 has substantial untapped potential
