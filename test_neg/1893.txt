2022 ca learned nothing from wh2 firstly the ui it s ugly it s pretty much all one color which makes distinguishing literally anything aheadache second and by far the worst the campaign it plays like they did no testing on it instead of making the game legitimately fun in a challenging way they just make the pc cheat going into tzeanches realm the pc knows the path straight through going to papa nurgle pc takes no attrition and now before they ve even finished balancing the game they are trying to sell dlcs no hate to the developers here but ca gave us a flop even after the community gave them all the feedback they needed from wh2 to make a great capstone in the end all ca care about is your sweet cash no matter how good they get this game it released in the state it did and will always be just another mediocre cash grab
