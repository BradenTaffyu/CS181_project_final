2023 list of things that in my opinion killed the game i once loved the communityback in the day i met some good people on this game people i still talk to to this very day long after we stopped playing these days i can confidently say that the people who play this are not human but angsty teenage goblins who consider team killing to be the funniest joke ever this eliminates any hope for a decent solo queue experience only play with at least a duo the aesthetic is lost in time nothing to be said that isn t already known this game used to be the tacticool wonder that ubisoft brought back from the dead one albino astronaut chick later and this game is more fantasy than anything the grindunless you re buying the season passes grinding 50 000 credits for a new operator each operator is not fun not fun at all i ve calculated about 40 50 hours per unlock some are more optimistic with a 75 hours estimate either way this system is obviously designed to make you buy season passes cosmeticscosmetics are fun but the game s focus on them is to an extent i ve never seen before in any game the battle passes the packs the everything really this is how they get money i get it but holy motherf ing sh t for the love of god lay off with the consoomerism why does every game needs to be the equivalent of a funko pop collection
