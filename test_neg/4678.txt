2022 to start off apparently i am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign i feel like i can write about this game now if you like mw2019 or onwards you ll probably like this game but if you are a fan of the golden age of cod its time to stop buying these new cod games it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one they are pandering to us the old guard of cod haha and will continue to push this disgusting micro transaction live service model of modern gaming you probably don t need me to tell you it ain t like it used to be campaign was fine some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy multiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but ttk is fast possibly fastest we have seen graphics are great feels like it runs better than previous new cods regardless its more of the same safe new cod that you probably either already love or hate if i could give this a score out of 10 i would probably say 7 10 but it would score higher if there weren t so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers but loses points for predatory marketing practices why did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous cods on the chance that you are new to cod and have not purchased one before don t start here and avoid giving this company your money probably gonna keep playing but that s only really because of halo infinite and battlefield 2042 flopping hard yay modern aaa gaming
