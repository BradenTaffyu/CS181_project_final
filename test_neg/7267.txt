edit combat and exploration is absolutely fantastic and if that s the kind of thing you like like i do this game is for you and that s frankly the bulk of content in this game most other things though have a noticeable lack of polish mostly relating to story events and triggers escort ai pathing and journal ambiguity especially later on that i hope they fix over time if you re used to playing jank games that won t bother you too much but generally speaking i wouldn t flat out recommend this game it has a strong start but a middling end the core gameplay loop of combat exploration needs to be your draw which unfortunately becomes less of a challenge later on edit seems that they are working towards fixing issues and addressed the initial pain point i describe below on release started the game made a character once i actually started the game and saw how the characters moved i didn t like the character wanted to restart delete that save to try again turns out you can t restart your save file turns out you can t actually edit your characters appearance if such basic qa pain points were missed at the very start of the game i do not have high hopes for the rest of it
