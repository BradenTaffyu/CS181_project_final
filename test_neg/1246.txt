2022 quick summary first i ve played every game from fromsoft starting with dark souls and i view bb as the best i have roughly 1400 hours across the series and have done everything in this game elden ring fails as a souls game and it is with this opinion i would not recommend despite that it could be a great open world game it has fantastic visuals and the world is interesting sometimes but it has awful repetitive bosses copy pasted enemies with different coats of paint zero direction for the player a useless crafting system and unrewarding exploration the story is easily missable as the exposition dump character only appears at certain graces and only if you notice the talk to her button appeared i normally don t have an issue with the story in these games as the environment and item descriptions do the telling but not knowing why i need to become the elden lord or how the world got the way it did kinda sapped my motivation which consisted of exploring and find a new thing from what i can tell its the same thing as dark souls with fire being integral big trees and really boring naming convention eld erd every name starts with a m seriously we have marika mohg mohgwyn malenia melina miquela millicent miriel and runes instead of souls not having a scooby where to go is par for the course with the series but is exponentially worse with the open world as the graces only point towards the nearest lord not the medallion you might need some legacy dungeons are horrific stormveil comes to mind i couldn t imagine being a new player and experiencing that fresh hell as the game encourages you to go there first instead of the nice southern area to get 3 tears having three secret areas within itself is some dumb design the consecrated snowfields the haligtree and the blood area can be missed despite the fact they each hold one of the lord bosses that drops a great rune the reward for exploring is pitiful see that item behind the illusionary wall and protected by a hard mob it s a crafting flower that has an infinite respawn area you just killed a hard boss useless ash summon for you 90 of the armour i had was farmed by enemies or bought from merchants i honestly think dark souls 2 has a better enemy variety which was lambasted as dudes in armour in this game when i go to a different area it is the exact same knights and footsoldiers in different coloured armour and composition of allies i get that some enemies have to be reused but seriously i should not see them in every area oh and some reskinned mobs from previous games make a visit like the demi humans are reskinned monkeys from sekiro the world looks phenomenal especially the underground environments like nokron despite some goofy stuff that might be a reference but takes me out of it like the nights cavalry aka nazgul godfrey joestar blaidd who is literally guts the crafting system brings nothing of value to the formula i think i crafted one stack of arrows and an item discovery boost as arrows can be bought and are of better quality buildup resist items were never necessary firebombs and the myriad of variants were borderline useless as hitting the thing with a stick is quicker and less likely to get you punished for missing usable items only challenge runs should be more interesting now the bosses are horrific there are multiple slightly beefed up mobs with a health bar and name gank fights happen too often to artificially pump up the difficulty some bosses are too big for their arenas so you fight the camera tree spirits suck some can fly so high you can t see them so dragons consist of please dive bomb me don t breathe fire most unique bosses have fast high damage attacks glue like tracking multiple distance closing attacks most standard attacks have aoe effects think twin princes overhead from ds3 or lawrence from bb some form of delayed attack like the nameless king now can you see the issue bosses went from most of the time playing on similar rules as the player as big weapon long reach big damage slow even bloodborne to a lesser extent understood this like ludwig aoe attacks used to be limited to 1 attack that had an easy tell a fast backhand attack would do little damage but now borderline one taps even if you overleveled vigour not a single boss was enjoyable no memorable greats like o s artorias gwyn maria or friede gael soul of cinder genchiro fume knight ludwig i went through this game praying for a good boss and the closest i got was malenia who while fast and stupidly hard hitting felt fair until she spammed one bs attack killing her was pure luck that she never used that move every other souls game i looked forward to the next boss and learning the fight like a dance now it was sheer dread as to what flavour of lawrence will kill me this time with bloodborne being my favourite game high speed gameplay is what i love but this game suffers for it as you don t have the mobility to keep up with the bosses apparently the optimisation is also rubbish worked fine with me but your mileage may vary this game was not meant for solo players it was very clearly designed around co op and spamming ash summons which goes against everything i knew about the series i honestly do not want to play it again unlike the others where i was excited for ng now because i went against the almighty miyazaki i expect to see a shill in the comments hitting me with git gud or you have x hours how can you not recommend please do not disappoint me
