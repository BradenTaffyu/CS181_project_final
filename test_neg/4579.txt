a game about grinding for the sake of grinding warframe is plagued with a dev team with a poor sense of direction they make decisions and add content that feels out of line with their game s direction sometimes even verging on bizarre it s a game that demands a ton of investment and can be fun for a while but after a time you will come to realize that this investment leads you nowhere special the endgame is weak and more or less indistinguishable from the rest of the game and veteran players will quickly find themselves bored unless they are easily entertained by nature at one point there was challenging endgame content in the form of 8 player raids but those have long since been removed after the devs deemed them in need of a rework they were promised to return in some form later on but after six years there is no evidence of them coming back instead we got what fishing horses open world how these things fit into the game as it was i ll never understand the devs have done this with beloved content and gameplay mechanics many times and will likely continue to do so moving forward i reinstalled it recently to check the state of the game and sate my curiosity disappointed with what i found i have resigned to let this game go for good if you want a complex enriching experience from your games and time investment by my reckoning warfarm is not the place to find it i strongly advise looking for another place to sink your time even if you ve got too much of it on your hands congratulations on enduring my rant just figured i d offer some last words before i uninstall again
