2017 gta 5 has got to be one of my favorite games of the past few years i could care less about the stupid shark cards however what really has me writing a negative review is the recent action take two interactive rockstar s parent company has taken against mods open iv was something i came across fairly recently and i must say it is an excellent fix to getting around the hard to get files from gta s core game one thing to note is that many single player mods from which i have used specifically don t let the user boot into their online persona thus returning the player back to story mode i have to admit that i ve had trouble with r in the past but they should definitly take a second thought about take two and where it ll land their personal reputation thanks for taking the time to read this m9 and like a shark i think this whole thing is a bad idea and for that reason i m out update thank you r for slobbing on that windows knob
