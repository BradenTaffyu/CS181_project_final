2018 grand theft auto vi have never thought that i will write a negative review on game like gta v for a long time it was one of my favorite games but after last ban wave i reconsidered my opinion and i just can not recommend this game to anyone who is considering to buy it for multiplayer or is already playing if you still do not have this game and you just want to play singleplayer do not hesistate and go for it singleplayer alone is worth those money now about multiplayer grind here is bad it has lot of bugs so many endless loadings you need friends to really enjoy the game and even with them it will be frustrating experience there are not many things which you could do alone you can not do your businesses on your own private server so you are forced to play with random players because of that it is really frustrating and hard to make any money new updates are worse and worse they cost a lot of money and in the end most of those things are totally useless they do not care about old stuff which is already in the game for example titan could have functional loading bay or cargobob could have magnet rather than that useless hook ban waves which causes suspensions even for legit players yet there are still many moddersstill after all those things the biggest problem is r support i can say that i have never seen worse support it is like talking with robots they are using scripted phrases and in the end they will not help you as a player who got banned without any reason i was trying to get some answers at least i wanted to know what have i done but they will not tell you because you do not have permission to know that the only thing you get is their typical copy paste answer how their anticheat is flawless and you are the one who broke eula rules but which one who knows another thing is that with the ban they also delete your characters because of that i lost my 700h progress so if you are guilty you can prepare yourself that after the ban ends you probably get another one permanent because you can not prevent happening it again without knowing what it caused and if you are really innocent the only thing what you can do is wait after all of this i was just waitting for some statement from rockstar and you know what even though thousands of players were banned falsely after month rockstar did not do any statement they just act like nothing ever happend this is how rockstar appreciate their costumers
