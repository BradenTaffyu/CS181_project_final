2019 great game if you re not colorblind if you re colorblind you will have a lot of trouble you need to be able to distinguish the colors of different fluids and objects which can make the game incredibly difficult it really sucks getting poison immunity and unwittingly jumping into a pool of lava i d definitely have left a positive review if i wasn t colorblind thumbs down because i m colorblind edit still playing this game 100 hours later despite the color based that kills me every once in a while i ve gotten used to the types of monsters that spill different effects and still every once in a while i get tripped up and jump in the wrong pool when i m in a rush i ll revise my review as soon as it becomes colorblind friendly edit oct 19 2020 i came back to the game now that 1 0 has been launched and it s still not colorblind friendly and now i have a complaint that i didn t mention before there s no in game explanation of mechanics which means when you re making a decision on what to upgrade you have to open up a browser and wiki to remind yourself what it does relying on a wiki that you have to alt tab between is not fun it s very tedious and bad gameplay for a full 1 0 version of the game it seems really bad to not fully explain the features in the game
