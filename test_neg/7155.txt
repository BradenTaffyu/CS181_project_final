2015 the game is not unplayable but it is unenjoyable because of how poorly optimized it is my pc does not have top tier specs but it is a decent pc and plays most other current games at hight to ultra settings amd a10 6700 gtx 760 12 gb ram but in black ops 3 campaign all low settings and setting to 720p resolution the game runs at around 30 40 fps with fps spikes down as low as into the single digits which technically does make it unplayable so for the time being i put campaign on hold until if it gets patched on the multiplayer side of things the same issues are present but not quite as bad again forced to run at 720p resolution but able to run at medium settings and run around 50 60 fps but still suffering from random momentary fps drops down to around 30fps and some times random extended periods of 15 fps there is no reason this game couldnt have been optimized better and that my pc couldnt have ran it at 1080p on medium high settings at the least its just flat out a crap pc port beacause the game is cranked out year after year and they know people will buy it because cod otherwise although the game is your typical call of duty plays the same mechanics feel good a few bugs but otherwise fun game play i wish it just ran right so i could actually enjoy playing it i havent bought the last 3 call of duties because of the path activision has taken the franchise down and i was hoping this time would be the right time to get back in obviously things have not changed and i will likely opt out of buying the next itteration of cod now if you want to know a game worth your money that actually plays butter smooth and flawless pick up fallout 4 game is amazing and i am running 60 fps on all ultra settings with the same pc specs that black ops has given me so much trouble on
