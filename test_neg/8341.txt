2021 most runs tend to peter out early on simply because no good spells drop so you re stuck facing continually improving enemies with a stagnating set of tools you can play flawlessly but still struggle flounder and eventually die an unsatisfying death simply due to sheer luck in many games where death is frequent the levels are so short that it doesn t matter however noita is a rogue like and a very long one at that if you want to do any of the interesting things anyway spending hours and hours hunting for spells that might let you stand a chance against the next onslaught only to die from a random explosion is incredibly frustrating worse yet are the many many times where you slowly bleed to death because all of the randomized drops are garbage noita can be exceptionally fun when it works but it rarely does there are a lot of incredible ideas here but it is impossible to really explore those ideas the spell programming gameplay is innovative and fun but held back severely by the randomized drops that often give you the same boring useless garbage a world of secrets and intense challenges would be fun to explore but spending hours and hours and hours repeating the same 4 5 stages just to get there is too tedious to justify ultimately noita does things that i wish more games did but not all at once
