2017 only bought it for zombies campaign story is a joke multiplayer is pay to win with cod points and microtransactions also the m1911 was remastered for multiplayer not for zombies and it s in a supply crate this game really makes me wish activision would go bankrupt edit btw i left my computer on for 3 days straight i went on vacation for a weekend and left it on because i didn t want to lose my progress for the easter egg in gorod krovi
