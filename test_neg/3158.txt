let me preface this that my review is mostly towards gta online gta v single player is a well made game and probably worth the price despite it being 10 years old and having received zero updates or improvements gta online is still a buggy mess after a decade i think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst it has been 10 years and i still get loading screens as if i m on xbox 360 with a hdd it s 2024 and more times than i can count i enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3 minutes before i give up and alt f4 the inventory interaction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use you have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself the phone call system is still obnoxious as ever constantly berated with calls emails texts and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something where is the do not disturb function my mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time can t get my car to me this was an issue in 2013 matchmaking is a joke if you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match you have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone the awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for 5k when there are better ways to make money the money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so it s better to just afk the mission than play original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves i cannot tell you how many times i ve had an error loading into gta online and get sent back to storymode why can t you requeue me rockstar loathes its player base zero communication ever programming cars to swerve into while driving nerf payouts of everything force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them we can buy police cars now but not uniforms i cannot believe it took a decade to add police cars you can keep players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars they even made the police suv a console exclusive arbitrary limits to the number of ceos in an online session you need to be one to do any mission add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now only took 5 years to add but still you have to install rockstar launcher to play horribly unoptimized for online tanks your fps going online from singleplayer poor vehicle diversity max like 5 different car spawns sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back die on a mission and need to retry any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck playing with some people and you exit the lobby good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby not fun just bad game design the economy is still inflated beyond belief 5 million dollars for a police car 2 million for a mustang 400k for a rifle they have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts but you have to be experienced and willing to grind you need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money which is why they have a starter pack you practically need this to play if you are new shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend please don t give rockstar money buy a 100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars this game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions you think csgo or rust has a cheater problem you wouldn t believe the number of cheaters on pc it s basically in the tos that rockstar doesn t care if you use a mod menu they even reward them because they don t ever ban them but will ban you if you do a money glitch god mode glitches never get patched or banned there is zero punishment for cheating every other person is cheating maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop but casually playing in god mode grinding abysmal security for online where modders can get everyone s ip you played a heist and the money was never paid support will tell you to go yourself there isn t even an option for missing money on support they couldn t care less they treat pc like last gen consoles by locking pc out of content on new gen consoles they removed 200 vehicles for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta animals have been added into online for consoles only pc has the best hardware and doesn t get the animals something that should ve been in the game to begin with they just keep adding dlc with more bloat they add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more the missions and heists they do add are pretty good although a lot of them require multiple people to play if rockstar had any competition we would have had gta vi years ago and a much better gta v instead we get this show cautiously optimistic for gta vi rockstar is a shell of its former self the heads of the studio that made rockstar great have left the company
