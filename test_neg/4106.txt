2022 i can t even play the game because it s asking for some random activation code after going through the headache of setting up the social club account that i couldnt care less about i just want to play the game i paid for this was fun back in the day on xbox 360update once i had the game activated i really started enjoying it again i got into online play and became hooked but about every other time i try to get online i get an error via the rockstar social club it is beyond frustrating to perpetually troubleshooting launching the game why does the rockstar launcher have to be its own app it doesn t integrate well at all with all the updates and evolution of this game you think they could focus on a seamless launch this is the best game in the world but unfortunately i can t currently play it i ve tried 10 times to get online today already
