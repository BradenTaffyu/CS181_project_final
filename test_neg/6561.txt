product received for free a massive mistake of a destiny warframe clone 1 gameplay it s pretty much destiny 2 except there s no pvp and all the guns are terribly balanced with only a handful that are actually viable bosses are all massive bullet sponges and there s a bunch of unique enemy spawns that make the game incredibly tedious by giving them boring obnoxious trash like giant invincible bubble or make everyone 30 feet from me 100 invincible unfortunately they decided to not copy warframe s excellent movement system and instead replace it all with a very clunky grappling hook that has a pathetic range randomly stops pulling you 30 of the time has a long cooldown fails to adhere to a lot of surfaces your camera is limited to not be able to look straight up and most tragic of all there s strange void magic that rapidly decelerates you constantly even when you re mid air after accelerating customization for characters and weapons have been copy pasted directly from warframe which would be a big if it wasn t for 2 extreme grinding warframe has a saving grace when it comes to it s grinding whereas you can buy what you want with platinum in game currency don t want to buy platinum using irl money you can earn it in game by trading with other players selling off random things you find or grinding specifically to make the in game currency this does not currently exist in the first descendant nor does player trading in any capacity instead as you may expect of a korean game it has been replaced with give us irl money approach and some absolutely ridiculously bonkers gacha rng dice rolling that locks pretty much every single piece of thing you want behind lootboxes anomalous materials you have to 1 grind for in order to get the lootboxes usually 5 20 drop rate 2 grind some more to actually open them void shard missions rewards 3 5 each you need 35 for each attempt usually 3 pray to god you hit a 6 30 drop rate chance 4 5 times 4 grind all the materials to start crafting the 4 5 components i literally cannot convey through words alone how soul crushingly bad this system is there are rng booster items but they are even more rare at around 1 5 drop rates 3 extreme greed the first descendant has a lot of cool paint jobs you can put on skins unfortunately despite the game showering you with them just by playing normally and completing challenges you can t actually use any because they require a skin to be applied to which are all locked behind cash store purchases except some recently added challenge trash for only some descendants yes they literally paywalled the color your baseline warframe feature the result is that everyone runs around looking 100 identical did you somehow complete the soul breaking grind mentioned above either pay irl money or have fun waiting days for your crafting to actually finish and then a couple of more days waiting for all your forma crystallization catalyst 8 hours each and orokin reactors energy activators 30 hours each to finish yes they stole that from warframe too 4 graphics the game has the potential to look great unfortunately the developers thought it d be really funny to enforce taa temporal anti aliasing a horrible graphical setting that makes everything extremely blurry like someone smeared mineral oil on your screen and adds serious ghosting to every single visible movement here s an in game example of it with every setting on ultra except post processing gpu settings may vary but look at her gold hand it in the setting files people have done this confirmed that it works successfully without causing any issues but the moment it connects to the servers in the menu the game forcefully flicks it back on again no joke here s a video going into detail as to why it s complete trash youtube video this issue is plaguing modern gaming graphics views 923 577 part 2 solutions developer resource join r motionclarity to discuss this issue to find workarounds there s also serious graphical design issues with some abilities like bunny literally flashing a massive reflective ring of lightning every second that gave me such serious eye strain i had to disable reflections and most lighting in the game entirely god knows how many seizures it has caused so far 5 lack of tutorials the first descendant has a lot of systems and intricate things that it expects you to just know the only effort of a tutorial they ve made is adding a trashy text exposition robot that only covers some of the things i can guarantee you that you re going to have to google stuff at least 30 times trying to play this heap of trash 6 bloated design there s so many things in this game that doesn t have to exist i ll make a list 1 phase exchangers a literal trap item you craft in order to level up a gun by using another gun completely useless once you finish the campaign as every item begins to drop at lvl 100 but something you have to spam craft and keep using over and over while you re doing the campaign if you have a gun you really like and also wait for the craft time or pay money or just pick up the higher level guns as they drop and use them for free since they re often way more powerful as well 2 silion the module master an npc you have to spend a solid minute running to at the edge of town in order to do anything module related why does he exist instead of buttons on your module ui i don t know 3 prime hand a thing you go to in order to gain mastery rank whereas your descendant steps on a hand and gets zapped weird since mastery rank is account related and has nothing to do with the descendants themselves if you don t go do this you will have a constant pop up of mastery rank levelup why don t you just level up dynamically like the level on your descendant or season level in order to not break the game pacing i don t know 4 ion accelerators reactors enhancement you make these things to marginally upgrade your reactor for a total skill power increase of about 3 5 at level 100 why 5 elemental resistances posterchild of a feature checklist crammed into this game without any sort of thought even if you get thousands upon thousands of this stuff which is very hard expensive it literally does nothing except marginal 10 20 damage reduction for ruining your descendant modules gear video going over it here youtube video in depth guide on elemental
