2017 gta v was once one of my favorite games for singleplayer why because of the ability to add some really awesome real world cars that other games neglected with openiv rat rods hot rods unique cars honestly i want to point out to take 2 how all the sudden gta v s reviews are rock bottom my feelings go out to openiv team the modders who made some incredible vehicles and the scripters who added immersion to the game update i have heard rockstar has spoken to the lead of openiv and that they may release an update so if they do in fact support the singleplayer modding community and prove to the community that they are on the side of the good modders this review will be changed and all will be forgotten as of now i still want to see what happens
