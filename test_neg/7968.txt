2020 product received for free bottom line this game is a repetitive frustrating and unrewarding time sink the vast open world consists of virtually identical islands inhabited with virtually identical content combat is wooden and boring pvp is basically just a contest to see who has a bigger team every mission quest is either go here kill 5 bad guys or go here and find treasure even the so called tall tales are just very long kill 10 rats type experiences with an ounce of story mixed in it gets incredibly boring and predictable very fast quests are frequently bugged meaning bad guys and treasure do not appear there s no way to tell if a quest is bugged so you may spend 90 minutes looking for something that is not there all of your clothing and equipment is 100 cosmetic meaning there is no in game benefit to changing the default clothing and equipment every single thing you do takes a very long time absolutely everything is tedious for example say you sail around for two hours collecting treasure once you arrive at the port instead of just pressing a sell all treasure button or selling directly from your inventory you have to carry each individual item by hand one at a time to specific people on an island to sell it to a process that is instantaneous in most games takes 20 30 minutes in this one you can very slowly build up reputation with various factions a higher reputation will give you access to additional kill 10 rats type missions and additional clothing and equipment that carry no in game benefit in other words much like how the clothing is cosmetic having a higher reputation is also cosmetic and does not affect your game experience there is no end game to speak of you re literally just re living the tutorial every time you play the more likely outcome to your questing is that you ll spend two hours putzing around scrounging for treasure and then a galleon full of 13 year olds with aimbot will instantly kill you and steal your stuff in 30 seconds to that point every time i tried starting an open crew with 2 or more people i invariably was teamed up with either one person who does not speak english one 10 year old or someone who want to set the ship our ship on fire for just laughs it s a massive multiplayer game that incentivizes you to play solo there is a pvp arena and a pve map the pvp arena is almost always empty the pve map is full of people who are desperately just trying to enjoy pve and a handful of players who just want to torment them is it any wonder people think this community is toxic except that s not really the issue it s that the game rewards people for being jerks the game is toxic not the players
