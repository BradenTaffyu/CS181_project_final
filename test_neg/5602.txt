2016 notes after feb 11th 2016 2 1 patch below also updated on may 3rd 2016 i was an open beta player with the pre purchase of this game i have 178 hours played at this point in time and have achieved platinum rank in ranked play with a 6 0 win loss ratio i m also level 83 and have everything unlocked for each character with most top tier skins purchased with renown these are my credentials in this game just so you know i m not speaking out of my behind this game is an excellent game when it works key word when tactically there isn t anything that i know of out there that competes with this title it s fun can be high low paced and is always very intense the number of ways to defend and attack are almost limitless and it shows during game play when you mess up you re usually punished for it and quickly so one slip can make the tide of the game completely turn against for your favour however i did give this a negative review because of the following this game is terribly inconsistent and often favours the high latency player it also has a list horrible of bugs which people like to exploit often i have decided that i am uninstalling this game and will not play it until ubisoft steps up to the plate and actually starts fixing their game here s a list of frustrations i have with this title being killed by someone not on your screen they re 150 200 ping and have shot you but have not appeared yet though i have experienced this with lower ping players being unable to vault over a shield because the game doesn t show the vault on your screen aka the game forgets to make things vault able if that s a word being killed by players during drone phase in which they re not allowed to escape the building but manage to anyways they plant c4 on your spawn location so when you come to life they blow it up being blinded on a shield by random artifacts and patterns on the glass not just visible to the victim but other players being able to see the obstruction on the shield glass being killed by someone you ve just shot 3 4x in the head then notice their health is only down to 75 on the kill cam any character with any gun is a 1 shot head shot fixed feb 11th 2016 problem since sept 2015 launch being killed by the infamous kapkan no laser no spike trap hidden inside the wall glitch which ubi knows about and still has not fixed since beta being shot through your shield as montagne or blitz fuse recruit in the head with it on full extend facing the enemy being killed in a position that your character is not in because the animations do not match the location of the hit boxes being killed through a concrete wall by a c4 or grenade or other explosive the list goes on and on this is a wonderful game that is being ruined by netcode problems and low tickrate servers my final position on this game is this even if you re playing the perfect strategy that means nothing when the game itself is working against you rant off return feb 12th 2016 after the big 2 1 patchkapkan is fixed no more sideways hidden laser trap yay we ve got dedicated servers now oh wait they re not dedicated servers it s a spectator that hosts the match in game which means it s still p2p and the computer is still busy rendering playing the game not dedicated like an hlds or other real console dedicated servers facepalm it is not an openly joinable server that stays online 24 7 either because it requires 10 players to launch and will close in 10 minutes if the 10th player doesn t join if the host backs out the server closes double triple facepalm oh blitz s head is actually behind his shield now i wonder if they moved his point of view from his chin upto his actual eyes as well slow clap here s the bug fixes posted on ubi s forum which is a strange place to begin with i ll add my commentary after each point in s gameplay fixesheadshot hits do not register properly fixed we will keep looking for additional improvement opportunities which means it is not fixed it s actually only improved not fixed exploit players able to clip inside walls using deployable shields fixed wait for it collar collision on frost and buck make headshots register as upper body damage fixed actually it s a piece of clothing with no skin behind it shouldn t cause a hit imo player able to clip inside walls by using deployable shields fixed didn t you already say that nitro cells stick to the edges of tiny leaves on plants fixed but they still stick like glue to the large leaves it should go through the plant and sit inside of it hidden wouldnt you want to hide a c4 inside of a bush i would blitz s gadget blinds players who were not facing it fixed but still doesn t blind players who are facing it consistantly so it s still a broken mechanic that causes his pistol to be unshootable for like 2 seconds yacht when playing during daytime with montagne broken glass decals are completely dark tentative fix we will be tracking for it once patch 2 1 goes live currently cannot reproduce the bug anymore internally please reach out to customer support if you experience it after the patch is live thank you which means they are not sure what caused it and are attempting a live test on the public aka not fixed there s a huge list of fixes but match making is still broken as ever a lot of exploits were addressed but consistancy issues still exist with hit reg and sync many operators still have broken or strange mechanic issues and the game still doesn t feel consistant this is a joke ubisoft update may 3rd 2016so here we are months later this game s match making is still horrible i had to boot the game 3 times to get it to the front menu we had people with connection errors being dropped from games we had to disband and reform our party many times due to errors and other nonsense game glitches and yes we all have open nat with the proper port forwarding the hit reg is a joke still i had put two double taps into a guys head and watch him turn around and try to shoot me the third double tap dropped him there was two blood explosions on all 3 shots and the target was twitch not a tanky high armor character his friend right next to him dropped with 1 double tap in the same fashion the net code sync errors still exist i had an enemy laying on his back facing me and when i went to shoot get this he started shifting left and right by about 2 body widths at a time glitching left and right i got the jump on him and he popped me in the head i played for about 3 hours tonight and this madness ensued all evening stay far away from this game unless you want to end up frustrated with the trash listed above this game has been out for nearly 6 months or 9 months if you include the beta test it s still broken as ever and runs horribly
