2018 if you see this for few bucks buy it just for single player it s amazing but why don t you recomend it then well i have never been so frustrated in a game in my life grind is here and it s more grindy then wow yeah never thought i d say this about gta but here we are missions are fun but don t pay much heists are nice if you got four friends to play them one of the first heists are for two people and you can get on that after you get almost a million bucks and then spend 40k more just to start it sure there more heists for two players if you got million more and they would actualy work fourth and fifth prep missions for first doomsday heist don t work at all cargo missions are bs to be honest you need a million more to start them yeah that s a lot of millions unless you got a helicopter which also costs a million bucks and you don t mind that after running some cargo for 15 minutes it gets blown up by a guy in oppresor that was waitng for you at the drop off and you can t do anything about it so far this is the most punishing game for a new player i ve played for a long time and i have played ds and other games that are hard but fair this one is not the case i ve never play much pvp there are more games that excel on this gameplay and gta is not one of them sessions are full with modders and it seems rockstar doesn t even care they care for you to buy those shark cards get your money and that s it at this moment the games is a pile of crap strawberry scented but still crap buy it only on sale and only for single player unless you re rich then go ahead and spend more on those cards that money will be lost both in real life and game
