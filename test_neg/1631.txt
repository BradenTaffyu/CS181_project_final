2022 in its current state i can t in good faith recommend the game before the game launched they patched in denuvo which has severely decreased the games performance for customers but it s not reflected in the reviews that came out before the game was launched making it as anti consumer as it gets but that s unfortunately not all the game has some core issues that make it less fun than previous entries primarily the campaign mechanics some of the chaos realms are amazing to look at but the surrounding gameplay isn t fun the race against the ai is frustrating and they clear the chaos realms with ease but for you it ll mostly be a boring slog of identical battles with infuriating corruption traits on your legendary lord and armies that constantly need replenishing the main battles in the chaos realms are nice to look at and provide some variation with attacking and defending points but the way to these battles makes you groan when it s time to do them again the biggest issue by far however is that they ve made a total war game that discourages territorial expansion the more you expand the more rifts to the chaos realm you ll have within your territory and the more rifts you have the more chaos corruption will spread with invading armies since you ll have your legendary lord and army locked away battling in the chaos realm you ll be left with whatever resources you have to combat these invasions you ll be lucky if you can field another good army to fight the invaders but with the replenishment nerf you ll be stuck trying to get your numbers up before you can engage again and while all this happens the ai will either decide to stand idly by or attack you ignoring most other of their enemies it s a shame because there are a lot of needed changes to the warhammer tw series like the changed sieges and minor settlement battles diplomacy overhaul and the new races are all interesting and unique i would honestly wait until the ca patches out denuvo and patches in the mortal empires campaign
