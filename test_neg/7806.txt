2022 playing this game is really fun and there is so much to do however the people ruin this game since this is a forced pvp game there are many people that have nothing better to do and just prey on noobs or people trying to do tall tales or even just trying to find treasure it is really frustrating when you are enjoying a story line and trying to figure out the riddles and a player comes to just sink your ship and all your progress is gone the creators refuse to create a pve server experience so this game will eventually die out imo due to toxic players due to my experiences i do not recommend this game if you are wanting to enjoy the game and not be subjected to toxic player base
