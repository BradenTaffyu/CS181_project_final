2018 i will never buy another rockstar game again i simply can t because they don t give me any other option last year i got banned from online play no i m not a cheater or hacker which is why i m writing this negative review what i assume happened is the following i hadn t played gta since launch but came across the lspd mod on youtube it s a mod that allows you to play as police singleplayer i installed gta and the mod and had a couple days of fun i m sure i accidentally pressed online play with the mod loaded once but killed the game right away then i uninstalled gta via steam and didn t play for months the christmas holidays came around i had some spare time and installed gta again i played online for an hour and got a 30day ban i initially had no idea why and no idea to find out as there s zero response from support about bannings other than an automated response saying all bans are final and to be honest i didn t care too much as i had only played for an hour and didn t feel invested i considered gta5 online to simply be broken i uninstalled gta again via steam and didn t think about it but a couple weeks later my brother said he had gotten gta5 during the steam christmas sales so we waited for my 30day ban to be over and had a week of fun playing the game but then exactly 7 days to the dot after the 30 day ban was over i got a permaban i assume i got flagged for another ban the second i logged in again and simply had some kind of 7 day cooldown timer or perhaps they have had a weekly un banwave i was lucky enough to play in between again i tried to contact support again no response but the automated one i tried asking for help on the forums but there i got called a lying cheater and actually harrassed by people so gave up on that quickly while googling for answers i came across the lspd mod again which reminded me i had tried it before i had a eureka moment searched my computer and came across some residual lspd files from months and a couple of full game reinstalls ago i tried to contact support again but still no human response i gave up forward to now after getting constantly reminded on youtube about gta5 videos of clearly modded online play i m still pissed i got banned for what i can only assume were some residual files from a mod that didn t affect my online game at all and let s not forget anyone who has ever played gta5 online knows it s fulllll of real hackers cheaters constantly messing up everyone s game by teleporting them around killing whole servers even dropping hacked money ontop of you so i figured i d see if rockstar support had gotten any better since last year to my surprise there s now a i don t want to get banned support request option i m pretty sure that wasn t there last year so i at least got my hopes up on finally figuring out why i got banned what s a better purpose for the i don t want to get banned support request than someone who doesn t know why he was banned and wants to prevent it from happening again but no just another automated message saying all bans are final and cannot be appealed even though i wasn t asking for an appeal my second support request stating my first request wasn t a ban appeal but an inquiry with information about my first ban because i don t want to get banned again got the same automated message saying all bans are final listen don t get me wrong if the anticheat system detected those residual files as malicious i totally deserved the first ban but i reinstalled the game several times technically i didn t do anything to the new installs it did that to itself by not cleaning the folders it uses and not protecting itself from outside influences on a fresh install i had no way of figuring out why i got banned the first time so no way to prevent it from happening again i m still only guessing it were those files the only victims of not letting people know why they are getting banned by an anticheat system are people who have no idea why the anticheat singled them out because they weren t actually cheating i mean mister l33th4xx0r can hack as much as he wants till his first ban and then has a good idea what to do to not let it happen again support is nonexistant not for i want you guys to have a look at my ban nor can you at least help me to not get banned again despite having a specific ticket request option for it again both youtube and the game itself are full of real actual hackers cheaters and people using non malicious mods online seemingly for long periods of time with no risk or even sense of wrongdoing of getting banned during online play i think it s simple gta5 has so many players but also so many real hackers cheaters that they ban such an enormous amount of people every week with thousands of them making false ban appeals that they can t search and perhaps don t care to look for those few who deserve a second opinion because the banning is perhaps the result of an over zealous anticheat program on their side so i simply cannot buy another rockstar game again nor recommend it to anyone else if i can t get support to at least figure out why i got banned it may happen again in the future and it may happen to you
