2023 this is some major horse manure releasing a new counterstrike game but instead of a separate new entry in the steam store they decided to replace counterstrike global offensive with it this merged the reviews community hub deleted peoples achievements in csgo etc i got csgo way back when it still cost money so valve has made a game i paid for free and then replaced it with a new installment of the series which can be argued is worse i paid for csgo and got it replaced with another game 0 10 valve took a big fat stinky dump right infront of the toilet bowl
