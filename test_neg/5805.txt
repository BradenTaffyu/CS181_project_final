2017 rainbow six siege is a brilliant first person shooter the maps are interesting the three game modes in mp offer enough variation and the roster of possible operators you can play as offers countless of different strategies the gunplay the different gadges and tools available to you it all works really well and it s a lot of fun even more so when playing with friends yet i can t recommend this game the game s netcode is well over a year after release still absolute trash and players with a high ping will get an advantage over other players in the match the matchmaking system too is horrendous it can take ages to find a match and in both casual and ranked you can often find yourself matched against players of a much higher skill level a team of 5 new players should not be matched against several gold and diamond ranks from the ranked gamemode nerfs and buffs to operators are often way too overdone the operator blackbeard found himself from being op upon being introduced to being rarely used after two nerfs and other operators that are in dire need of a buff or just a simple fix such as blitz a character carrying a shield meant to protect him from incoming fire who has a hitbox that allows the enemy to shoot him through his head an instant kill in this game while he should be completely covered by his shield ubisoft manages to reintroduce old bugs they patched out of the game somehow the fact that this has happened is ridiculous by itself but it happens every single patch the community was once great as can undoubtedly be seen from a lot of the reviews but over the past months it has grown a lot worse in a rare few occassions you find friendly helpful teammates and even enemies in your game but more often than not everybody trashtalks or blames others for their own mistakes with plenty of hackusations to boot the community has grown toxic and when you see yourself getting killed due to yet another game breaking bug only to then be trashtalked by friend and foe alike the experience just gets ruined i m going to still occasionally play this game with some friends and hope that things get better but in its current state i really can t recommend rainbow six siege to anyone unless they can look past all of these glaring issues before buying the game and potentially the season passes
