2018 i liked this game for a while when i first got into it it seemed like i could have a lot of fun doing the big missions and heists gradually getting cash for more and more exotic assets but unfortunatelty gradually can go a long way and this game proves that over my 400 hours i feel as if i ve accomplished nothing and that s the reason for some of the people who play this gaming having thousands upon thousands of hours on this game most of the missions have minimal rewards to them providing only a smlal amount of cash while 100 000 may seem like a lot of money given to you after doing an hour of cargo missions that s not even enough to buy most of the cars you d ever want to you have to spend more like 20 hours for that and that s made longer by the fact they put limits on how often you can do certain things and after you finally get that car you want it becomes boring pretty quickly after that and all of a sudden you re grinding for something else and with how broad the selection is and with them adding a new swath of cars every now and then it seems you can never truly be satisfied playing this game which is stupid because you re playing to feel satisfied but you can never be it s like cigarettes you can never have just a few you ve always gotta come back for more and more which is why i say this game is addicting but not candy crush addicting it s like heroin addicting sure they re both fun but at least candy crush isn t ruining your life and your family and you ll have to start telling your wife you spent that 50 on gas for the next few weeks when really it was for shark cards ultimately she ll become more and more suspcious but by the time she figures it out you re so far down the rabbit hole you re willing to put your kids up for adoption just so you can have more money to buy that new set of cars in this game this is of course made worse by the fact they have no anti cheat system it seems making just about every lobby a hacker lobby of which can get you banned relatively easily and takes away from the experience of the game considering most people who do hack are but some of the ones who do hack are doing it for money only because rockstar has their thumbs up their ass and expect all of their players to tryhard their lives away assuming they had one in the first place the elaborate review is to demonstrate how pissed off i am at this game i ve had great moments of fun and memories on this game but in the back of my mind i m always angry at rockstar for doing something bad to the game and i m not wrong for that i wish more people would protest them for all of this but nobody is for that this game will continue to be crap and when gta 6 rolls out that will also be crap since they ll be copying the gta 5 model ultimately i blame the community almost more than i do rockstar i can understand their capitalistic desires after all
