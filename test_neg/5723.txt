2018 used to love this game but since ubisoft had decided to censor the good stuff instead of fixing bugs and glitches i cannot recommend this anymore there were so many changes that i didn t like or agree but this time it is ridiculous update the censorship update was thankfully canceled so the passage above is just a reminder that this type of nonsense might happens if the player base don t experience their concerns btw i still cannot say recommend this game because of several patches they have made that neither improve the balance or make the game more enjoyable despite not being a true rainbow six game it was quite a unique experience however not every old fan would stick to it as the updates have changed the gameplay and feelings quite a lot
