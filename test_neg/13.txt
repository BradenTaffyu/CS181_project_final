as a warhammer fan the art the design just everything pleasing to the eyeas a game this game is overhyped and overpriced outdated gameplay that didn t innovate in any sense of the word i m disappointed that this was literally just sm1 with better graphics the content is extremely lacking 6 repetitive missions with repetitive gameplay to boot it s better to buy on sale for those who don t wanna read everything story it s brief generic and forgettable the plot is more generic slop comparable to a call of duty campaign so don t expect too much there the story is effectively glaze central for the blueberries then omg secret bad guy plot out of nowhere instead of tyranids being the main focus diverting from the more interesting developments that could ve been wish there was more focus with the marines themselves instead of lol chaos again lack of various qol options like fov sliders not enough graphics options to disable features like post processing effects or light sensitive features lack of support of various monitors motion blur literally doesn t go off when you set it to off the list goes on the game can be a disco show at times giving me headache on top of only being able to see my character s giant ass cheeks lawd haf murthy clunky movement and unresponsive actions at timesdodge is horribly delayed not many ways to cancel out of animations there s these weird moments where you stand still thinking you d dodge and you may say to yourself what i dodged what the heck well i m here to tell you you re not crazy the dodge is hard coded to buffer sprint as an action on pc resulting into delay actions because of the buffer option select between dodge and sprinting extremely ass cheeks clunky melee and ranged combat aimming feels stiff due to the options for sens being so limited but for the most part the clunkiness comes from how underpowered the weapons are there s about 4 usable guns i can think of in my head the sound design is lacking for some weapons and don t pack the resounding wallop that bolter has in other games then the crosshair bloom just makes weapons feels so off and boorish that s not even worth shooting half the time cause you can t hit the board side of a barn melee which i was hoping to be different enough to entice ultimately falls short dude to the lack animation cancels for dodge and more you end up parrying everything as much as possible for it is the only way to cancel downside being you re standing still to get peppered by bullets i hope it changes overly reliant on qtes or executions or deadshotsnow that know this may not seem like an issue at first but when you realize these are the only ways to regen armor during combat it becomes glaring it s cool to see the first 20 times but after 3 hours you ll wish there were introduce more ways to engage with regen standing still doing a cool animation with a camera interrupts the flow of gameplay and adds to the clunkiness of the game the lack of ways to regain armor is astounding they really want you to abuse executions and deadshots as much as possible cause of the iframes executions give you i wish the game would encourage aggressively slashing my enemies instead of having to watch an animation play for 500th time overly reliant on off screen indicatorsthis is the same problem i had with god of war 2018 where the fov was so low that had to see my characters huge ass back constantly taking backshots from tyranids because i have to look at the funny circle around my character and press the button it s lazy to me and makes combat feel unfocused difficulties are badly designedone sentence increasing health and damage and nothing is bad difficult design bullet sponges put people to sleep stop this really throws the balance out of whack content is lacking and the game is highly repetitivei can t be bothered to play the same 6 missions over and over again that hardly vary enough to be noticable there s not much to say because of the game not having content on release the only way they tend to vary is place x amount of bombs objectives change the number of bomb again how is this game 60 bucks i really wanted to like this game but it s just an outdated action game to me i m sleepy as when i made this review so i may have missed some points i wanted to make but don t buy right now wait for sale
