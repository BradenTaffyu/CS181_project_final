almost 400 hours i have been here since just after inception almost 400 hours on the game uninstalled it yesterday the wipe and the forced server move and loss of progress loss of many hours of mats collection and base wipe killed it for me i don t want to play tarkov or rust this could have been a great game that people could have specialties and go to the market and sell to people join strangers in open world and battle with them and be part of helping the working community the novice servers when it first came out felt like that so many people giving each other items they needed kindness in the chat people willing to come help you do the bosses and random people joining you in the open world and hanging out to do things with you for the day they say this is a mmo game it s not they made it seem like essential items from the first season would be able to be transferred to the next season that is not what happens you are extremely limited to what you can bring over with you and you are basically starting from scratch without the leveled up armor and leveled up weapons you worked hard to get before the wipe they made it seem like you could bring everything over for the next season and get bigger and better from there not so you start like a noob again have to level your character up again don t have access to your blueprints until you have leveled up again and all the additional special items and hoard of mats you farmed the first time don t move over with you it s insane who wants to bother with starting over again and again without being able to bring your progression and skills with you you are not going into a new season server with your weeks of hard work you are being thrown into it like a noob i ve put thousands of real hours into many different mmos picked my specialty built my homes castles farms etc and carried on in the same fashion without being forced to lose everything this game is a cash grab for loot crates and cosmetics the way it stands now the wipes ruin your long term progression the base you spent hours grinding mats for and making gone in 6 weeks the mats you grinded for hours and carefully inventoried in crates gone in 6 weeks the farm you made the meat you dried the specialty items gone the deviants you upgraded so you could have 20 to help run your base gone the give you a tiny amount of items that can be transferred and even then you can t use them until you have leveled up from scratch again this is not an mmo there is no purpose to try to do anything like you would on an mmo level to have it all removed from you in 6 weeks the balance on the servers is borked the fps is borked the community became uncomfortable and hostile and rude when the changes were made for hard servers and everyone was struggling with no mats or items from your hours of gameplay after 6 weeks the world chat is now full of trolling and abusive players a massive amount of people left including my mates so you now get stuck without anyone you knew from before to play with servers became full without many people returning to the server so you couldn t even invite a friend to it it s just a full server with no one on it now and no way to invite a friend to it customer service is ai not a human i don t want to play a mmo that is a rust or tarkov server that is ridiculous i have no idea why they are saying this is an mmo it s at best a slow rpg with massive amounts of anime mmo items teddy bear costumes cat tables etc that are pushed on you all the time why would i bother to spend massive amounts of hours trying to get mats to rebuild a home and can t even use my furniture i got because its locked behind my progression again and i don t have the mats to rebuild a home that cannot be rebuilt with your blueprint because you haven t unlocked that ability that you already had unlocked before the wipe absolutely insane why would i build an awesome base to have it gone in 6 weeks why catch and keep animals only to have it gone in 6 weeks the whole premise of this game is discombobulated and all over the place what could have actually been a really pretty mmo with the ability to create your own kind of place in the community has become a loot box mess of a wanna be rust server with the premise of mmo community that doesn t exist and mmo loot box cosmetics spammed at you all the time almost 400 hours yes i played everything twice then i left i won t go back in the state it is in the loot boxes the lack of listening to what the actual game playing community wants and not just what streamers want is bizarre there is no understanding by the devs that most people do not have 40 hours a week to devote to the game and don t want to come back to something they used their available time for to now suddenly be wiped it is an epic disappointment in multiple ways if you like wasting your time on restarting the game from scratch with no carry over progression over and over again then enjoy this free game otherwise if they don t make a lot of massive changes to the structure of the game it will be played one time through and dumped i am not the only one who has expressed these views there are thousands of us that played and left i just wanted to say that after almost 400 hours of this game i m out and the people who have also expressed these exact same concerns are also out this could have been a really nice mmo to explore and grow into it s not
