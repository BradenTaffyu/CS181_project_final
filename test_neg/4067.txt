2015 gta v has been reviewed and played by many and for the vast majority of gamers it has worked smoothly and given them a great single and multiplayer experience however not all is well and good i have found my game absoloutly riddled with bugs framerate issus login errors the game not even being recognizeed as downloaded not too recently i own a fairly high end gpu and a moderatly strong cpu and i still experience drops from 50 60 fps all the way down to 1 5 on a constant basis e mailing rockstar support with this issue only ended up with them apologising for my problems not offering any support or fixes at the time of writing i m really unhappy with the game i ve spent hours searching through youtube videos online forums asking friends advice but not no avail my current issue is that rockstar s social club failed to update even after me re installing the program i know i m just a tiny minority of the huge amount of people playing the game with significant problems like mine but somethiing really needs to be done you probably won t experience the same issues i know many people in my friends list don t but for me the game is pretty much unplayable
