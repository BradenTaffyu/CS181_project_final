i feel like this game is a rushed copy of the first meant to use people s nostalgia for a quick money grab plus i don t believe it had the amount of development that it is being said just my opinion based on playing the game only we get copy paste of monsters from the first game and barely anything new griphins harpies goblins chimeras drakes metal golems the thing that carries this game is players nostalgia i love this series but i guess i am upset at this i feel like this game was rushed out for the money medusa being the new monster its fight mechanics is basically the same as for the hydra the body model is also incredibly similar but i guess a snake is a snake also i prepared most of the game expecting to meet the medusa stacking up in items for petrification afraid of losing my pawns or getting outright killed then during the fight it wasn t even an issue she just moved around looking dangerously and died that s it and most areas feel rushed and unfinished the elf city had 2 main quests which is basically one quest divided and nought else i refuse to count the fetch quest with the tree sapling as content since teleport here and then back again should not even be a quest in an rpg the main arch in vermund gets forgotten the queen regent enslaves us trying to retain sven in power for no reason whatsoever but greed and nepotism and not only does it get forgotten at the endgame we take orders from them while having no option to go against it or have another ending to vermund s possible ruler the same rings true for bakbattahl massive city with a handful of quests that are neither engaging nor barely scratch the surface of the story the queen s assassination plot barely gets explored your mission is to go to a house and quest completed they promised a game that explores a race being oppressed and what not the only mention of this is people saying that your pawns stink a couple of times this having no impact in the game whatsoever plus again at the endgame the whole city dies because menella bugs out 50 of the times and doesn t get a quest marker so you can t find her the true ending the core story none of it made any thread of sense they showed the giant dude during trailers as an incredible part of the story it showed up when i was out exploring i had idea of what was going on before i even managed to get there the guy goes for a swim i thought i lost some massive part of the game a little bit of google tells me that it is barely relevant and a few dozen caves and such dungeons that have the same monsters you find literally everywhere else plus copper take it or leave it no content there plus escort quests because calling them fetch quests wouldn t be elegant so instead of fetching you are delivering i am really mad because some characters had some real charisma ulrika elf princess girl captain of the guards dude but had nothing to go along with them in ddda selene had one of the most interesting quest lines and associated story that i ve met in gaming i feel like they just grabbed ddda upgraded the graphics downgraded the story and content then placed it out if ddda didn t exist this would be an awesome game as it is it feels like an unfinished cash grab
