2016 hi this is about my first serious review and i ll try to advise you if it s worth it or not to buy the game based on my personal opinion as you probably know gta has two kind of game modes online and story mode and i ll judge both please remember this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what i feel about the game and i ll undersand and respect yours aswell story mode catchy story mode somewhat fun and dynamic questline some nostalgic feels balanced prices and easy fun huge map but feels somewhat empty my opinion it s pretty standard same grab this kill that race this kind of missions but is it good from my point of view it can be fun though it lacks the gta san andreas vibes but hey it s a new game if you came for the ol gangbanging drive by feel it will let you down mostly it s big game moves stealing banks and others but apart from that and that you can t get all the online perks and dlc stuff it s a pretty fun single player online huge open world tho some of it lacks content huge grind to get money almost everything overpriced community imagine cod s and minecraft community togheter yeah free dlc s but really expensive in game content hackers and modded accounts bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections weak ui somewhat challenging to get around game modes feel straight up pushed into the game just to add content races are fun kinda i understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered but without cash you can t get around really you need money for bullets money for cars money for houses money for almost everything it s the lifeblood of the game so in my opinion the online feels like a massive grind you ll get around but it just feels like you ll never enjoy the game to it s fullest without money the community is just random either they wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about it really feels like a pay to win game did i mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor new dlc out great what new content will i try oh i can t really afford any alright i got really side tracked there sorry i used to love gta but it feels that they ve went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get one car it s just not the kind of game i wouldn t buy and yes i regret buying it thank you for stopping by i hope this helped you in anyway take your time to read other reviews and don t stick with just one remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine good luck and cheers
