2022 i wish there was a game like it that wasn t it everything about this game is phenomenal except for the fact that it is deliberately designed to frustrate and punish you this applies to everything from combat to story telling and progressing quests i probably spent just as much time doing research on how to play the game than i did playing the game and i still managed to screw it up because i didn t know enough to me this game is like being in a toxic relationship i love the content but i hate playing it
