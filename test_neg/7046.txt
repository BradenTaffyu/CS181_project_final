2017 why is this game still 60 the servers are trash cant find anyone on anything unless you like regular team deathmatch and regular domination nobody plays hardcore and zombies nobody is ever on that either make the game 20 so that people will actually buy this game its been 2 years sense this game came out its time to drop the price if youre wanting to still make money off this game the only way id play this game is by having a friend share it with me id never spend 60 on it myself
