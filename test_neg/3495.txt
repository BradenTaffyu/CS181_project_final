2016 worst client support i ve seen in the last 10 years got banned just upon entering the game no mods or extra programs installed after the first ban expired got another one upon the second login all customer support can do send you scripted answers that they are not supposed to answer ban tickets all my other tickets with different topics are being simply ignored just great keep it going guys i ll think twice before buying anything from ckstar again not with this customer policy i do not advocate cheating or hacking but getting bans without visible reason and then being ignored by tech support screw that i ll better delete the game instead of wasting time on it knowing you can get banned any minute and have no clue why
