2021 product received for free sadly i would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking to do pve content if you re a pvp person you will have much fun for the pve people like myself there are good encounters and story content in the game but with pvp always on you do not get the chance to enjoy it you are always paranoid of other ships and 9 10 times they ate going to attack and sink you and all the progress and treasure is lost also if you re looking to play this solo as a pve person you will have a worst time due to the always on pvp all the people in my group got sick of the pvp always on when we wanted to enjoy it for the pve i hope rare decides to put pve realms in one day
