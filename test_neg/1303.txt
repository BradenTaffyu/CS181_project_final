2022 i feel both sad and glad to have seen a company rise to glory and fall to stagnation and complacency while the open world is incredibly impressive the game becomes a self parody through badly designed bosses copy paste bosses enemy spam horse combat unbalanced abilities a ost that is basic ds boss music without any inovation or personality and a world that can not account for player levels you are either blowing up everything or barely scratch enemies it is incredibly depressing that this is what from soft will stick with since they are being blasted with positive reviews it started off like exactly what i expected and hoped for but fell apart the further i got if this is your first from soft game just spare yourself the trouble and play ds1 instead
