2022 here s an interesting ordeal about elden ring the souls formula it s very much there entertaining gameplay very much there cool bosses very much there unfortunately for a title that really does have all the potential to be the game of the half decade it falls short in the qa testing and qol department how let me give you a list of reasons for some reason fromsoft decided that certain things such as having a check that ll have the game basically insult you for not closing it correctly was more important than fixing crashes guess what causes that check that makes the game insult you for not closing it correctly crashes guess what elden ring likes to do crash crashing can also corrupt your savefile and if you re not lucky enough that steam made a cloud backup you re permanently screwed over and have to restart from scratch say goodbye to your 100 hour character did you know that players can place a message at the bottom of a ladder and grief you by making it next to impossible to climb they can do that same thing for the top of the ladder i certainly hope you didn t fall down a pit in a certain mine and were scrambling to try and find a way up while a giant iron maiden with saws for hands was trying to murder you because you ll get to it be unable to climb it and pressing the interact button will just bring up a message from some moron that reads try fingers but hole as the giant 10 fullmetal killing machine grabs you from behind and kills you instantly why did they not pick up on this in qa testing again oh by the way you ll find this at nearly every ladder where something will be trying to kill you while you re climbing it because people are morons fall damage is terminally inconsistent there are sections where you can fall ten stories and survive without a scratch like in some towers there are others where you ll jump off a five foot high drop freeze then die upon hitting the ground stutters i run this on a computer that could theoretically be taken from nasa s server farm and i still get random times where it ll freeze for five seconds or drop to 1 5 frames for several seconds guess when this likes to happen during boss fights and times where things are trying to murder me were you a victim of dark bead mage twinking in ds3 guess what they didn t solve twinking you better be ready to get invaded by glass cannons that ve dedicated their entire build to int for using moonveil or str and arc in order to wield the pair of swords that create an instakilling gravity nuke that has an aoe the size of a debate hall are you not ready for them guess you re never playing multiplayer then because they re the most common invader types you ll run into and they re literally everywhere looking for build variety in pvp sorry everyone s either using bleed proc weapons or the gravity nuke swords you will occasionally find a person with a normal build otherwise it s going to be pain and suffering all the way down they re using bleed proc because bleed proc is one of the few ways to compensate for boss absurdity by the way if you re co oping with buddies whatsoever you re agreeing to being invaded and as you may see from the they didn t fix twinking up above take my advice you should get to the next boss fight fast because every second you linger is a second closer to another glass cannon invading and oneshotting you and your friends the grind to level up is horrendous after you clear level 30 hope you re alright with having to farm in excess of 10 000 runes for a single level and losing all of them to an invader or an enemy or boss you weren t ready for by the way there s a guy in a certain castle that ll just straight up steal a massive chunk of your runes every time you die and you have to kill him to make it stop does the game tell you this no so even if you get them back you re losing progress also he s apparently bugged to the point where his rune stealing will happen anywhere you die on the map have fun with that also on the topic of the grind looking to play legitimately sucks to be you pal you re going to be getting invaded by glass cannons twinks and people who are nonstop running rune farms left right and center which means you ll have to run rune farms to stay competitive which means you ll be spending more time farming than actually playing the game expecting bosses that have attack patterns that make sense sorry one of the first ones you fight is literally a twelve foot tall guy with superheavy attacks that moves like a ballerina and won t stop faking out or hesitating on his attacks which makes learning his patterns infuriatingly difficult this will happen a lot there are multiple spots in the world where you ll just be minding your business and fromsoft will happily drop an enemy far beyond your level and equipment rating atop you as a boss get ready for a lot of it s about skill not gear while you re fighting enemies with an instantly casting hitscan spell that drives your character to madness and kills them instantly also get ready for deathblight a thing that exists solely to kill you instantly and all the people running deathblight invasion builds for this exact reason really people are incredibly fond of saying skill issue when fromsoft casually drops what is effectively an ancient deity of chaos and madness on you in the overworld when you re sixty levels below where you should be to fight it by the way on the topic of that skill issue a heavily upgraded regular sword can take upwards of 50 successful hits to kill the first major boss while a slightly upgraded katana can do it in around ten swings and two bleed procs still about skill it never was equip bleed and watch a quarter of the health of a boss or 3 4ths the health of a pvp invader vanish once that procs it s a great game with plenty of merit clearly it has something to it because i ve played 43 hours at the moment of writing this review and i m still coming back but the problem is that there is so much rough around the edges missed bugfixing worn spots that need polish and rust that needs to be buffered out which fromsoft have either accidentally or willfully overlooked maybe you ll take it like everybody else and say it s your game of the year i have to disagree i m having fun playing it but that fun is directly tied to whether or not me and my friends can go 30 seconds without being invaded by another moonveil twink who has found the most optimal route to instantly kill three people with one use of its special attack the second they exit bonfire range
