2022 meh the game is pretty cool and has and very fun concept but the other players make it too toxic to enjoy you ll be out with your friends having a great time doing a raid spending hours of your lives getting loot just for some to come and blow up your ship after finally finishing the 3 hour raid and steal all your really makes you not want to play the game anymore same thing when you re trying to sell you ll show up at a port and start unloading your loot and a galleon will come around the corning and blow your little sloop to smithereens which you re not technically supposed to do since is says in the pirate code or whatever that all matters are to be settled at sea and not on land or ports or whatever not like that actually stops anyone from doing it so honestly until they figure out a way to make the player interactions less toxic i wouldn t really recommend it unless of course you are a league player and enjoy toxic communities then eat your heart out
