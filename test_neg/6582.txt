not completely garbage but it s not very good the first descendant consists of all the bad aspects of warframe and destiny 2 while offering absolutely nothing original in return it can be fun for few hours but sooner than you d think you will discover how bad the pay to win time gating and grind truly are in this game i can tell you from my personal experience that if you value your sanity and time you should stay far away from this game current state of the game is not great to say the least the optimization is not the best the micro transactions are very predatory and the game itself is plagued with non stop servers errors crashes lags desync rubber banding you name it at this time there s no review bombing the game is simply not great and not really worth playing the universe characters and story are bland and shallow honestly it feels soulless and unimaginative if someone told me this was some kind of ai generated slop i would believe them gameplay wise there s nothing really good here the combat is decent but don t really feel exciting or engaging movements are kinda clunky with that generic unreal engine feel to it at least the grappling hook is fun to use the first descendant is clearly lacking diversity in content to engage with the campaign missions are very repetitive and almost all the maps are lifeless and poorly designed characters skills are not very interesting and almost none of them feels satisfying to use the ai for enemies is non existent they are brain dead and only rush forward to the player it s a constant dps check without any tactics or skills required except maybe for the bosses in void intercept battles these special missions feature multi stages bosses they are still big bullet sponges but at least there s some mechanics attached to them unfortunately during void intercept missions the bosses health is scaled ridiculously higher the more players there are in the match so you can forget trying to do high level bosses with low level randoms if they don t have solid builds or you will fail all the times if someone doesn t do enough dps it s actually better to do them solo if you don t have a full pre made by the way i hope you have friends to play this game with you because once you complete the main campaign you unlock hard difficulty content but there s no matchmaking for high difficulty special missions maybe these developers thought their game was hard like destiny 2 raids and completing the hard difficulty was impossible with randoms spoiler alert it s not there s no communication required it s just a dps check fiesta without any mechanics from what i ve heard they might implement matchmaking in the upcoming months so this might be a non issue when the time comes in the first descendant the grind is absolutely disgusting you will have to repeat missions so many times to unlock new stuff to the point it ll make you sick because the drop rates are insultingly low the encrypted vault system in particular is the most outrageous when it s about wasting the players time they made the grind so obnoxious for the two most important things you desperately need to upgrade your characters and weapons catalysts and activators but fear not you can always swipe your credit card and instantly unlock what you need instead of getting brain rot grinding the same mission over and over again the pay to win is very strong here you can buy pretty much everything with real life money to get huge advantages in your progression we can say without a doubt that the cash shop is egregious nexon has once again and to no one surprise implemented an extremely predatory monetization structure i am not sure what they were thinking with these prices and insane grind they really are asking you to fork 100 for premium skins and characters for a detailed breakdown of the ridiculous grind required to unlock things for free go here major annoyance with this game is the inventory space in facts the inventory space is so incredibly small it might be a joke imagine playing destiny 2 but you only get fifty slots in your vault that s the kind of experience you will have with the first descendant the game will shower you with loot constantly during hard difficulty missions and it will turn the experience into a nightmare of tedious inventory management as a result and as expected you will be forced to buy slots with real money if you plan to engage with endgame content you do get slight increase in slots with mastery ranks but it s not enough all in all with the first descendant there s nothing you haven t already seen in other games it s just the new flavor of the month game and i think it will die pretty fast even faster knowing nexon is in charge here they copied so many things from warframe and destiny 2 but failed to improve or provide a similar enjoyable experience oh well at least there s the graphics and characters models they looks good but nothing truly amazing some female characters are overly sexualized and almost half naked so for that the game delivers if that s your thing i guess i am only playing this before it dies because i love looter shooters and because i m kinda burnt out on warframe and destiny 2 and i am so far into endgame in these two games that i pretty much have nothing left to do in them by all means if you never played these two aformentioned games then go play them instead of this mediocre korean grind fest hear me out even suicide squad kill the justice league is a way better and far more competent looter shooter than this soulless cash grab the current meta in the first descendant is a big joke the tamer machine gun dominate the competition by a long shot and all the exotic weapons don t really feel exotic at all finally it must be said that the terms of service and third party data collection are wildly abusive and very intrusive they are forcing data collection with no way to opt out of it overall the first descendant is far from being a great game and it was not worth the wait and not worth the hype if you think this game is better than warframe or destiny 2 then you have serious mental issues what a waste of potential ruined by the greediness and incompetence of nexon i do not hate the game it can be fun at times but the grind is just way too insane it doesn t respect my time the first descendant negatives far outweigh it s positives so i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone rating 5 10
