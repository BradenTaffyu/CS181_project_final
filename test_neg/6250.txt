2019 it s fun sometimes but typically very aggravating the dev team does an extremely bad job balancing the killers survivors which is going to be difficult in the first place but they don t listen to their community they end up buffing all the wrong things and nerfing the already nerfed you will be farmed by teammates you will be tunneled by killers and occassionally you will be camped and there s no real penalty to doing any of the listed toxicity in certain situations it s understandable to do one of the stated actions but it shouldn t be shined on the game itself still feels like it s in early access fps issues on specific maps loads of bugs that can make your game experience horrible matchmaking works most of the time but not all the time matchmaking however is probably the only feature in the game that s not that bad this game has yet to implement dedicated servers so if you re an uswest player prepare to play against people with 200 ping and get hit after vaulting when the killer was nowhere near you yay fun it s worth 5 99 but not 19 99
