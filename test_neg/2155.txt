having played the game practically since its release i think i have a good overview of its evolution so far and unfortunately since its launch too little has gone in the right direction improving on the gang beast concept it had everything to please graphically there are even a plethora of good arguments to recommend this game to you but at launch the game was sold as an 8 player brawler featuring some twenty different maps 9 last stand maps fighting in teams of 2 or 4 9 team score maps 4vs4 with objectives to reach 2 arcade maps can only be played by creating a private lobby or joining one in the first few months the chinese studio got the job done just over a month after the game s release on halloween the developers were already adding relative content but at the same time problems were already beginning to emerge as the chinese studio partnered with chinese streaming platforms bilibili and douyin to start with and granted them exclusive skins for halloween for example that could only be obtained by chinese users thus penalizing other players this led to a number of problems as these skins obtained by code could to cut a long story short be used twice as a result chinese players having used the code once for themselves would try to exchange it with players from europe north america south america for a code that the studio had set up with discord also usable twice and which penalized chinese players in this code exchange there were numerous scams on both sides and in the end it created a very bad climate between the gaming communities shortly afterwards the studio announced its roadmap explaining that there would be a major update every 3 months including a new map and new skins which augured well for the future the problem was that their first major update was delayed by a month to fill the gap they added a new map and introduced the friend pass allowing players to invite their friends to play the game with them for free a fine initiative to be sure unfortunately the worrying comments made by the studio were already summed up in this sentence we ve noticed that many players are looking for a place to chat with others rather than just fight patch note dated 16 12 2023 i don t know which players they re talking about but nobody expected the studio to focus their money and energy on creating a place within the game where players could chat instead of fighting not only because this place already exists the arcade maps but also because if players have paid for a fighting game it s because they want content related to what they ve paid for at the end of january these concerns prove to be well founded their first update for the brawler they d sold to players introduced a uno game renamed paws in one of the arcade maps as well as a jukebox that s it to counterbalance the anger of the players less than 10 days later they released a new map which didn t convince anyone because it was too similar in principle to another existing map the 2nd update doesn t do much better as it also arrives a month late and once again takes players by surprise it introduces a new game mode with 2 missions playable solo or in pairs against bots after 10 minutes of discovery to complete them and i m still being kind you start to wonder if you haven t been ripped off as the devs are moving further and further away from the fighting game they originally sold us well i m tempering that a little because there s one good thing in this update and that s the appearance of another game mode smash which fits into the combat category it s well thought out it s fun and it deserves to be said the 3rd update arrived on schedule are we going back to basics no of course not this time recreate set out to offer players a mario kart version of party animals it s certainly well done and there s much more fun to be had in the one and only race than in the 2 challenge missions of the previous update but when are you going to keep your promises where s the roadmap but all this is nothing compared to what s to come the ultimate betrayal that buries the game for good in the game there are several ways to knock out your opponents light punching is the use of small punches lp heavy punch run and punch hp dropkick jump and kick dk headbutt is a headbutt hb there are two other techniques which are not explained in the game s tutorial and which have been found by players through experimentation the superman punch is a combination of three keys and allows the player to levitate briefly after his punch the fling is an improvement on the superman punch combining 4 keys and allowing the player to project himself in the direction of his choice knocking out anyone in his path on the other hand the fling is not without risk as it can backfire if misdirected or controlled these techniques and the fling in particular have rapidly become extremely popular among players because although they are extremely satisfying to perform mastering them requires training and demonstrates a skill that any player wishing to improve must master can you see it coming at recreate they re doing everything they can to kill the fun since the release of their game they ve only done what they wanted to do and whether we like it or not that s the way it is our only treasure was the fling but they took it away from us faced with the tidal wave of anger they backed down but in the worst possible way the fling now consumes a phenomenal amount of stamina and can no longer be played worse still the fling s nerf has created a domino effect on all gameplay and the game s dynamics have been completely ruined hp has become punishing for the user as it consumes far more stamina and hits the opponent even less than before the lp which already consumed no stamina has become much better as it hits far more than the hp dk has become exceptionalbefore the nerf the game required skill it wasn t simply a matter of doing dk over and over again in your desire to make the game more user friendly for new players you ve not hesitated to scuttle the rules of the game what you re doing is not the right solution all you re doing is making the game less attractive you change the rules without prior communication without even telling the players what has changed you re gradually destroying the trust and esteem the players had in you at the time of writing there are barely 3 000 daily players on the game this pales in comparison with the 60 000 of the early days this lack of players has prompted recreate to find solutions already present from the start of the game bots have become the most important player community if you thought you were playing with a player called snoopdogg or papasmurf you re just playing with a bot their intelligence is disastrous and you ll soon realize it bots are of no use to the game worse still there s a good chance they ll get in your way or accidentally kill you it seems vital to go back to an earlier version of the gameplay mechanics and the very foundations of the game until this is done this game deserves this comment
