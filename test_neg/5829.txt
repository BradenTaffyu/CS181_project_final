2021 this game still has not added adequate balancing measures in terms of matchmaking what i mean by this is that it consistently matches you with people who can be way higher than your skill level in gamemodes like quickmatch and it s a pain in the ass to try and enjoy a slightly more peaceful game that doesn t involve the stress of the effort required to play ranked someone would then maybe ask why not play ranked then to have people of your skill level matched against you and that d be a good idea yet it becomes a problem when i am encountering people who are smurfing harder than raja gosnell and aren t even trying to hide it these sorts of imbalances make it a pain in the ass to enjoy the game most of the time and just a very unnecessary irritation for players new to the game you literally cannot learn to be better at the game if you are literally unable to because 8 10 of the time i get matched against people that are simply better than me and the game won t give me a chance to be better bare in mind ideas by ubisoft to fully do something effective about smurfing and balancing this game to a maximum extent have only just been brought up right as you read this review ideas and features to prevent this type of imbalance in the game should have been done at the start i get that the game has this get good motto when it comes to playing but there has to be a middle line when it comes to getting better at the game in it s current state
