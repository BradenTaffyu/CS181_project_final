2016 updated review of december 7th 2018 it s been a few years since i left starting from the r8 revolver what has been added micro transactions music kits stat trak swapping tools glove skins cod like operations now it s going f2p and having battle royale wasn t this game focusing on team based cooperation i guess not anymore cs go is now counter strike globally sold out great job valve the mts weren t enough so you added this game mode to appeal to the mainstream normies i sure can t wait for the fornite players to come here or maybe they won t updated review of may 2nd 2016 gambling in blackjack offers a better chance in winning the jackpot than the crate system this is what cs go has become most people not even gamers only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game it was the obnoxious arms deal update that struck down cs go into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it don t believe me since micro transactions were introduced floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks i had to reject and block them yes it stopped but the damage was done lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to steam support that they implemented those steam market policies that punished everyone who uses the market for the other side that do care about the game to some degree they re just as bad too just about any action you do just leads to an immediate reprimand from other players to the point why bother even playing online then comes to the badly handled competitive system when i did join i keep on having idiots on my team or a player who would not stop mic spamming and was kicked i had to put up with this for around one hour and nearly all the time the incompetence from my teammates cost me of a victory never again and now that co op mode has bordered cs go to a game like call of duty and battlefield the operation missions were one of the earliest examples of that they have failed to regain my interest and trust in the game also the community is toxic more toxic that an irradiated area of chernobyl the community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a vac ban trade scam or competitive ban around 90 the other 10 is usually a giveaway the community is also hostile to any sort of criticism calling out anyone who dares to criticize their holy game as silvers noobs etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right guess what i played the game long before the arms deal update and the community was not like this it was a decent game and it was much much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item as such you guys most likely make minh lee and jess cliffe embarassed by forgoing the true spirit of counter strike want to prove me wrong then don t leave those cliche d insults in the comments page cs go should be put out of its misery one day and i suppose until that day comes i play the older counter strike games that actually gives more respect to gamers and the modding community regarding weapon skins and models that had more work put into them can t comprehend with this review deal with it i have lost faith in the steam forums anyway due to the immature nature of people here
