2020 first things first i don t recommend you play the free version oh no paid version sure the game is great really competitive so i would suggest you play it with friends less rage more fun encountering hackers ruin the game i see a lot of positive reviews that read great game but get rid of the hackers that should not be a positive review how can such a big game with such big events have so many cheaters it s like valve doesn t care anymore or even ever cared if you want the game to be free just make it really hard for those who just started to play competitive ranked make someone play at least 20 hours or 15 or maybe even 10 but do something i love playing with my friends who don t own the game and can t actually buy it but one match with a hacker ruins our night and we just end it there and no no you should not have to buy a free game so you don t find hackers that is retarded valve i am just starting to think that you want hackers in the game so people are forced to buy it guess what all the advancements all the progress and all the accomplishments you will ever have mean a lot less to the people you are mistreating now just care a little bit until the day this game will change this review will be negative thanks for reading
