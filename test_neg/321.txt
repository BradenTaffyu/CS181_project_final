title a disheartened player s goodbye to counter strike 2as someone who s been playing counter strike since 1 6 i ve spent countless hours immersed in its gameplay but now it s time to say goodbye to counter strike 2 the reason cheaters and toxic players have taken over ruining the experience for everyone else i ve seen the game s integrity decline over time cheaters run rampant and toxic behavior especially from certain regions has become the norm matches are often ruined by hackers or players who kick others or grief just for fun despite my love for counter strike i can t ignore these issues it s disappointing to see the developers focus on superficial additions like new skins instead of tackling the game s core problems features like dynamic smoke feel like distractions from the real issues so i ve uninstalled counter strike 2 it s tough to let go of a game i used to enjoy so much but i can t keep subjecting myself to this toxic environment maybe if the developers start taking cheating and toxicity seriously i ll come back until then it s goodbye to a game that used to bring me joy
