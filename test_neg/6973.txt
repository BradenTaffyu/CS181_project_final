2021 do not buy this game expecting to play multiplayer back when it came out it was good and enjoyable my friend and i recently reinstalled to test out the zombies again neither of us own the zombie expansion and will not be buying it for the ridiculous price in 2021 but i m not done talking about the multiplayer the lobbies are all hacked you enter a game only to have someone invisible shooting you or an aimbot that is even if you enter a game the games we tried playing last evening it would start and then the match would end in a draw at the beginning i thought it was the servers until some a hole said get crashed erik and my whole game crashed nice job nerd i imagine holding lobbies hostage is hilarious for all of 5 minutes but beyond that really you re quite a loser lol treyarch activision are sh t companies who aren t going to fix problems like these and you can do better with your money that being said zombies with friends is fine but 60 hell no lol get out of here treyarch this game is 5 6 years old and you want full price hilarious do not buy this game
