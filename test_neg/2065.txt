2023 feel good bots when i played on release i was curious about why the devs had decided to use bots that s because they use them in pvp player vs player game modes where it s supposed to be full of people not only that but the only indication that they were bots was certain animation jank involving the grappling hook the answer despite what other reviews say it wasn t an issue of population they were prevalent even on release in all queues no it was an issue of psychology if you feel good playing the game you will be more likely to buy microtransactions minion masters also sneakily does the same thing no thanks i ll wait until they can physically make me feel good psa look up click farms and maybe you ll see why 2000 positive reviews consist of the words cool game
