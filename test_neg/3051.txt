2016 would i recommend grand theft auto v yes well made game would i recommend grand theft auto online no here s why i logged on earlier today only to find i have been permanently banned ironically i was looking at the recent reviews moments beforehand and wondering what they were talking about now i myself have fallen victim to a ridiculous fault in the game itself did i break the rules nowas i given a reason date any information nocould i appeal nowhen i tried to appeal not once but twice i received an automated response under new regulations that i could not appeal from a ban advice if you planning on buying this game for singeplayer go ahead if you were planning to delve into gta online don t if you do all i can advise is to play in friendly lobbies don t record your gameplay make sure your internet is 100 stable never play missions with random people or do anything publically as you can see this is very limiting but any one of these reasons could have gotten me banned rockstar has the worst anti cheat system i have ever seen and i did not expect to buy the game and be unable to play it after spending around 500 hours on it which makes it all the more bitter it is honestly such a shame that they had to ruin a fun game fortunately there are other games that will not disappoint you as much as this one
