2019 up front before the big rant the story mode is pretty nice but my main focus is gta v online which is a hot pile of garbage i never played a game with so many bugs problems and crashes in 2015 i started playing the game lets start with the obvious to find and join a session takes ages and can often result in errors or landing in singleplayer it has the longest loading screens ever only money related glitches getting fixed by rockstar modders are in 1 3 lobbys they are not only disturbing you by killing you or are doing other crazy but also by changing the weather in a way that your screen goes black flickers is just suddenly stutters frezzes and then crashes out of the blue sometimes wasd suddenly does not work anymore in chat are the keys still usable heists some take ages with setups and preparation not enough money for the time spend and compared to the prices of vehicles buildings if some part of mission fails it takes ages to restart you drive fly 5 years to get to your misson some heist dommsday are way to hard you lose the items you used in a failed try round 1 5x bombs restart round 2 4x bombs business not realy possible solo if played with friends no payout for the people who help playing with friends and not being the head of command brings no benefit or any real money stupid timer for crates or cars when you try to source or sell them need to wait until you can source a new crate if for some mystical reason the game crashes while delivering something it is obviously gone it makes no sense to restock the business in the slightes sense vehicles if you buy e g the rim x and want now the rim y and after that switch back to x you need to rebuy the same rim again pay2win no matter what it is too expensive to get somewhere you need to grind to your death sharkcards are a stupid idea and are also far to expensive compared what you can get for themin the time the game was out for pc i feel like there where next to non perfomance upgrades or real problem solving fixes for the huge obvious problems the only updates the game got where content updates which where atleast free however the ingame content is way too overpriced should you buy the game when is is on sale for the singleplayer yes for the multiplayer no
