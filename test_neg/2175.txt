i said i would give the rating a thumbs up if the fling was brought back and it was although after bringing this back it was heavily nerfed beyond comprehension at first i could understand the nerfs and how party animals wanted to make the fling a last resort option for an attack when in the right situation rather than it being an abused tool to gain large distances but they went about it wrong and did too much personally i think they should change the stamina drain from how it is currently over half to using 1 3 of your stamina instead i think using stamina for a fling is reasonable and understandable adjustment but it s currently too nerfed for this to be considered a good movement option using the fling also takes ages for your stamina to recover which i think personally should not exist make the stamina recovery time back to normal when doing a fling with how the fling is now there is no benefits to it whatsoever with this in mind also make the distance and height traveled during a fling back to how it originally was right now it s an awful tool that punishes you wayyy too heavily and following these adjustments would balance the fling to where it would be a good tool to use in a situation while also not being abused due to the understandable use of stamina taken that i recommended as well as the normal stamina recover time after doing a fling the fling originally wasn t some free win card except on conveyor with my adjustments in mind this would fix every issue the fling ever had there was it s perks and downsides to using it before the nerf the perks were the long distance you travel after doing so the downsides were traveling too far and either getting knocked out or dying this is what made the fling so much fun to use now there are no perks whatsoever and the downsides are little to no stamina for long periods of time using the new fling will knock someone out yes but your stamina would be too low to even go for the punish and finish the job fix the fling super kicking the ball is more of a problem than the fling ever was and that still exists also while you re at it fix the punching delay this is awful very awful all anyone is ever doing anymore because the heavy punch is so awful is dropkick spamming which i can understand because the heavy punch is now so unbelievably awful to use than before who asked for this fix this guys why is it that when you bring a bug to a perfectly fine aspect of the game you patch the bug not as good as it originally was and add even more bugs along with the patch an example of this was that you d drown on typhoon when you ran out of stamina in water slipping people on typhoon near the end when everything is under water would remove their stamina entirely which would have them instantly drown which was a perfectly fine aspect to the game and make bananas more useful then they are when the water stamina bug was introduced and wouldn t let you climb after running out of stamina while in water due to it not regenerating on maps that originally would allow stamina regeneration like ice breaker you messed up how stamina worked overall removing this element of instantly drowning when you ran out of stamina when slipped on a banana peel in the water the issue was fixed but as i explained brought another issue to the table please party animals stop with the horrible takes on the movement and the combat system and actually focus on the issues in the game when i feel these issues are being resolved then i ll change my rating of the game this used to be my favorite game topping everything else and i was going to make a video on this game about how amazing it is and how there is no issues i ve faced when it came to fixing bugs generosity of unlocking things without paying real currency etc until all of these issues were introduced it really was a low blow to my creative flow and my motivation to even create the video after everything that happened all in a short span of time please listen to the community i know you do because you brought back the fling but nothing will change if we don t speak up about these issues and i hope party animal devs you understand my concerns thank you
