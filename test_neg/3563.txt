2016 really wish there was a recommend but to keep it simple if you re buying it for single player go for it it s fun it s a good visually stunning well optimised gta game with a decent story and plenty to do i still find gta vc is better for setting soundtrack story and gta sa the most fun gameplay wise but that could just be nostalgia looks like the singleplayer expansion dlc is never coming large areas like the casino race track prison etc are all well modeled but they remain unused and inaccessable buying for multiplayer give it a miss as many have already said it s a total show online load times are absurdly long and frequent ui is crap theres no server browser and no modded server support the key element of the game it s the title for christ sake is stealing cars but guess what you cant keep them in online they must be purchased items worth having online require ridiculous amounts of grinding due to low rewards for missions and any new cars boats planes are added at extremely high prices to sell shark cards there isnt enough to do or enough fun to be had to justify the time required to buy said items without microtransactions the games anti cheat system is pretty much non existant cheaters hackers run rampant killing players and or spewing cash seems kind of baron of things to do online with friends once you ve completed the heists i really don t care about mp in a gta game a token mode allowing friends to jump in and do co op in single player would have been much better you already have 3 protagonists doing missions together i sincerely hope mp s influence is minimal on the development of future titles bully 2 gta vi rdr 3 but unfortunately that s highly unlikely
