2020 this game s zombies is great and on pc the mod community is great and make it worth playing but i cannot justify a current 60 price tag for it nor the even greater price tag if you want to play all the zombies maps the campaign is a show and not even worth a play and the multiplayer is dead and a bit fun with friends at best wait for a heavy sale to play zombies if not skip
