2018 do not buy this unless it is on sale it has been 5 years since this game came out and and it has been great for the first 3 years now the dlc has become so expensive that you have to grind to get anything here is some of the price gouging rockstar has done to make you need to buy sharkcards i have not but it s clear what message they are sending clotheseverything was under 5000 by a lot at the beginng of the game now everything you buy is minimum 5000 or above some outfits cost 60k to over 300k some that are literally just underwear tattoos follow the same trend they are all many tens of thousands of dollars carsthe most expensive car used to be 1 million and then went up to 1 5 million and now it sits at 2 8 million wtftoys things that make things explode fly or go fast they all cost over 2 5 million no matter what you need and some you need to spend more than 2 million to even buythe pay walls are horrible and it shows the general trend in video games lately that the developer treats you like a cash cow they try to milk your wallet like its an udder and at the same time don t even keep up the servers so that you don t get booted every 20 minutes your ability to earn money is paywalled to hell and even then you are not in much luck anymore even with heists i ve owned this game on xbox 360 and pc payed full price for both i have hundreds and hundreds of hours on this game and am incredibly saddened by how it s been shot to do better rockstar
