2020 tldr game good but buggy business practices bad play but no buy stuff until fixlong version at the time of writing i have 529h play time on origin in apex legends i ve been here since season 0 to put things into perspective a bit better to me this is the best battle royale out there that i ve tried and the only one that had me stick around it s action packed creative beautiful and fun highly recommended to play with friends at this point you must be thinking why is the review negative then you dope well i ll tell ya buckle up buckaroos because this is the long and negative side of the review i m so happy i can voice my concerns now that the game is not tied to ea s origin al sin anymore the publisher is ea if you didn t catch that so of course expect sleazy practices and boy you got em monetization just recently season 7 came out and damn did they nerf the battle pass this time around question are you a casual player who has a career and or family or dare i say it other things other than apex legends in your life get out of here this isn t for you we only take pro gamers who pump out double digit gaming hours daily or a lot of money and please don t give them more money to put it simply it s grindy extremely grindy and it s clear what they re trying to do to us don t stand for it and vote with your wallet this kind of stuff is what ruins communities as for the skins you buy with real money let s look at the halloween event we had just now a bundle with 2 old and 2 recolored skins from last year and 1 banner animation cost you want to guess yes 60 eur which means you can buy a completely new triple a game with the same amount of money it gets worse though if you want a heirloom legends carry it around while you play when you unlock them eg kunai knife for wraith naruto you need to buy all 24 event skins which equates to about 180 or eur otherwise you can only get a heirloom through rng with loot boxes apparently 500 loot boxes for a heirloom wow right 180 eur to get everything from a short event you could buy the witcher 3 cyberpunk 2077 skyrim fridge edition call of duty 69 420 and heaps of indie games you probably like for that money technical issues servers are 20hz tick rate you can feel it you can see it and you can even hear it speaking of hearing the sound is completely gone quite literally this season 7 has 50 of the sound in game during gunfights retired and on a vacation and i ve asked around just in case it s just on my end we get new bugs each season which take a lot of time to fix and that s fine i guess but some issues like the subpar servers and sound issues persist since the games release the game is not optimized well but it does look good and the graphics are beautifully stylised in my opinion on the new map olympus if you step into a particular waterfall your fps gets cut in half previous maps have suffered from fps inconsistency and drops but this is the worst example i can think of i m at 1440p with a rx5700 gpu and an 2700x cpu thermals are great don t worry and the fps manages to drop to 30fps sometimes and even below that i tested the drops with a couple of friends and strangers and it s repeatable on both amd and nvidia systems which is a great look for the testers and devs at respawn should you play it yeah it s free and also fun should you give them your hard earned money not until they improve
