2018 rainbow six siege i have to admit that it is a good game i love it very much but do you know the call of duty the holocaust of god the rockets alliance and the exile road when playing in steam high pings often occur but the joy of the game does not affect chinese players after being represented by tencent it did not promote and locked the country the reason is very simple a profit oriented company cares about the player s traffic to generate income as the previous stage of publicity is not enough the domestic environment is tepid tencent simply hides the game so much that it is now many people do not know these games tencent is a good company but it s not a good game company i like ubisoft very much so i don t want this move to lead to your future status in china where did you really make china s domestic independent game yes steam china has its own wegame but it can t be on the shelves because in tencent s eyes they can t bring benefits therefore i sincerely hope that ubisoft as well as some foreign game companies will not give tencent a good game actually there are many good agents in china such as perfect world etc i am a gamer and even a gamer i believe that every game lover hopes that the games he likes will last long not the end thank you i m an ordinary player from china chestnut
