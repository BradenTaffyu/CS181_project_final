2018 this is the support ticket i sent to rockstar epicfourthwalljul 2 16 12 edti launched the game played the tutorial and then played with a friend and then quit got back on joined my friends clan while trying to kill my him and then i fell off some rocks to be killed by a car not even given a chance to respawn i was told that i was banned until august 1st total play time 2 hoursi feel as though i have been cheated because i don t believe that playing your game is deserving of a suspension if there were modders in my game i don t think banning randoms helps i bought this game to play with my friends and although playing offline is an option this ban has ruined my view of the game and i will not be playing nor recommending it
