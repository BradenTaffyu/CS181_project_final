2020 while i ve put quite a few hours in to this game and will still probably continue playing i can t say i recommend it to someone looking in to an asymmetric multiplayer game on the bright side of things provided you have a full host of friends to play with the game is a blast having friends that are patient and more concerned with having fun than winning make this a rather pleasant game to play the developers are constantly releasing new content to include new killers and survivors on the down side the game is buggy very buggy much more then you would expect from such a small game with little variation in interactions getting stuck on terrain getting locked in animations being struck through walls or seemingly from random all of this is relatively normal and sadly kind of accepted the game has a competitive mechanic if you re into that sort of thing but seemingly doesn t utilize it s matchmaking data to keep the game engaging or competitive when i first started playing i played against very high ranking and ruthless killers that were much more skilled than i was now that i have ranked up it s rather common i play against brand new killers or low ranked killers who by the end of the match you can t help but feel bad for a lot of the community wanted dedicated servers because host advantage was significant and often provided extremely unfair match ups dedicated servers solved this but brought on a whole new slew of issues from lousy hit detection to varying degrees of teleporting from killers and survivors both at some points killers can hit you from what seems like up to 15 feet away at other times they would miss point blank strikes the community while mostly pleasant and easy to deal with suffers from an issue i ve affectionately called who can cry the loudest a lot of the feedback the developers consider basically boil down to who they see the most complaints from because the community is completely divided about gameplay balancing survivors want games they don t have to put effort into and killers want to be able to kill all four people every time while i understand asymmetric multiplayer games are notorious for being difficult to balance it just starts to feel like the developers cater to full circle who cries the loudest the game is riddled with painstakingly artificial difficulty the only skill that will ever be put to the test is a survivors ability to run around a piece of terrain until the killer loses interest or a killers ability to guess a survivors route location both groups have perks that feel like they were implemented to annoy or irritate the other with some exceptions queue times for finding a game are often ridiculous and it s not abnormal to spend more time finding a match than being in one if you happen to queue with a high ranking person don t be surprised to be ridiculed for your lack of experience survivors have tedious and exhaustive tasks and killers have the sometimes impossible task of outwitting a four person team with voice comms the leveling system the bloodweb seems reasonable at first glance then you start to realize that in order to get perks or abilities that make you last longer or give you more of fighting chance you have to level up characters you may have no intention of playing you re expected to play the character that you want to play in order to save up bloodpoints the in game currency to level up characters just to have a chance that you ll find the perk s that you want on the available item choices once you cross that threshold you then need to level up the character you wanted to play in order to receive the aforementioned perk on their bloodweb maybe i m just hypercritical because i m not a competitive game enthusiast but many friends and past teammates share my views on some of the points listed above some having more than triple my game time
