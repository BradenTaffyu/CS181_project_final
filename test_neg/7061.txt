2019 where to start with this game the only thing keeping it alive is the zombies mode since you can use the workshop and get new maps etc the multiplayer is dead the story mode is ok but bo2 was better and the fact that the price of this game is 80 with chronicles is kind of ridiculous so would i recommend this game no why because there much better games you can buy with 80 in 2019 that are so mcuh better but if you like zombies and are willing to only play that then go for it
