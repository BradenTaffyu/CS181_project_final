2019 i have bought this game three times each time i have returned it and given up trying to activate it because social club ie rockstar won t let me activate it due to this steam account being linked to some forgotten social club account from years ago multi week processes and then i give up exchanging emails with these idiots they then close the ticket developer support is the most horrid i have ever seen edit after this comment my social club access was fixed the game is good but my thoughts on their awful customer support remains the same
