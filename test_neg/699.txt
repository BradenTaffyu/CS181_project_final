2020 while i do enjoy this game from time to time i have no right to say i would recommend this game to anyone through all the hours hundreds of dollars spent on skins i think this game has genuinely changed how i look at life in a negative way the toxic community is nothing short of awful they will send you death threats because you kill them in a competitive match and i am no exception i have said things that are so inhuman however i find my self not feeling remorse for saying such awful things i think i can blame that on the fact that its normal in every game you will play this is an awful place to go if you re ever feeling the slightest bit down please if you re considering installing this game don t it will save you from so much not needed toxicity i love you csgo but you ll never be a good game with the community you have
