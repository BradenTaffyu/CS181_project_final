2016 first of all 150 hours 30 in the last two weeks but still a negative recommendation what gives it s simple this game is plagued by numerous game breaking technical flaws sloppy netcode serves are few and far apart client side calculationsif a competetive shooter had even one of these issues it would be a cause for concern r6 has all three these issues are so prevelant and impactful that you re forced to have them in the back of your mind while you re playing which constalty rips you out of your gaming experience i might have let some of this slide but these issues have gone unadressed since the games release to start off the majortiy of players have bad pings and i mean bad above 100ms on average and there s no server browser so you really have no control over it this could easily be fixed by just adding more servers but that would be too costly for ubi oft the tickrate of the game is 60hz which is alright but shootings ending in simultaneous deaths happens quite a lot my biggest issue with the game however is that the client is in charge of things that should be handled by the server bodies falling over smoke grenades and debris is all handled client side this sounds bad but it gets worse bodies and debris can fall in unpredictable ways and can look totally different from player to player a barricaded window can look as though it s whole on your screen but on someone elses screen it actually has a hole in it this for example inexcuseable gfycat com but it doesn t end there bodies and debris have hitboxes that can block your bullets but not theirs the technical issues continue the animations in the game are good when they work when they don t however it results in and wall punching induced rage getting shot through your shield happens so often it s become a meme in the community all of this combined makes the game only enjoyable when you re not playing competitively and it s a damn shame too because this is a great game but it s crippled and in dire need of help if ubisoft ever fixes these issues i will change my rating but i wouldn t hold my breath edit apparently the ping you see ingame is suppose to be divided by two so the average player ping some something like 50 which is alright but it sure doesn t feel like it is
