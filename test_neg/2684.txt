2018 i highly do not recommend gta v or gta online i like many others have had my account mistakingly suspended and reset recently due to a new anticheat script used by rockstar this is leading to the banning of innocent players with no reversal appeal follow up investigation or notice to the player of the offense i ve been playing grand theft auto online legit since gta iv in 2008 i have over 600 hrs of gametime if you include my time on xbox one i loved the whole series since top down but in 3d gta the pay2play is top of the line shark cards really leave you feeling like you were just taken by a shark i ve spent more money on this game than i d care to admit but i never cared to cheat hack mod whatever i played the game legit with my friends and just dabbled time to time after no one played anymore now i can t trust rockstar at all because i don t harrass other players or even play with old friends just by myself every once in a while but now i m banned for some mysterious offense without justification or human attention to the situation when requesting an explanation i like everyone else with this problem have been met with an automated reply hello sensisoulja thank you for contacting rockstar support gta online bans are triggered by a number of factors including modding in gta online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience all gta online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed for more information on the gta online suspension and ban policy please see regards rockstar support i was playing a game in gta online setting up my hanger because i haven t played for awhile and needed it for my akula i bought after selling a bunch of old cars my brother gets in the house from work so i went to talk to him for maybe 8 minutes came back to the game expecting to be kicked for being afk but this time it says i have been suspended til july 1 2018 if and when i come back my account will be reset i don t know what happened but i don t mod hack or do any other nefarious activities online at all after doing some research i find out apparently there is a newly implemented anticheat program that they claim is very accurate at detecting hackers modders manipulators and harrassers plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped or banned by mistake with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups not only will not be buying another game from rockstar again but i highly do not recommend gta v because the chances of being banned and wiped fraudulently seems inevitable until they fix this glitch in the system
