2023 due to the recent shutdown of s1x boiii sm2 iw6x initiated by activision i ask every single true cod fan by cod fan i mean person who played real cods the ones before 2014 to boycott the game and stop supporting these cheapskates any old cod is sold for full price and for some ridiculous price even on sale moreover the old cods have security problems by which i mean that you can get your vital data stolen by simply logging into the game when fans create clients which have better matchmaking safer connection with no sbmm activision just takes it down because they ubderstand that nobody wants to play their new games which i call bundle of duty people want to play real cod the cod that we all love and respect not some cashgrab with horrendous sbmm f to call of duty as a series activision is probably the best company at making their fans quit the title
