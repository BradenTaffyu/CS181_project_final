2017 story is as fun as a cod campign can be zombies is really fun multiplayer is pretty much dead on pc despite pc being the best platform for a fps imo however with all the lottery for new weapons and skins game feels like a huge cash grab on top of it still costing full price at the time of this review 8 5 17 the game has been broken several times in many updates and now doesn t even run for a lot of people stay away go play mw2 or the original cod4
