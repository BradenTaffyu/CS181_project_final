2019 the campaign s story is basically nonexistent the coop mode is busted and the second you re farther away than half a country from eachother the game starts lagging in both zombies and campaign mode if the servers don t crash then the game itself does which should be not acceptable from a game made in 2015 running on a gtx 1070 and 16 gigs of ram not to mention an ssd a second of network outage can cause the game to completely freak the f out and kick you out to the menu screen saying you lost connection even though you regained in a second after you lost it note also that this can happen at any point i learned that halfway into the origins easter egg and while we re at zombies mode who the f thought it was a good idea to not even slightly gimp the difficulty when a person is attempting to do one of their tens of thousands of 900 step easter eggs that require you to look at a guide every few seconds to even get anywhere case in point 30 rounds into eisendrache solo doing the last step of filling the keeper s stone tablets about a 100 zombie kills required in a specified area by shooting zombies with incredibly broken arrows that kill them or stun them basically instantly and forever and the game decides alright this is a great time to spawn something with an auditory warning that s un hearable with that many zombies around you that can tank 15 hits from the most broken bow in the level and kill you in about 3 seconds if he gets too close with his flamethrower in addition to the 900 zombies currently surrounding him and the explosive dogs that we force to constantly spawn every few seconds at that easter egg step to give multiplayer any credit would be bold of me seeing as half if not all the weapons are sold by random chance in microtransaction crates for abusively high prices in addition to the game costing 100 bucks and thats if the servers don t kick you out cause the host is in some random hole at the opposite end of the milky way tl dr the campaign has no thought put into it the game crashes randomly if not the whole game then the server connection they made the zombie easter eggs soloable but way too fu hard when you do so the multiplayer sells microtransactions left and right for most of the weapons included and to add salt to the wound the game is 4 years old but costs 100 bucks for the complete edition in addition to said mt s edit whoops and now it s a massive data risk to play this 100 euro product that is still on the official steam stores any game that allows people you join a lobby with to literally install malware on your computer should be immediately booted off the store until the issue is fixed or permanently with how much activision loves fixing old products right
