2023 did paradox make this game psa this is my general review of the entire warhammer total war trilogy because immortal empires is the only thing i give a about 304 77 300 whole pound sterling is how much it would cost to unlock every single faction and character across the map i get that its a big game and i can understand it being expensive but hello the micro transactions being more expensive than the base games is already taking the piss even if you ignore the limited map size and faction choice in an attempt to sink all your money into buying all three games immortal empires what i ve been waiting for since the first warhammer total war was announced when my balls hadn t even dropped yet is unfortunately still lacking the ai is more autistic than all the discord moderators of the world combined and by turn 100 it feels like a repeat of a random 20 stack alone appearing out of nowhere after the ai walks to timbuktu and back crossing through territory owned by neighbours they are also at war with just to sack one of my settlements on the opposite side of the country diplomacy for me is completely useless unless i want to assimilate a legendary lord of a same race faction or try to be at peace with a completely random chaos nation across half the world that declared war on me to then invade me from 100000 miles away the end game crisis events while imo is a pretty brainless and easy way out method of making the game have some sort of actual goal are quite fun but once again ruined by the player targeting agenda that all the ai have ingrained into them and makes it a constant loop of turn by turn fighting settlement by settlement reconquering so it takes about 3 hours just to push back a handful of settlements thankfully i only bought this game while it was on sale opting for a game key website to get the second one because it still was a better price than the christmas sale if i did however buy it when it first came out i imagine i could write even more about how much worse everything was when it first released which was months later than they said they would release it regardless of all this i am going to continue playing this in an endless loop of playing different factions to turn 130 where i will then get bored and switch to another because i hate myself more than i hate this game thanks for readingno tl dr because if you re debating whether or not you should get something this expensive you should put some thought into it
