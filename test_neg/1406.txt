2022 80 hours into a single character mostly into a faith build i don t think i would tell someone on the fence to buy this game but i would recommend it if they could get it on sale for 40 off or more it s a game for diehard fans of the series of which i would count myself but it fails to perform past the initial few areas the game itself is rocky on pc at its best moments the port feels like it was an afterthought and i do wish i had picked this up on my ps5 which is not something that i would commonly say large drops in framerate when some enemies cast spells hitches when cutscenes transition from scene to scene luckily i have not encountered any serious difficulties in general gameplay but i do dip below 60fps commonly it s obviously manageable but i m somewhat disappointed overall with this aspect the gameplay is the same core loop as we have been playing for the past decade in the souls series this isn t a negative but it has me beg the question of what people are seeing when they call elden ring the 2022 goty or an industry level game changer there s barely anything new here you can jump you can be stealthy to a degree you have a somewhat temperamentally controlled horse the attacks feel the same the peaks and troughs of weapon powerlevels feel very similar man that first uchigatana i found really trivialized most of limgrave much like the uchi in every souls game ever and the core loop feels very similar incantations and sorceries are very very cool and generally quite rewarding to use in this game hence why i went with a faith build smiting nerds with lightning bolts and giant red lightning stakes or massive exploding fireballs is extremely satisfying and probably why i made it this far but nothing else is really that innovative sans the sekiro stance breaking mechanic the complete reliance on the hold sword in air for 12 seconds while the tarnished attempts to read your move style of attacking really cuts this game down for me bosses and larger enemies hold onto their swings for dear life just to bait you into a roll and catch you halfway through recovering it feels lazy like they discovered this was a viable option wherever it first made its appearance in the series and they decided that was the thing that was needed to truly make the game difficult the oppressive aggression some enemies have is exhilarating and keeps you on your toes whereas this kind of mechanic just serves to frustrate a player when they get caught and have to then watch a 13 hit combo delete their character the level design in this game takes a sharp decline in the later portions of the game limgrave liurnia mostly altus leyndell these are all fantastic zones mountaintops of the giants could be better caelid whatever that is it ain t it chief lake of rot hilarious loved it what a great throwback to places like the valley of defilement and blighttown even though this kind of thing exists in every single souls game and we should be expecting it i even enjoyed mt gelmir as it housed a very fun questline and the obligatory stormbringer fight but then we see zones like the subterranean shunning grounds ok it was fun to kill the horrible npc here farum azula got dayum dragons gibbing my 30 vigor ass because i m too stupid to learn how to dodge when i m not looking at them the consecrated snowfield hur dur blizzard haha remember frigid outskirts btw co director of dark souls 2 and the haligtree why is everything suddenly so resistant to my lightning and it truly sucks the fun out of the game these areas can be beautiful have wonderful soundtracks and interesting artistic qualities but they are such slogs to get through it no longer feels fun to progress the nosedive in quality of level design is unfortunate in such a highly anticipated game the crafting and ash of war systems are fantastic if nothing else i hope other rpg style games take note of the ability to swap infusions and skills on the fly like this crafting throwable pots or knives or arrows with materials you collect is a great way to reward exploration and being the type of person to mash triangle to pick everything up off the ground the open world formula really works for this series though elden ring itself suffers from some pacing issues if you can call it that exploration feels rewarding but once you progress further into the game it becomes less so and the world slowly becomes more sparse this made it less appealing for me to explore some of the aforementioned slogs and not just try to blitz the enemies and find ways to avoid ones that i didn t particularly want to waste 15 lightning bolts on all in all i think this game is worth trying if you re a fan of the series and there are definitely some great and rewarding moments but the fact of the matter is that it s the same game we ve been playing for a decade with not much new to offer aside from an open world that deviates slightly from the barren ubisoft style formula if you re looking for something new and exciting you might find what you re looking for here but i have my doubts tl dr git gudder than me and enjoy the game but i think it s a 6 5 to 7 10 at best and i would probably rate this just above ds2 in terms of how much i enjoy playing it and you know this is just my opinion right
