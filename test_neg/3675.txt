2016 this game is awesome if only it wasn t for rockstar and their non existant customer support broken ban system here s a video that sums it up quite nicely people who didn t cheat get permanently or temporarily banned for no reason while lots of hackers cheaters just get away with what they re doing and the support doesn t seem to care much either wait did i say support what support however the singleplayer mode is very well made and i enjoyed every second of it but the anti cheat system really urgently needs to improve
