to the developers at netease games i appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on once human as someone who has invested over 243 hours into the game it is clear that there is great potential but there are several areas that can be improved below are my thoughts and suggestions regarding specific aspects of the game all provided with the intent of fostering improvement 1 terrainthe terrain in once human creates unnecessary frustration roads that are at extreme angles 30 40 degrees are challenging to navigate with vehicles and certain obstacles like trash piles or road barriers cause frequent collisions consider removing or making these objects destructible as they detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience additionally terrain issues arise when roads cross rivers without proper bridges forcing players to swim just to respawn their vehicles a smoother design would avoid these immersion breaking moments moreover some locations like the gaia military base allow players to become soft locked although the unstuck option helps preventing this entirely with invisible walls or path blocking mechanisms would improve the overall gameplay 2 water environmentthe water environment in once human feels lackluster waterfalls except for one in eternaland are poorly animated and lack flow mechanics which undermines immersion it feels particularly odd that players can swim up waterfalls an issue that breaks realism improving water mechanics with flow physics and fixing the jarring zigzag looking textures on the edge of the waterfall would enhance immersion additionally the absence of underwater plant life is noticeable lakes and seas feel lifeless without algae or other plants and the addition to ocean life adding these elements could make underwater exploration more engaging and introduce new resources 3 buildingbuilding is a core element of survival games but the mechanics in once human can be frustrating the build limit for upgraded territory terminals could be possibly raised to allow players to get more creative with their structures moving your territory is also an issue as it often can t be placed where desired leading to additional frustration expanding available wallpapers adding a 1x2 horizonta and vertical ceiling option and making building mechanics more cooperative would allow players to fully enjoy the creative aspects of the game 4 npcsthe ai of human npcs leaves much to be desired their detection speed is overpowered but they also seem unaware of their surroundings creating awkward encounters their movement is robotic and unrealistic and they pose little challenge in combat due to poor use of cover monsters suffer from similar issues they lack the threat they should pose in a survival game and feel like simple obstacles giving both human and monster npc s a more unpredictable behaviour pattern make them more aggressive would push players to choose between stealth or aggressive combat would make encounters more dynamic and engaging 5 vehiclesvehicles are a great addition but they need improvement for such a large world the current speed and handling feel inadequate the addition of helicopters or gyrocopters would open up exciting new gameplay opportunities including aerial combat regarding storage vehicle trunk sizes should be increased the mountain off roader for example should have 20 slots instead of 12 while motorcycles should have at least 4 slots using saddlebags similarly the headtrailer truck should have the ability to carry more storage crates the handling speed and physics of vehicles need serious attention colliding with small objects can send vehicles flying leading to unnecessary damage additionally vehicles don t feel like they have weight which makes driving less satisfying auditory improvements are also critical the sound of the vehicles is underwhelming with most engines sounding weak and unrealistic for example the retro coupe muscle car sounds more like a lawnmower than a v8 engine vehicle same goes for the mountain off roader a rework of the sound design along with improvements to vehicle physics would greatly enhance the driving experience by making the engine sound more aggressive 6 settingsthe removal of the render distance option is an issue especially for players who like to play with high magnification scopes reintroducing this feature would help with immersion as current render issues lead to floating objects and weapons lighting specifically on the rosetta faction breaking the visual experience in addition some settings are locked and unchangeable limiting player control over how they experience the game allowing more customization in settings would improve player satisfaction 7 gunplay and meleewhile guns feel powerful the mechanics need refinement the lack of a short and long reload mechanic combined with the absence of tactical reloads reduces the realism and depth of the combat system adding more nuanced mechanics like bipod deployment and weapon sway would make gunplay more challenging and rewarding similarly the melee and takedown animations become repetitive quickly more variety in animations would keep combat fresh the inclusion of hand to hand combat for unarmed players would also enhance the survival aspect of the game 8 movement mechanicsadding the ability to go prone would enhance both stealth and combat especially when combined with the improvements to bipod attachment mechanics which players should be in control of by pressing a set key prompt e g turning on off a tactical flashlight laser or the deployment of a bipod combined with the ability to determine scope magnification simply by scrolling the mouse wheel like in so many other games where it is a typical standard mechanic players could use this features to better strategize in combat scenarios 9 misspellings and unvoiced characters npc smisspellings in the game are immersion breaking and should be corrected unvoiced characters npc s also break the immersion please fix this to make the game more natural 10 seasonal reset mechanicthe seasonal reset poses a major issue for casual players and discourages time investment as progress is wiped after each reset either the reset system should be removed or the reset period should be significantly extended don t wipe the servers and take away upon the progress the players have invested so much time in but add something every season to make the game appeal time and time again conclusiononce human has a lot of potential but the issues outlined above prevent it from being a game that i can recommend without reservations addressing the terrain issues improving npc ai enhancing vehicle mechanics and refining the gun play and building systems would take the game to the next level the addition of helicopters the ability to go prone and more customizable settings would all make the game feel more dynamic and immersive i hope you find this feedback helpful and look forward to seeing improvements in future updates despite its flaws the game has captured my attention and with some key adjustments it could truly become an outstanding survival experience thank you for your consideration sincerely cl4ssicpl4yer
