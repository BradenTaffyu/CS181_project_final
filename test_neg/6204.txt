2022 dead by daylight is an asymmetrical 4v1 pvp game based on classic horror movie tropes it is also an absolute time consuming grind survivors must complete generators and escape killers must prevent them killers vary widely with their abilities and perks survivors are solely reliant on their perks and items they play much the same as each other there are no other game modes than this there are three in game currencies bloodpoints character survivors and killers progression iridescent shards player progression auric cells purchased with real money as well as purchasable dlc the base game includes 5 killers and 5 survivors with 30 survivors and 27 killers total as of march 2022 additional characters must be purchased via dlc or the in game store with auric cells 500 iridescent shards 9000 or if you re feeling a bit devious family share unlocks dlc three perks per character are locked behind their respective dlc also bloodpoints are the gameplay currency which are used in the bloodweb every character has their own bloodweb it is used to unlock and level up perks unlock items and add ons level each character max 50 option to prestige three times resetting the characters level and items for a chance at supposedly better items and perks perks must be levelled three times to have maximum effectiveness and they also have to be unlocked on their original character before you can potentially find it in another character s bloodweb at approximately 150 hours i have roughly eight characters max level and 30 000 iridescent shards or enough to purchase three more characters much like the rest of the game the season pass the rift is also extremely grindy and split into two parts the free part with sparse rewards and the part you pay for with 1000 auric cells you do get those cells back if provided you complete the pass but it still requires you to have a lot of time and dedication tomes alleviate some of that grind they also encourage different game styles and provide challenges but some of the tasks are still grindy matchmaking is broken and the game will reward selfish play over skilled play toxicity and saltiness is very high within the player base also the developers are extremely out of touch and do not listen to the community nor criticism so be prepared for that if you still genuinely want to give this game a try i want people to understand that i do shockingly enjoy this game it s fun a little bit addictive intense and at times genuinely terrifying playing with friends in custom matches is hilarious i cannot however recommend something with so much content locked behind a grind and paywalls let alone the other issues with the game final notes i wish there was more map variety you cannot acquire content from stranger things anymore but the perks are available in base game now other ips will likely disappear too there are items in the bloodweb that are almost literally useless it runs on spaghetti code and has the strangest bugs the seasonal events are great
