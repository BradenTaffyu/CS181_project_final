2023 shader cache loading issue still present in 2023 company shows no signs of fixing this issue despite this being a modern title released by a modern company essentially no matter your hardware this game will stutter due to poorly implemented shader loading there is no guaranteed work around some players will run this game smoothly on an i5 with a 3050 and some players will experience frame drops to 2 fps for 1 second every 5 seconds while running this game on a 4060 ti with 16 gb of ram valve was actually aware of this issue and fixed it for the steam deck version of this game yet somehow over a year in bandai wont fix something as amateur as this the content of the game is spectacular but to ignore the disgusting state of the port long after the initial release date is unfair to the total review of this game and that is why i still cannot recommend this game despite it having the potential to be enjoyable
