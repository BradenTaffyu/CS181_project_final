2023 to the people who bought a pc for the first time and you want this to be the game to try out let me stop you right there consider this a warning if you want to simply enjoy the campaign it s excellent on pc there is no shame getting this game for the story alone however if you plan to play multiplayer you are better just playing online on console the multiplayer is in a middle of a massive decline cheaters own the servers bot spam is extremely bad and rockstar games still expects you to buy into their crappy sharkcard system it s pretty much a scam they aren t doing much if anything about it so if you expect to have fun in multiplayer here s my advice cheat if you don t you ll hardly ever be able to play in a public lobby it s best to not even bother trying it out
