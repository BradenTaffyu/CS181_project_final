2017 i like this game i like to load up gta o and cruise around do the occasional mission and on the blue moon where three of my buddies are also on maybe we will do some missions i can t recommend this game because it s rockstar s magnum opus ii it is them telling everybody exactly how they will develop their future projects there was no single player expansions there was no addition of new towns or map changes there are barely no interiors or fast food i believe this game might have as many in door areas as gta 2 a top down isometric game which almost entirely due to the perspective takes place outside on the streets its comedy was already dated when it came out it felt much like rockstar as a company old and tired rockstar stripped everything out of max payne 3 which made it max payne an intriguing story good characters dark comedy and a very dark satire on film noir similarly with their own ip rockstar has managed to strip out of gta what made it fun shark cards are disgusting lack of sp additions and updates are appaling load times server latency etc are so awful that you ll spend as much time loading as you are playing i am also playing this with a 1070gtx at only 1080p so it is not an issue of poor hardware every weapon in a category feels the same and the ones that feel unique only do so because of how stupidly underpowered and weak they are rewards for completing heists jobs etc are not scaled to the new content there have been no new heist missions or series since its initial heist update this game upon its release was shabby and i was eager to give it lots of breathing time to update and polish after a couple of years now it s clear rockstar decided to take a very poor direction this game is anti consumer
