updated review after putting in 100 hours is game good yes is game worth 70 probably not it s dragon s dogma and all the good that comes with that but it has a lack of monster variety compared to the first game no real end game to speak of and performance issues on top of the capcom microtransactions this feels like it should have been a 40 early access release with promises of better performance and more content to come in the future but it isn t they want 70 now with no real plans to deliver what you would expect from a sequel 12 years later
