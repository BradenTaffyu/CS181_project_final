2023 i have been utterly engrossed in wallpaper engine for 213 long arduous hours i have not slept i have foregone my wife she has taken the kids and with them the one true morsel of sanity left within this derelict shell i previously attributed as my body the voices are ever growing louder and louder and s i l e n t the scratching ever picking away at the bricks that make up the temple of my mind i do not know for how long i must endure this torment but i know that for each hour i spend browsing wallpaper engine for edgy anime girl wallpapers i lose a fragment of my reasoning and thus my humanity for without reasoning we are no better than the animals in which we exploit for our own vanity and contentment
