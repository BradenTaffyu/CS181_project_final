2020 good game but do not i repeat do not buy the battlepass this season they ve changed it to be 4 10x slower to gain levels than last season which means most people won t be able to finish it without playing 5 hours per day they want to force people to purcase the battle pass tiers instead of earning them also the mathmaking is predators and other top level players in almost every match instead of matching them against each other they get to destroy low mid skill players instead not fun at all their servers are also crap constant stutters and higher ping than any other game
