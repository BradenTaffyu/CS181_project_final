2021 this game is not for everyone while i have spent at time of writing 200 hours on this game i would point out that there are aspects of this game that i have obviously enjoyed as i d hope to be the case for anybody that has spent a little over a whole week of their life playing i don t want people to be necessarily discouraged from playing this game by my review but i want people to know what exactly they are getting themselves into beforehand the issues i have will be listed in three parts in this order the games difficulty the time the game demands out of your life and the obtuse secrets involved but first a short rundown of my experiences before hand i had my first clear after getting about 70 hours of experience into the game i think i cleared with 6 or 7 orbs at the point of the map that i d explored and regrettably my rapid fire wand was also my drill wand i had to reset the game several times due to performance issues on later runs i learned that this could be offset by not making a luminous drill wand also shoot ranged bouncy projectiles while playing the game seems to encourage teleporting in out of holy mountains or drilling your way out of them so that you can come back later to edit your wands this means a ton of backtracking which i quickly got accustomed to after my first clear i decided to install some mods that would save me time such as more storage space for spells and items as well as a free tinker with mods anywhere perk at the start of the run i understand that this might seem like cheating to some players and i admit that aspects of this can at times feel a bit scummy but ultimately this level of cheating matters little in this game with how fragile the character is it doesn t matter if you re carrying around 5 tablets and 13 potions they aint gonna help ya tinkering with wands anywhere exists in the game and generally feels like a better way to play as you wouldn t need to spend as much time backtracking already explored areas this perk helps speed things up but if you can t find good wands or spells it aint gonna help you either around 100 hours in on a really successful and long run i picked up what i thought was going to be a spell and it was an elemental essence this started exploding things around me and i nearly died i turned off the game and installed another mod that would allow me to remove perks for a long while i d only used it the once but never actually removed the mod later i realized that using this mod would allow the gambling perk to generate infinite perks i did so once to see how op i could get didn t matter cause i got polymorphed and instantly died to exemplify my point about cheating while it doesn t feel good to do the game doesn t care and will still destroy you my max orb count is 21 and during that run i had started with every perk i could have wanted i d built god wands and had climbed a secret area twice for some special wands spent 7 hours doing this i just wanted to see what a max orb boss would have looked like to fight to see if i could make a wand that could beat him without looking online didn t get the chance polymorph and cheating aside let s talk about the main issues i have starting with that difficulty 1 difficulty i think that this is self evident by the fact that the game has weeded out half of the players before they were even able to get to the third stage everything can and will kill you you try to fire a wand you pick up and the spells are in the wrong order or configuration you re dead you step on the wrong pixel you re on fire spell bounces and hits a crate of explosives run over sometimes while experience can solve these problems sometimes things you can t explain or had no chance to deal with will end your run try to fire a wand that you know to be a safe wand at a distance but there is a single pixel that you couldn t see against the dark background that your projectile hit and you explode on the spot getting hit by enemy projectiles that spawn off screen or when an enemy unit picks up a wand that has an earthquake or nuke spell in it and fires it once these is nothing that can be done about some of these potentially game ending events 2 time investment this game doesn t care about your time i understand that rogue like games have permadeath and are supposed to be difficult but the sheer volume of content needed to actually complete the game takes so much time that you d have to be a monster to do it in one sitting which from what i can tell most rogue likes are made for the fact that you can lose everything after playing one file for over 7 hours is one of the most punishing things you can experience from a video game if you just want to get to the bottom and clear the boss this aint a huge issue but if you actually want to explore the bulk of the content this game offers you need to be fully ready to spend nearly a whole 24 hour day of your life on a single run some streamers that i have watched have taken 18 hours and i d argue that they are experts at this game to get the secret content behind this investment wall 3 speaking of secrets you won t complete any bonus content in this game without looking parts of it up you may come across notes on the wall in an area of the game and wonder about it but you d be suicidal to actually willingly explore the area the key is in without a purpose to go there i don t know if this was a glitch but when i finally obtained the musical notes i went back to that wall and the notes were gone i didn t think i d have to write them down other secrets are just as obtuse i don t want to spoil anything just in case what i ve mentioned so far seems like a great cbt time but there is a sequence of events involving statues that i thought were just decorations until i saw somebody kick one while i respect difficulty in videogames considering that i ve played vanilla and modded minecraft on hardcore several times in the past these traits tied together like they are in this game leads to a feeling that is generally more punishing than rewarding there are several things i think you must ask yourself before you ready yourself to sit down and play this game do i have a reaction time good enough to dodge projectiles fired from off screen am i smart enough or willing to learn the spell wrapping and speed augmenting wand building mechanics am i willing to let multiple hours of my life blink away instantly am i generally a lucky person if any of those are a no you might not have a good time with this game if you read my whole review thank you i don t mean to on this game but i don t know if i have much will to keep at it at this point i must commend the designers for making something that i got 200 hours of playtime out of was it enjoyment some of it sure maybe most but it s bittersweet update i have put in an additional 400 hours of playtime i have just now collected the final achievement i stand fully by everything i previously wrote
