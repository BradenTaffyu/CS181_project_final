2023 do not buy any ubisoft games ubisoft is the worst company that has ever existed i have no clue why it s so hard for ubisoft to just let us play their damn games on steam ubisoft enjoys torturing users by making them use their goofy launcher in order to play their games ubisoft is super anti consumer and the current ubisoft publisher not developer is nothing but a cancer waiting to be removed
