2023 this game is a handful of missions in this game are boring 80 of the time combat is simple and makes kinda sense but very much unfun not enough content is being added because devs are lazy and adding new mtx shop items are easier and more profitable all you can do is farm chests for hours only to get ganked solo play is almost impossible no pvp pve server choices mean if you play solo you are doomed progressing ranks will take a long time even if you are lucky and don t get ganked you finally returned to the island to turn in chests without getting ganked now you will have to carry all of your chests one by one for an hour teaming up is also impossible you are 4 friends but want to do 2 ships instead of 1 tough either get 1 big ship or don t play together at all ship choices are not flexible at all the only fun game mode was arena and they removed it because of reasons honestly devs missed a huge opportunity with this game there aren t many pirate games out there and this could ve been the best pirate game ever made but instead the game has the same game loop since launch content updates are usually a tall tale which has like 2 3 missions most of which are reskins of each other anyway but there will be a lot of cosmetic updates ship customization is cosmetic only you can t make your own pirate and have to randomize until you find one you like the most there is no combat system to speak of there are 3 guns and they have different damage numbers which is a pretty basic and uninteresting system if you have some friends it can be casual fun for maybe 10 20 hours but other than that it s a very niche and limited fun game
