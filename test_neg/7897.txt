2022 after playing 264 hours of this game here is why i don t like this game a typical day of me trying to play the game is the following i have at my disposal 1 hour and 20 minutes to do a quest to raise my reputation with the order of souls after spending 30 minutes trying to find an average player who can vote on raising the flag and voyages i finally found someone we started the quest and we were attacked by some other players and they forced us to spend 20 min on pvp till we gave up and sunk our ship i could have continued to attack seeking vengeance still i decided to exit the game since i had at my disposal only 30 more minutes to do something entertaining instead of hunting kids thus i checked my library and i played something else the problem with this game is that it is for people who have a lot of free time at their disposal and are eager to do a lot of grinding if you are a working dad like me this is not a game that will entertain you in your small breaks i like some aspects of the game it is great fun when you play with friends but i grew on it to realise it wastes time with toxic pvp players eager to ruin your day that said the game promotes you to have this behaviour because you are a pirate thanks to this game i realised that pirates were bullies there was nothing noble about them like most players in the game still hate this game noob players make this game toxic
