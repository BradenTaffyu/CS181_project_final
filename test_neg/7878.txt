2023 i love the time when i can loot the islands do the quests and sell what i have found but honestly i am so dissapointed with this toxic pvp i have enough of looting for two and three hours just to lose over 100k to a stupid tryharder who is too lazy to do that job by himself they do not even give you time to talk or come to an accordance or anything at all they just board you ship and kill you three hours lost in a minute of course i could go for pvp and do the same annoying people however that is not my playstyle i do not want to be treated like that nor i want to to treat people like that either and i strongly believe this is so unfair for people who rather wants to spend time chilling than wasting other peoples time and nerves you just cannot chill i feel so paranoid to any ship in sight and even if there is not ship the shoot themselves with a canon to an isalnd to destroy your ship without noticing them at all my ingame purchase are definetly not worth it anymore
