2021 you have to be an absolute masochist to want to play this game from a bunch of money grubbing sociopaths who apparently don t care at all about pc players the game has been out over five years now and despite numerous content updates that are aimed at enticing you to pay real cash for in game dollars they have done all to address the rampant cheating and modding in the game modders can literally kill you and kick you out of the game for even trying to file a report against them what kind of stupid ass system is that and there are no viable means to report a player outside the game for the average non recording user i realized that rockstar could make even more money if they just sold an official first party modding menu that just gave you protection against other modders
