2023 this game got replaced the reviews are from cs go which was a way better game they replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game cs 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps community servers battle royale surf zombies mods and more additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when i cannot play at all which never happened in cs go this game is incomplete and shouldn t take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully new graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn t worth it i was hyped for cs 2 but it s not ready to replace cs go and they shouldn t remove an existing game and turn off cs go servers it should be just a separate game as it always was with cs series i feel scammed especially that i bought cs go when it was still a paid game they took a game i paid for and replaced with some silly remake
