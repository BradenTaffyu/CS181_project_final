2021 i dont mind the grind i actually loved the way warframe was when it was ran under de alone however this prime resurgence event isnt worth my time or my money in fact this is showing tencents impact since they bought de sure most of the updates have been good or at least passable up to this point but now i honestly cant say i recommend this game if the game continues this downward trend with tencent at the helm the game will fail i have 3k hours on ps4 and 256 hours on pc as of right now and i have never seen such a blatant cash grab event it genuinely is starting to feel like a mobile game im gonna vote not only with my wallet but also my time say no to this cash grab style event edit i came back for new war as i said i would had to farm up for my void rig which took me 16 hours of game time now im waiting 12 hours for the build then ill make additions to my review i still wont recommend the game im wary of what kind of tencent is gonna pull with warframe but im still gonna play here and there since im already mostly end game anyways railjack is fun and is my main content i run do i advise getting the game i think its an ok game there s lots to do decent story and its beautiful lots of awesome cosmetics but its a grind fest if your unlucky a lot time gating is on par with mobile games and big updates take years to drop and are almost always mediocre on release then get fleshed out later off that alone i say give it a shot if you dont mind the cons but be wary of the new management tencent is still at the helm and im keeping a close eye on what they do i personally dont recommend this game but ive put in the time im gonna at least see the story through till they finish it update after finishing the new war quest decent story gameplay was lackluster but i do like some of the new additions and that i was free to choose who i wanted back and such this game has so much potential and this quest was so underwhelming because of how much potential it had was it worth all the grind absolutely not also when will they reduce the time gating its annoying especially when paired with several days of grind due to bad luck
