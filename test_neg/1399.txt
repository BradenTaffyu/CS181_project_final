2022 this review pains me to write as i really loved the game and wished to enjoy my time with it unfortunately there are many short comings to this game at its current state that i just can not give a good review for major spoiler warning aheadmy opinions without spoilers will be at the tl dr section at the bottom let s first get this out of the way the map design and visuals are gorgeous my first steps into leyndll capital and the stunning nokron and nokstella cities gave me a feeling i ve never felt in any of the hundreds of the games i ve played this is no doubt the most immersive and enjoyable world fromsoftware has ever made the amount of content in this game is also unfathomable the amount of details and secrets such as the hidden sellia tunnel or the countless talismans and quests has made me eager to explore every nook and cranny of this world the sound design is also stellar not only are the boss soundtracks absolutely enjoyable my favorite without a doubt is the tibia mariner s theme but the sound design in general is mesmerizing the latin chants of the man bats or the cries of the cowmans to name a few are hypnotic to say the least however there are many shortcomings to this state that made my experience unenjoyable let s first talk optimization as i feel this applies to the most amount of users the optimization at the game s current state is simply horrendous per my experience the game could rarely run smoothly at 60fps with the lowest settings on my gtx 1070ti with 16gb ram and i7 8700 i m also encountering frame drops or frame skipping in every boss fight granted these are not the best specs but they are at least better or at on par with average graphic cards these days a friend of mine who has a 3080 and i9 core could rarely achieve great frame rates at high settings and others who had poorer specs could barely run the game at all ofcourse turning the resolution down and altering graphics files could net an increase in frame rates but players shouldn t be forced to juggle nay choose between immersiveness and playability next is the boss designs don t get me wrong lots of the boss designs are incredibly amazing and interesting especially true of the demigods however this only lasts for the early mid portion of the game many of the minibosses are over recycled and most bosses just become a war of attrition or worse luck i understand that this is a huge open world game and there are limited resources for development but when you are fighting your 7th ulcerated tree spirit or 6th erdtree avatar the encounters themselves simply feel unrewarding and boring i am also particularly disappointed with the reuse of the naturalborn of the void the main appeal of this lovecraftian scorpion is that it s supposed to be a one time encounter with a being that should not exist in the game world it should be horrifying and provide only a hint of what could exist in order to create a lingering dread and fear in the players however when it is reused again in a simple ice cave it just destroys the whole experience at least for me the bosses are also extremely unbalanced i know i know git gud just dodge bro but it feels like this title heavily caters towards sorcerers and abusing summons for the early game the game doesn t expect you to have good spells good stats or good summons and so the bosses feel fair and close range attacks feels powerful this is flipped completely in the later portion for my playthrough i was using a hybrid int build i could simply summon a 10 oleg knight have it tank all the damage and spam full moons until whatever is infront of me is obliterated this made the game uninteresting and so i switched to a strength faith build and i can say that it was completely hell on earth it feels as through all of the boss attacks are targeted towards melee players the magma wyrm attacks astel voidborn aoes and many other attacks is nonthreatening to ranged users and lethal to melee users because of the summons the rests between each attack from bosses are cut extremely short compared to other souls games as they expect you to be playing essentially 2 on 1 or 2 on 2 this has created a dilemma in which playing without summons and melee builds is extremely challenging while playing with summons as a sorcerer is extremely unfun and repetitive also most bosses are not challenging by design but are simply scaled up to one shot you if you don t dodge random bs ability 476 like ffs why does the black knife ring leader have like 500million health while being able to track and one shot you with his jump aoes i d like to bring up sekiro in comparison sekiro did the gameplay system perfectly at least imo where the boss attacks don t feel random but is a challenge of skills if you fail to parry that s on you if you fail to recognize the chain combos that s on you if you parry everything you get an opportunity to retaliate or heal in eldenring it s not the same let s say you get hit by ability a you are now faced with two decisions heal or not heal due to the short times between attacks it is essentially a gambit a random roll of a dice of whether you get punished for healing or not this is as i mentioned because summons exist and so the game is balanced to the summons the fights themselves turn into a battle of attrition of whoever runs out of health or flasks first and whoever is the luckiest instead of a true dance and true combat of skill questslastly the quest system is also abominable it is unwelcoming to veteran souls players and completely confusing to new players considering this very well could be the first souls game or even the first ever game that someone plays though i did enjoy doing some quests and feeling like satisfied after linking the dots between questlines how on earth are you supposed to progress main quest lines such as seluvi s plot without looking up a guide to find a hidden tunnel in the billions of ruins or how do you know without exploring for hundreds of hours where brother corhyn went after he just simply left the roundtable without even a hint of where he s heading ofcourse the game s not supposed to let you know everything but at least give a slight hint or direction you explore and finish the entire game without completing a single questline even when you are ecstatic to do so tl drthe game is immersive and interesting with jaw dropping visuals and some unique mechanics however due to the atrocious optimization poor balancing and perplexing quest system i simply cannot recommend it at its current state i emphasize at its current state because i wish that most of the complaints will be addressed and i would love to absolutely adore this game however it is sadly not the case right now that said i m going to be playing more eldenring because despite my complaints it is pretty fun
