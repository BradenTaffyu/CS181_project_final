extremely minor spoilers for story and post game dragons dogma 2 can ultimately be summed up as a disappointment the short and sweet of it is that what people wanted was a fixed and expanded version of ddda and instead what we got was the first game with all of its problems released again it still has great combat but it doesn t have better combat and in every other regard it is a sidegrade at best or a downgrade story they tried to make it better but in doing so they just made it more complicated and it ended up being worse ddda s story is bad but it was a story this one is really not a story it is a beginning and an end characters again ddda did not have great characters by any stretch of the imagination but they were characters they were all stereotypes and predictable but a stereotype is more of a character than nothing and they each had quest lines that you could follow throughout the game so they felt more part of your journey where as in dd2 you speed through their quests if they even have any and then drop them for the rest of the playthrough the dragon going to separate this from characters because this is a particularly important one grigori in the first game was amazing his introduction managed to show both that he was a terrifying force of nature but also that he was a very intelligent being that seemed to have more intention than destruction for destruction s sake he was intriguing and you felt his presence throughout the game everything you did was either in order to get to him or because of his workings in dd2 we don t even know the dragon s name and you honestly forget it even exists until he randomly pops out at the end of the game grigori was an iconic character in ddda dd2 s dragon is just another monster you fight exploration it is not bad but it only a sidegrade ddda s exploration was poor because there just wasn t much to explore dd2 s exploration is bad because the stuff that you explore is all very generic you don t have the cool and unique dungeons you had in the first game it is all just a series of caves that look exactly the sameendgame the one saving grace this game could have had is its combat but in order to do so you would need something to use that combat on the normal world is simply too easy pretty quickly and what you really want is an everfall bitterblack isle similar to ddda we don t have that in dd2 instead there is a timed post game that acts similarly but essentially means that you are limited in your fun because it will run out and then you will have to slog through the entire game again just to get the point where the combat isn t completely braindead because of how easy the regular world enemies are ultimately the only reason to get this game is if you cannot stand the graphics of the first because otherwise there is no reason to pick this game up over the 12 year old original because frankly that one is just more fun with less flaws
