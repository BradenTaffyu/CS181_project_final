2022 sea of thieves is a bad game i know that may seem perhaps dishonest coming from someone with 257 hours on the game however i can assure you that it is not sea of thieves certainly has its moments and it can be fun completing quests and sinking ships although i acknowledge this fact the majority of a player s time in sea of thieves will be spent either gathering resources sailing which gets really boring after a while lost on some quest or in combat although the first three tasks are clearly either boring or annoying the fourth task combat surely should make up for it right ship combat is pretty fun if you have friends who know what they are doing if you have incompetent friends you will have a bad time against sweaty players if you do not have anyone to play with you can play solo but it sucks to play against multiple players solo unless you are extremely experienced with a competent crew ship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you sidenote actual gun and sword combat in this game sucks due to sweats server lag the distance that ships usually are from each other spawn camping and hitreg which is very bad in this game at the end of my last part about combat i stated ship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you players in this game tend to run from combat very frequently and personally i can t blame them sinking in this game reset all of resources on your ship such as food wood and cannonballs which take time to regain the game practically incentivizes you to run away which isn t fun for either player overall sea of thieves can be fun under the right circumstances but because of the way the game incentivizes running from combat and the tedious actions that the player must take to be effective the game is not fun also when i first tried to play the game on a laptop the load times could take up to 30min to load into a server and half the time i would get kicked for being afk before i even loaded in
