2017 tl dr they have fixed 99 of the problems in the online by allowing business work and heists to be done in private sessionsi had a fairly negative review of the game for about five years i ve recently gotten back into it and the game is good the gameplay really wasn t ever bad repetitive maybe but not bad now you can run your businesses in private sessions which completely circumvents the prices for things i have made about 12 mil in the past week with my buddies my prior review i complained about making 12 mil in 100 hours of hardcore grinding the difference is that i haven t felt like the game was a job and i put half as many hours into it the online is totally worth it if you have friends there is easily 100 hours of content available and the singleplayer is as good as it was at launch if you had hesitations don t worry about it
