this game s barrier to entry for new players is ridiculous i love playing this game but i cannot recommend it to others because to play you have to buy so many different dlc if they introduced a shared mode where i could share my dlc with my friends this would solve so many issues for a game that s drawing lots of people through its co op play but as it stands right now the only reason i have all the content is because i ve been playing it for so long but i will never get to play with my friends without asking them to drop hundreds
