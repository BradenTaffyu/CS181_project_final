this is the single most exploitative anti consumer game i have ever played you can see that there is 300 dollars or something like that of dlc but they don t tell you about the various random hoops free dlc will have you jump through to get them and ones that are marked as free in the battlemode roster page are often not the most egregious example i just discovered being krell requires the purchase of warhammer 1 meaning a single subfaction of the vampire counts effectively costs 60 dollars because it needs warhammer 1 to summon the main unique aspect of the faction you get access to other things with the purchase of warhammer 1 but krell is all you get for vampire counts the game itself is incredibly fun its just genuinely if you are poor you cannot play a number of the factions tl dr the real cost off all the dlc is closer to 400 cause you also need to buy warhammer 1 and 2 to get all of the content and said content is sectioned in as anti consumer way a possible
