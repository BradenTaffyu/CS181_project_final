i love the warhammer universe i love the total war warhammer series i played the second one for hundreds of hours and i ll be playing this one for a long time too my reason to drop a negative review is not about the business practices of ca lately though it is a factor but rather because of the regional pricing it does exist but as a bare minimum prices should be way closer to recommended mena region prices no i don t care if your ceo needs another mansion
