2020 single player i have nothing to complain about really it s fun it s entertaining in it s own way and enough of a story to work through i like playing games with friends and the online is just trash it s so bad and infuriating the fact you have to be in a public online lobby to actually do stuff to make money and to then be met with people who are super out geared seeking you out to just blow you up while you stand no chance it s not fun i want to be able to roam around with my friends doing things with them alone not deal with people who think it s funny yo just blow you up over and over and over just find a new lobby no i shouldn t have to i should be able to enjoy the game with my friends without the irritation of people who think it s funny to switch on a hack to become invincible and one tap you for the single player the game is fun the online can smd
