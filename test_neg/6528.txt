2016 i wanna love this game i really do after over 100 hours of gameplay in two months since it s release when this game was so full of bugs it was almost hilarious i can t actually play this game anymore other than maybe a ritual every now and again i prefer to play survivor personally i have tried killer and i find it not the most fun experience because i find the killer has no loss for the game other than a pip or a rank as a survivor i feel the punishment for losing is so much harsher i get it though people who main killer have a different viewpoint which is all fine but at the end of the day i still want to have fun playing a game which this game got old after the couple updates came out and absolutely showed me how one sided this game truly is yeah they got rid of infintiy jukes but didn t touch killers minor debuffs but really it was hardly noticeable they have awesome concepts for killers and mediocre survivors ones the nurse was awesome and terrifying and nea crouches faster woop de doo might as well spend those points i was saving for meg or claudette the killers camp over 98 of the games it s breaks the total immersion after a while of how terrifying the killer is and you start to realize their just exploiting an old strategy from halo don t even bring up the topic to any discussions or you ll get git gud as a response seriously though when you re answer to a strat is to do gens faster as an answer it really isn t a fun concept especially for a game that pushes teamwork down your i will wait to see the storm the devs puts this game through wait for another sad survivor concept to be released after the let down from nea tldr you wanna buy this game to camp troll the discussions contemplate why you are doing this to yourself then buy all means give your money to a game that has raised over a million dollars in two months for an at best short quick play of struggling and dying at the face of your killer
