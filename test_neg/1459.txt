2022 disclaimer this review is based around week 1 impressions and may not be accurate moving forward as of july 2022 i have updated this review to fix some grammar and awkward sentences it s really kind of disappointing to see warhammer 3 in this state i m not even going to lie i was absolutely expecting it to be like this before it was released i ve been under the opinion that despite everyone saying they ve been working in this game for 5 years that they d actually probably been working on it the past 2 years if even that where to begin graphics the graphics are a downgrade from what they were before at least in my opinion things kind of have a cartoony vibe to them instead of the gritty realism look from warhammer 2 which i m not really a fan of if you look up warhammer 3 snow too bright you ll see what it was like half of the time i fought a snow battle where the ground was basically highly reflective glass that blinded me the campaign map looks pretty good but i don t really understand why they took the approach of changing up the graphics from the second game to be clear this is a personal opinion sieges as a massive dwarf player from warhammer 1 and 2 i take it as a personal insult that with all these talks of siege reworks we still don t have the ability to effectively position gunpowder units on walls or that sallying out to defend the walls while ranged units pepper the opposition isn t a tactic instead they took a look at bloons tower defense and decided that it d be a great idea to incorporate a tower defense system instead of actually overhauling sieges at all i m happy that a lot of sieges have bigger maps but the supply system feels like a massive gimmick to me we needed sieges to be redesigned from the ground up not the exact same with one new feature added minor sieges are basically just full on sieges now sure there are no walls but the same stupid tower defense game is available to the defender the minor sieges seem to offer superior defense to the main ones go listen to legendoftotalwar and other creators even they say that city sieges are more difficult than minor sieges now dedicated daemonsreworded july 2022 i have a gripe with the fact that chaos undivided has access to all daemon units i do not like that the only thing that makes the dedicated daemon factions unique are their faction effects and legendary lords 3 unique units for each dedicated faction would have sufficed and provided more incentive to anything besides undivided for more than a single run unit pathing responsiveness unit pathing is absolutely horrible again as a dwarf player i love ranged units especially gunpowder units while this has been a problem in warhammer 2 on occasion in the past in warhammer 3 it is the worst it has ever been every single time you give ranged units an attack order they do a little dance without failure this is absolutely always the case imo one of the big reasons you ll never see anyone utilize crane gunners iron hail gunners or streltsi is because they cannot reliably be attack ordered you are 100 better off just turning them and leaving them on fire at will and even then it s a 50 50 if they will shoot potentially fixed as of july 2022 couldn t tell ya unit mass unit mass is busted top tier cathay halberd infantry braced to take a charge from slaanesh horsies nope sorry the ai has the horses charge into and then pull through the infantry every time to hit your back line send out a terracotta sentinel beast to intercept a charging unit of daemonettes nope the middle of the unit gets knocked back the rest keep running like absolutely nothing just happened again right into your backline of crossbows i have 0 idea what they did involving unit mass but it needs to be tweaked substantially large entities just pass through crowds without contest when the ai is controlling them despite certain crowds being designed to take on large foes game ui who was in charge of the ui it s objectively a downgrade from warhammer 2 where before colors used to mean things now everything is red red red red red why why did they think it was a good idea to just obliterate faction unique ui and on top of it slap red onto literally everything else it just baffles me it s like they thought if they didn t do it that everyone would call it an improved clone of warhammer 2 with new races which hilariously enough is what everyone wanted just another horrible design decision the campaign don t even get me started on the realm of chaos campaign jesus whoever thought this was a good idea is really helpless then again no big deal right just because all four chaos realms are literally no fun to interact with and they couldn t even bother making each boss of the realm look like a representative of their respective god doesn t mean you have to interact with that system right if you don t like it just have a great time exploring the new map declaring war on your neighbors subjugate your enemies just like the older titles too bad 10 poopy portals just opened up across your entire empire that corrupt your land and make everyone extremely unhappy unless you manually send armies or heroes to go close them armies fight a battle heroes use gold and better yet despite the campaign implying that your advisor is the only one capable of helping you enter these realms every other major faction can do it too what a coincidence now you have a time race so even if you don t want to explore this mechanic you have to because if you don t you will literally not be allowed to play the game if an ai reaches the end and you don t take the opportunity to fight them your campaign will literally be a loss and you will be unable to play any further to top it all off ai factions will almost never close these portals meaning that if you don t own entire provinces or you have an ally they might have daemon armies wandering around as they spawn from the portals yay i believe this has been addressed as of july epilogue honestly i could go on turn times not being improved nearly at all balancing being all over the place tiny rosters compared to previous releases the game is fun you probably won t regret your purchase if you re new to the franchise but honestly even with that i really can t justify telling anyone to buy this game when warhammer 2 exists like i just can t feasibly understand why anyone would want to play whatever this is when warhammer 2 is out and is just flat out better more interesting races a bigger and more diverse map a gigantic modding community so yeah is it the worst game ever no but if i could summarize it in a single word it s disappointing i m sad that i was right about this title being trash compared to the last i m sad that they took all the advice and barely implemented any of the complaints that weren t superficial and easy to do ie diplomacy did actually improve summarygo buy warhammer 1 2 preferably on one of the many sales they have throughout the year if you are new to the franchise explore the races in the mortal empires gamemode in warhammer 2 and then pick up the dlc you find interesting when it goes on sale if you re bored to tears of warhammer 2 and want something new then buy warhammer 3 and enter it with low expectations get a lot of heroes so you can close the rifts when they open other than that the only reason i could possibly recommend for someone to get warhammer 3 is if they really love the daemons in the warhammer universe in that case you might enjoy this game a lot since daemons aren t really utilized in the previous titles see you guys when immortal empires comes out
