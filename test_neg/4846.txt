2022 easily the most poorly designed cod of all time multiplayer wise sad to see people praising such horrible choices movement bad gunplay bad visual recoil horrible visual clarity in gunfights horrendous the list could easily go on this is worse than the beta for me save your money i d argue bf 2042 is better than this that game is a nightmare as well
