2022 honestly if you are a solo or duo player i wouldn t play until they implement private servers the toxicity of this player base is worse than flint michigan water its sea of thieves not friends comes to mind when i find myself complaining about my misfortune but there really is nothing more frustrating than wasting hours of my limited time weekly to be sank for no logical reason if i ve no protection against toxic players who wish nothing more than to see my sloop at the bottom of the ocean regardless of loot then its not sea of thieves and it most certainly isn t sea of friends so its kinda just a sea of ssholes or sea of brain dead 5 year olds wanna try playing with randoms to increase your chances of not having your game session ruined and time wasted sorry we only got sea of xbox kiddies breathing and screeching down their mics incessantly until you cant take it anymore i love the game and i love the mechanics and at it s core i personally consider it a very good game if you ve got 3 other friends to play with so you can run a galleon then you wont have any problem enjoying it as a solo or duo player though there just isn t enough protection besides being an sshole myself from players who s sole intent is to simply ruin others play sessions rare want me back for season 8 private servers add more npc faction ships to provide a pve threat to certain areas of the map remember pirates of the caribbean online and how parts of the map were at war between spanish british and french navies fighting give us something like that and it validates private servers with no pvp for the love of flamebeard i just want to be left alone by 5 year olds screaming nonsense 2 psychotic girls screeching some whacko who forgot to take his meds athena griefers who won t even wait for you to finish the veil quest thats all thankyouedit so it s been about a month since i posted this review and i wanted to leave a little update to extend my opinions on this game and some of the comments made here to those saying git gud skill issue i m sorry i m not you i guess i simply don t have the time or will to focus on this game the same way that you do i have other priorities i enjoy the pve elements and the threats that pve provides is it easy yes thats why i asked for more pve threats in my initial review much of the comments to this review and rightfully pointed out by others thankyou are plain examples of the ignorance and toxicity so prevalent in the player base i believe this game can be pve and pvp i suppose i would propose a open play private group option when starting your journey at game launch similar to elite dangerous allowing those who feel pvp capable or ready for some higher risk to play freely as they would and those who would like to play without other players intervening to do so alone i literally do not see issue with this proposal and from what i ve seen people against this are typically so because it decreases the pool of lesser skilled players for them to easily prey upon using elite as an example the community is pretty stable on this topic and sees little issue with the separation of its player base in such a way as the game provides threats and risks in ways besides pvp i believe sot is at a design issue crossroads that it should have made a decision on long ago pve players are clearly frustrated by the strong push for pvp both from the developers in the form of pvp adventures and world design reapers and other pvp players this is a game that provides great pve elements that very few other games out there are able to hone in on some of these great pve elements are core to the cycle of playing this game digging up treasure sailing a ship freakin sea volcanoes meshing unavoidable pvp encounters with a vibrant and full pve game world with great pve core elements makes enjoying certain core elements rather difficult when the reward is so easily removed all my treasure being sunk after all we play games for the reward the frustration around this issue will persist until rare makes a decision and releases a statement on their intentions with pvp and private servers going forward the community instability and toxicity regarding important topics like this one and the way it treats this issue in game and out of along with the difficulties faced enjoying this games core elements while playing it have devalued this game for me that is why i do not recommend this game edit 2 because this seems to have dropped off the review page for sea of thieves i can only assume the devs or steam probably dont like what i have to say here despite being one of the most helpful reviews for people apparently i just wanted to say thankyou here to everybody who stayed civil in the comment section while also pointing out that it looks like they have no intention to change any of above mentioned issues for season 8 for that reason my review remains unchanged its sad to see a game i enjoyed so much for a handful of great design choices continue to implement multiplayer adventures and events that ruin the enjoyment of said design choices i really do wish i had a single player or private group option and ill stick by that no matter what you call me
