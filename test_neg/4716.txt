2023 yeah i mean you already know what i m going to say i really can t recommend it even if it s to play with friends and hang out that s the reason i bought this game in the first place conclusion after putting in a good amount of time into this game i can safely say that the developers actively hate their community and the lack of respect for their player base is far too apparent this is doubly so from what it looks like a lack of meaningful updates for some time extremely disappointing i know indie games that put up more of an effort especially for a studio with this many employees and sub studios in tandem maybe if they increase the time it would take to release a game by 2 4 years it would at least give them some time to put quality into their work although i doubt it would help anyways ranting aside for your own sake don t buy this game especially for 70 usd campaign the story is nothing to write home about just revisiting characters from previous games although they left massive plot holes and controversies in the story and it s so weird playing through it it genuinely makes no sense at times the campaign has lot of petty lame bugs that force you to do a full restart of the mission the prison break one for starters as you get stuck on the rafters not able to rappel down wasting about 20 minutes of your time they did have some slower more methodical sections which i appreciated but they were too far between only time the campaign felt interesting end mission was pretty much a letdown for me nothing to write home about gameplay and internal systems comparing this game to 2019 it s really improved in some respects where i did not expect the gun customization was outstanding along with the tuning although it doesn t really do that much especially when the game first came out along with the refined gunplay feels good enough for a modern cod recoil feels balanced and harder to control for certain guns which are a nice touch the main menu design is disgustingly bad not a surprise though as it was designed by the same dudes who made the ui for hulu the spawns feel really unfair sometimes spawning you in front of enemies or behind them which leads to really cheap kills games frequently crash especially with parties overall the gameplay is decent but far too inconsistent to be enjoyable there are some new maps but there is not a lot of variety player skins and paid weapon skins do not transfer over a lot of content from the previous games are just forgotten about it s like their many internal teams don t learn game to game though the objectively worst part about this game easily is the sbmm it s so horribly predatory pitting whole stacked squads up against one good player and a whole bunch of casual or newer players simply isn t fair and you can really feel it when you solo queue into a 6v6 after having a really good game or even a decent game the matchmaking is purely based on this idiotic ranking system which you re not able to see because the game hides a massive amount of stats for you it doesn t even prioritize ping so you often go up against very laggy players out of your country cash shop works perfectly well as always and without fail about the only complete feature in this game
