2022 so denovu is still causing performance issues as it was never removed since release also they are still fixing basic bugs that have been in the game since launch i m certain this game was not play tested at all 2 2 was supposedly the biggest patch yet most of the list of changes are fixes that again have been in the game since release like how have ca handled this game and its development probably worse than rome 2 at least they mostly fixed that fairly quickly
