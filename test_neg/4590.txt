2016 alright let me make this simple and sweet i ve put a lot of work into this title and i mean that in a literal sense between the amount of grinding that has to be done just for yourself much less for a clan but i did it built myself a nice 3 story dojo and decorated most of it before i even let someone in given it was my 2nd selling point for membership the rest of the time and often while dojo building i was trading i lived in that freaking trade channel for what seems like a prison sentence for manslaughter or something made thousands upon thousands of plat made myself my crap and all my officers at least moderately pretty got all the nifty crap like logos for the clan alliance i pushed as far as a single player could push and eventually i hit a wall where i realized i stopped caring a long time ago you ll enjoy this game for a long time i have no doubt of that but expect to hit that point where you get so confused by the choices devs make and how many things they decide to intentionally ruin that you ll be pretty well able to walk away and stay gone i got back on recently to adjust something in the dojo that only i could alter and immediately uninstalled it again even with a clan that s still at least somewhat active even with new content there s nothing left
