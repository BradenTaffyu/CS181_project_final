2022 fun fact whenever your connected to the internet and playing this game you ip address is being globally broadcast through the rockstar launcher this means other players with mod menus can set alerts to notify them whenever you go online they can then force their way into your lobby even if private and troll you until they get bored rockstar is aware of this issue but for some reason wont address it do not play online without a vpn even if you can get past all that the state of pc online is so distraught that it makes the game unplayable there are modders in every public lobby so your either constantly getting spawn killed and cant get anything done or the lobby will be so glitchy that it will eventually crash and kick you or force close the game the only way this game is tolerable is in a private lobby doing this will cut out most in game content though as most content is only available for play if your in a public lobby playing in a private lobby in my opinion also defeats the purpose of playing an online game unless you are only playing with a set group and you are all only on at the same time i have close to 500 hrs in game if this helps for reference on my experience
