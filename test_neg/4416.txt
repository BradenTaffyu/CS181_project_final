2016 the devs have become so interested in profits that within the past month they have made a mechanic riven mods and forced people to pay for the mechanic in terms of additional slots for the mechanic at almost 5 for 3 made a weapon with research costs so high that the only option for 99 of the players is to buy the weapon with currency bought with real money not to mention all of the other cash schemes such as their prime vault packages paying 60 for something that they voluntarily made scarce by removing all options to get the item until the items are available again after two years and even then only available for 1 month no thanks it was supposed to be a temporary solution and yet they implemented it permanently also they have put their game under beta for years now so that they continue to see how far they can screw over the playerbase i wouldn t recommend this game not even if they decided to give me a million plat currency bought with money mark my words the developers will only be continuing to pull greedy underhanded schemes
