2022 the game is extremely fun to play and worth the 20 but there are a few catches they have failed to really grow the player base and it s been stagnant and dropping in numbers for a while now it might be a worthwhile game for you if your available hours mesh with the spike in players on your specific region but otherwise your queue times might be a little long with that in mind you re really only allowed to play ranked matches where there are enough bots injected into your game at any and all ranks to inflate your performance as long as you don t die off spawn with this in mind the average player who wants a fast queue time will be resorted to play the ranked mode over the several other available modes because of queue times ranging from a full bot lobby instant popping to a 15 minute queue that finally popped because those other people just finished their game that will only take effect at a higher rank but there is nothing preventing the system from injecting someone of a high rank into your ranked match even when you re a brand new player the match will be deemed extremely difficult and you ll get extremely high rating for the match dependent on kills and placement personally despite my opinions on the game i wish they were to make this free to play as it s a really fun game to play and there is no arguing that i ve invested close to 400 hours between my two accounts and i ve tried to get many people into the game but many failed due to the strict learning curve associated with this game this is how it will go 1 you make your account and queue up for a quick match to play against a non ranked environment 2 your queue insta pops and you feel great about it 3 there are probably 2 other players in your game and it s your two other teammates in your trio 4 you will run around and fight some ai who sometimes run into walls have incredible parry reaction speed sometimes and sometimes it s just not there at all there is no middle ground 5 you will likely win your first 1 3 and they will be fast queues because of the amount of real players in the game is low 6 dependent on your performance in your other matches your queue time might increase as more and more players get injected into your game you will progressively see 1 or 2 real parties then maybe 3 6 then maybe more this will progressively go up and up as you get going into your levels but within the past several months playing both ranked in platinum where the queue times hit 10 minutes reguarly i have yet to see a full game of real players i never see more than 3 9 different names in the kill feed throughout the entire game and it feels like a vacant game now on the other hand if you had a friend to play and you were local to each other where the ping variance wasn t too severe i give this a 10 10 for customs the most playtime i get in this game nowadays is a custom lobby where several of my friends perform koth
