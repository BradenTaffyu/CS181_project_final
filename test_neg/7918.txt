product received for free i got this game as a gift from my dad after i let him know it was on sale after the implementation of safer seas the gameplay is great fun because unlike most pirate themed games you play as someone on a ship not the ship itself and safer seas has been a fun opportunity for me to play a game with my dad however i m giving this game a negative review for one simple reason rare it took over five years for them to implement safer seas despite demand for some kind of pve mode in the steam forums and elsewhere their mods have lashed out at people who criticize the game or request expansion of safer seas to be much less punitive towards people who don t enjoy pvp and now they ve delivered an ultimatum in the steam discussions threatening to shut them down altogether because they think their mods are the ones being abused the game itself is fun at least in safer seas so i recommend buying it when it s heavily on sale let rare know how much money they re missing out on rare you are terrible at public relations and you will suffer for it i will continue to play and enjoy what s available in safer seas and i will never spend a real world dollar on any of the micro transactions in the emporium as long as you continue to lash out against criticism and suggestions and unlike you i will gladly accept comments and criticism of this review constructive or otherwise edit that ultimatum thread i mentioned has been deleted and rare has pinned two posts advising people to go to other forums to give feedback saying that the devs rarely view the ones on steam apparently they didn t know how to counter the overwhelming outcry against their ultimatum including a couple posts that pointed out steam s own best practice guidelines which pointedly discourage their habit of arguing with players and locking threads so not only does rare suck at public relations but they are also cowards wonderful edit 2 rare has taken to deleting threads from the steam discussions without warning and without announcement in fact i was just banned for posting threads in which i endeavored to not mention them specifically and didn t use any language that violates steam community rules or guidelines so i take back what i said do not buy this game do not encourage others to buy it and if you already have it never spend any money in the emporium edit 3 for some reason i am no longer able to post comments on this review and steam support s initial response has not been helpful so apparently being banned from a game s community means i m not able to comment on my own review but since i m still receiving comments the review is clearly still visible a and because i m still able to edit this review i m going to respond to comments here for the time being comments christian3476 skill issue that s as asinine as saying a teetotaler s refusal to take part in a drinking contest is a liver issue ethan complains about pvp in a pirate game called sea of thieves wild where in the review did i complain about pvp and as for the implication that pvp is intrinsic to pirate themed games consider the following games that all came out before sea of thieves sid meier s pirates assassin s creed iv black flag risen 2 the monkey island series balenciaga high seas aren t even that dangerous lol you can spend days soloing without seeing another player sometimes cool but moot i don t enjoy massive multiplayer and any encounter with someone i don t know is one too many especially if they re as toxic as the players of this game tend to be chukyuniqul i will never understand this mentality of oh i wanna like this game but it s not for me therefore it s the game s fault it s like complaining that someone s hot but has an ass personality except their personality isn t even that bad they just don t with what you with i don t understand that mentality either good thing it s not my mentality to expand on your simile it s more like i want to go out with someone but their parents are the worst kind of bigots and always have their bigot friends over so the only way i can communicate with the one i m attracted to without having to be around the bigots is over the phone mate the game s not for you you have a right to counter recommend to other pve focused players but you re being whingy when you re tryina make it out like rare somehow owes you to make it into the game you like it s pure bratty entitlement i really wanna like hunt but it s too high a skill and knowledge floor for me the pvp focus is too great so i explained in my brief and negative review why without making crytek look like they re somehow failing at their job way to miss the point i m not saying rare owes me anything only that they are shooting themselves in the foot by alienating and even punishing a huge potential revenue source by not making some fairly simple changes to gameplay options especially given that they ve already added safer seas opportunity cost look it up lastly if you have all those pve focused pirate games why not go play those and leave the blend of pvp and pve that this one has to the people who actually like it way to miss the forest for the trees i listed those pirate games to point out that pirate themed games are not inherently about pvp sea of thieves has very different gameplay mechanics than most other pirate games and has a lot of appeal to it outside of its player base and developer mentality
