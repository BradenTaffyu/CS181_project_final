2023 i have been playing every tw warhammer on release 1 was fun for what it was 2 ended up amazing and we were promised that warhammer 3 would be the culmination of everything and the best in the franchise unfortunately corporate greed stood in the way of this promise while the game is barely batter than warhammer 2 bugs that were fixed in the previous game resurfaced in 3 many bugs that were hugely problematic in the previous game gate bug have not been adressed at all and now they re pushing out overpriced dlc which doesn t come with additional free content we ve come to know and love from wh 2 all in all ca is just run by shareholders and executives who care more about quick profits instead of keeping the loyal fanbase they ve cultivated since warhammer 1 shame on you ca
