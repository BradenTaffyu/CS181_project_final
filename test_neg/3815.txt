2017 i used to enjoy this game i played it alot on ps3 i was always excited for dlc like the ballad of gay tony and such but it never came then they ended up adding shark cards i thought nothing of it but then i looked how much these shark cards cost and how little money they give you the only good thing that ever happened to me in this game was a hacker giving me money so i could atleast experience the online portion until even it was taken away from me they ended up re releasing the game on ps4 and then finally ended up putting it on pc too which is where i got it but still they only show love for online they ve lost what it means to play grand theft auto and instead are just a cash grab now i m told they re getting rid of mods how much more are they going to take away from people trying to make this game fun
