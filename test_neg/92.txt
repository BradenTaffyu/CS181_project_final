yeah nah souls mechanics of this game can off which is practically 90 of it the only thing that is not a souls is that you do not lose any points exp money for dying nor do you need to go back and pick up your stuff everything else about this game is a souls people who are comparing this game to god of war are delusional the game in general is great but i wouldn t recommend it for the casual gamer due to it being an actual souls game and not a souls like i have finished the game twice second was on a new game plus and that is much easier than the initial play through but it is still a thumbs down from me due to how the souls combat is with the enemies tracking aimbot and what not
