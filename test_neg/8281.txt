2020 when you start playing most of your deaths will be because you aren t skilled enough at the game s mechanics don t have a hang of the wand editing don t know all the physics interactions available etc etc after more time playing and you do know the mechanics when you won t be surprised by new enemies or combinations any more every death will be out of your control pick one of the many different ways the game has for instantly randomly and unavoidably ending a run get stuck on random invisible pixels while enemies hit you this is a bad enough issue that the devs had to add a feature to unstick the player by removing pixels nearby after you mash the controls for long enough without moving long enough to be killed before you actually get unstuck usually get shot with a wand from off screen or through a wall by an enemy you haven t seen yet get killed randomly in the safe area because a worm dug through it or because an enemy randomly teleported in and shot you while you had the menu open get insta killed because an electric enemy you haven t seen touched the ground off screen or behind a wall get suddenly doused in and insta killed by acid polymorphine or lava because the game teleports liquids upwards through ceilings floors including upwards through the floor of the safe area ie you can randomly get doused in liquids while standing inside the safe area doing inventory management the game also leans extremely hard into a lot of dumb git gud isms in its game design whose sense of accomplishment is almost entirely undercut by the fact that even after you git gud all you are rewarded with is the bs listed above i have beaten the game many times and done a decent chunk of the secret content once you understand the spell combos and physics mechanics it is actually quite easy usually there will be a wand in the last area or two which can basically 1 shot every enemy in the game including the final boss as long as you don t get randomly zapped from off screen on the way there or get one of the few extremely overpowered perks again a lottery i never felt any sense of accomplishment from this game even after my first win i knew it was mostly a result of the rng dropping good wands and not dropping any insta deaths in my path i played because i am a fan of traditional roguelikes and was a fan of the many powder games on the web back in the day and the basic physics and spell combination are still cool it is fun to blow up the little enemies and then kick their dumb little bodies around the game would be a lot more fun if it actually let you do this stuff in a way that it didn t punish you for it is a real shame that such a unique premise for a game had to be developed with such a terrible sense of game balance and such brazen disrespect for its players i regret spending the time i did with this game if you think the premise sounds cool my recommendation is wait and hope the devs open source it or modders can make some kind of total rework mod to fix its worst aspects because playing it in its current state will only poison your opinion of it until then edit played a bit more after the 1 0 and epilogue updates all the problems i mentioned still exist along with several new ones i guess my 1 0 review is amazing premise decent technical execution extremely poor game design
