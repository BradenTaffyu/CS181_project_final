2021 used to be an enjoyable movement based battle royale engaging fights and a good way to pass some time with friends now it s just an utter sweatfest almost every medium of fun factor has been either ruined or just completely removed from the game how so many movement techniques have been altered as to limit or altogether prevent players from performing them character s movement abilities have been significantly nerfed or changed in a way that grounds the game as an almost generic first person shooter not a movement based one the characters and their abilities that hinder movement are getting buffed i understand that character balance is one thing but the very thing that set the game apart from the others was undone by its own developers this isn t to say there isn t any form of movement whatsoever no no there are still many ways of high skill play based around movement simply it s hard not to notice the game transitioning further and further away from its roots when compared to the engaging combat and pure enjoyment found in titanfall 2 s movement system apex is found lacking as of now it barely holds a torch that being said the gameplay is still some of the best out there that you ll find in the battle royale genre characters are unique and guns feel good to fire though it is becoming increasingly harder and harder to enjoy with the so called skilled based match making now as i m not someone who coded the algorithm for it i obviously don t know exactly how it functions or if it is working properly but i can attest that it is simply not functioning in a way that is beneficial for the majority of players and the game i m a casual player i hop on the game to play some chill matches and have a break of sorts that s nearly impossible now with the way it groups teams from my experience i believe the sbmm matchmakes you based off of your most recent match if you won or just generally did good got a few more kills than normal you will be in the sweatiest of sweaty lobbies when you get instantly killed on drop by that sweaty 20k kill ttv wraith you will still be in sweaty lobbies for your next match you will have to play around 10 or so games to get into a comfortable lobby more so around your skill level that seems good right not having your elo tank simply because of an off match the problem is that your elo will skyrocket upon a win so the algorithm will take its time keeping you in sweaty lobbies upon a loss and instantly assume you re playing this game for a living and queue you accordingly for every decent match you have the flaw lies in the fact that the game is always trying to give you the toughest match it can even in casual pubs mode the shortcomings of the so called sbmm are highlighted even more when you play with friends either of a higher or lower skill bracket than you instead of being able to play some music and get the occasional few kills you re expected to sweat your pits off trying to kill a squad before you get wiped by the 3rd party team who can hear your shots from across the map and will arrive in 20 seconds a game should do its best to bring enjoyment for the players not prevent them from doing the very thing the apex is marketed on fighting and combat because the players are afraid to engage another team due to the fear of the 3rd party team arriving to janitor both squads there can be enjoyment and fun in competition and trying your hardest that is why there is a ranked mode but the sweat should stay in ranked it shouldn t be forced to spill into casuals due to poor development choices i consider myself an above average player i ve got somewhere around a 1 5 k d ratio which is nothing impressive but it means i m good enough to typically kill more than one person per match it does not mean i can compete with triple stacked predator teams with all the fancy badges that preds have and skill based matchmaking should not force me to do so players should be grouped with others according to their overall performance this current season not on a whim based on their most recent match matchmaking should take the average of how the player is performing over a broad set amount of matches and match them with players of similar stats this way the player is allowed to see themselves improve and enjoy that instead of being punished for doing well moving on the servers are absolute trash for this game play a few matches and you ll see for yourself hackers are rampant micro transactions are limited to cosmetics only lootboxes etc which is good however the prices are unacceptable ea respawn are charging 20 25 for most limited event skins yeah it s a free to play game and they need to monetize it somehow i get it but 20 for a single skin on a single character is borderline robbery to put this into perspective you can get an entire aaa game title for the same price on steam sales you can get a brand new whole other aaa game upon release for the equivalent of three what are essentially recolors of a character in this game that s a bit ridiculous if you ask me i know i on this game quite a bit during this review i actually do have some rather fond memories of it and it still is fun to play sometimes i simply cannot recommend it because the enjoyment it brings is not worth the salt and other disgruntled feelings that come along with it it will leave a bad taste in your mouth
