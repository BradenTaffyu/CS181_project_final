the game is completely dead for me the developer is doing everything to make pc players leave the game or switch to gamepads aimassist is too strong they don t think about the fact that there should be a balance between the pc skill and the gamepad skill on gamepads players do not think about tracking during enemy strafes the aimassist does everything for the gamepad while pc players need to put in more effort to defeat gamepad players who have been given a legal cheat even in the first warzone the aimassist was not so strong game developer if you are reading this review then you should learn balance from the game the finals everything is fine there with balance
