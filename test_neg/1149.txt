2022 i would give a mixed review if i could elden ring has a lot of issues that could be a deal breaker depending on your preferences i ll list the positives first and then the negatives positives the story is quite good if you re willing to put in the effort to read all item descriptions and carefully listen to all npcs the world itself looks fine depending on how good your pc is the unique bosses are mostly fun to fight and the combat is as it always is in a souls game there s a variety of weapons and spells to use which gives a lot of choice in playstyle negatives the largest issue with elden ring is also its main advertised feature the open world the open world is too large and there is too little to do there there are so many open fields with just 3 4 crafting materials in it and nothing else that is worthwhile it feels incredibly empty furthermore there are way too many copypasted structures in the open world every church every shack every ruin is the exact same the bosses in the open world are usually copypasted and you ll encounter the same bosses in multiple areas sometimes even a unique major boss is repeated in an area where it makes little sense the open world also causes many issues with npc questlines which are harder to keep track of than ever and the use of a wiki is pretty much required to follow them while the world does have a lot of dungeons and caves to find these have many of their own issues anyone familiar with the chalice dungeons in bloodborne will immediately recognize that the dungeons in elden ring are much the same they are all copypasted and just not worth the time there are around 4 5 unique dungeons which you ll then see repeated literally everywhere it s so boring going through the same dungeons over and over again the same enemies can be found in all dungeons as well mines will have the same miner enemies catacombs have either skeletons or gargoyles there s no variety at all the boss at the end of the dungeons is copypasted and the same bosses can be found in different dungeons just with health differences the reward at the end is not worth the time in most cases either this leads me to my next point which is that the performance of this game is really bad if you have an older cpu be prepared to run into a ton of issues that are caused by the game not using the threads of the cpu properly invisible enemies the world not loading correctly bosses not appearing these are all things that can happen because the optimization of the game is so bad the online connectivity of elden ring is also incredibly poor i played dark souls 3 on release and never experienced any of the problems that elden ring currently has playing co op with more than one person will result in one of the summons randomly disconnecting very frequently playing co op with one person is more manageable but there will still be random connection errors even during boss fights the connection problems also affect invasions with invaders randomly encountering connection errors the last thing i want to mention are the current balance issues with sorceries require intelligence and incantations require faith many powerful sorceries can be found from the very start of the game making an intelligence build the easiest way to play from the early game onwards sorceries can easily deal twice as much damage as incantations good incantations can be found only in the late mid game to end game and even then they still aren t as good as sorceries the early to mid game has around 5 6 sorcery focused areas while incantations have absolutely nothing until the late mid game these balance problems could be solved down the road but currently it really sucks that one build is clearly inherently better and easier than other builds conclusion if you don t care about copypasted structures enemies and bosses then you might still enjoy elden ring you should also forget about long co op sessions or consistent invasions however for me these aspects ruin some of my enjoyment of the game and make me hesitant to recommend it
