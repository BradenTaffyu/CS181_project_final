even after massive community backlash the paints are still consumable and have to be bought per skin piece helmet and body separatley not even per descendant nor per account they conviniently only removed the gatcha part so if you want to use one color for both body and helmet that s already 2 paints that you have to buy for premium but if you change your skin to a different one ohh you have to buy new paints and this is just one color you want back and white maybe with a golden accent that s 3 different colors plus helmet and body so you already need to buy 6 for premium currency which is 2 5 eur just for 3 colors on one helemt and body and you would expect that you could color the 20 eur skins in the game for free at least oh no you also have to pay to color those too edit ohh and you don t have a ps too bad you are already missing out on cosmetics
