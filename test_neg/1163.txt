2022 just to lay down my bonafides since every negative review here is instantly spammed with git gud or some cringe 2011 type beat i ve 100 ed every dark souls game i ve done speedruns challenge runs the whole lot when i call things in elden ring hard it is not for lack of experience elden ring has a lot of minor flaws sparse armor early game some jank w teleporting field bosses boring crafting boring catacombs the hundreds of spirits and flowers i will never use but i can basically forgive all of those because the game at the start is honestly incredible however about halfway through the development budget totally falls out and every area is now a ten mile corridor full of enemies that can 2 shot you alone the placement feels almost random at times and it gets tilting fast there is an entire lategame subcontinent with three graces that means if you die to any of the 2 shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes you have to cross the entire thing again the two areas after that are nearly as bad to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option once again i can totally forgive some bad levels every game has some but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth trying to beat every shardbearer major boss you ll find at least two that are literally unplayable one early game that is easily cheesable starscourge radahn and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable malenia blade of miquella the latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable with a half second tell that only helps if you re 30 feet away and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second after all the shardbearers you get the semifinal boss a damage sponge who can 1 or 2 shot with every attack who has an entire phase where every attack is a room filling aoe and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12 attack combos if you can beat the aoe grab machine you get the honor of fighting the final boss which has a fun if unfairish first phase followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of cool final boss which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had any plan for this endgame like we had a cool final boss in phase one with radagon but they got swapped for the idea of the elden ring like a ridiculous soul of cinder parody once the comical humiliating damage sponge is taken care of you get your pick of ending there are effectively two with one obviously bad third choice where you literally burn the entire world because why not and overall we leave with very little idea what any of this was about what our ending choice even means for the world or what we ve really done in the first place yay game done after 90 hours i feel totally numb and ambivalent to this there are a lot more things to talk about like how finnicky quests become with an open world but i think the worst thing i can say is that i spent all of elden ring planning new runs and build ideas and now that i ve beaten it i just feel tired and let down but the ost does 100 slap and i do love torrent as well as a lot of the npcs 100 a for them you can hug a woman which is more than i can say about my love life edit there is actually precisely one thing from the comments i d like to add to this review if you see anyone saying elden ring has six endings let me break them down for you there is the basic ending there is the true ish ending there is a bad ending then there are three more endings these are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed nothing new is added and they amount to become god become god but bad grey become god but very bad red and become god but catholic these feel like extremely late additions and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non apocalyptic endings really is they re meaningless enough that elden ring basically only has three endings also i only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer the dude from all the trailers just shows up in the field with a different name and you fight him again elden ring s copypasting problem is seriously everpresent and i ve not touched on it as much as it deserves especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game it s fun for one run but by the second playthrough i d really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game
