modders ruin the game in 2024 i put tons of my own money into shark cards and lots of hours playing to level up to about level 100 just to get in a modded lobby that gave me 400 levels i thought oh well right the game is 10 years old who really cares but no i got screwed over by rockstar banning and completley clearing my account from existance never did i get modded money myself or levels intentionally its complete im actually so mad i even put a dime into this money sucking game ill never play gta online in my lietime again they done this to me twice now and i hate rockstar i even bought red dead 2 for 60 and thought what a terrible game and waste of money just let people enjoy the old turd game no wonder everyone just plays rp or five m gta online sucks badly i prolly wont buy gta6 either cuz why does it take 10 years to make a game
