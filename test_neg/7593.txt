2020 sea of thieves is overwhelmed with pvp at the moment if you re planning on buying the game to enjoy its pve content you ll soon realize many players have played the game for so long they are only looking for pvp at this point and they will lead you into a fight no matter what your intent is they can t take no for an answer so you will be insulted countless times just because you re here when they are they will be very creative at making your experience terrible for their own enjoyment it s pretty rare that they ll just take your loot if any then leave without pushing it further for 15 minutes most likely they ll sink your ship and kill you repeatedly even though it serves no purpose besides wasting your time the community is toxic beyond belief and their debate over private servers is yet another proof the game itself is very immersive with gorgeous graphics and ambiences awesome characters ships design and most of the pve content is enjoyable even in solo it s not too casual yet not too hard though you ll definitely need a good team to unlock what this game has to offer menus are confusing at first but you get used to them pretty quickly to be honest i d be 100 recommending this game if the players base was not so despicable i ve not met anyone friendly in 40 hours of gameplay and i truly mean not once despite what some people might say i don t mind pvp every now and then but i despise toxic communities and this one is the worst i ve seen by far over nearly 25 years of gaming i cannot recommend this game to new players mixing pvp and pve together isn t a terrible idea but right now people are playing this game as if it was just another team based competitive fps and you can t really enjoy pve with that many bullies and trolls around i ve given this game a chance twice and i still enjoy its content and gameplay very much yet i uninstalled it again and i m considering asking for a refund because toxic players can t even understand when they re going too far i feel like people are asking for private servers mostly to avoid toxic players at this point not just for roleplay with rewards disabled and i cannot blame them for asking that much this shouldn t happen what a shame for such an amazing game edit anyone complaining about toxic pvp players in their review are receiving tons of judgemental comments which again proves how toxic this community is just browse through negative reviews sometimes even positive ones and see for yourself besides trolls and fake reviews this topic is present in almost every single review the same guys that are bullying players in the game are finding cheap excuses for their toxic behavior in the comments around here no good will ever come from such community until pvp is somehow restricted and toxic players are effectively removed i don t believe this is happening anytime soon i ve watched pro players streaming sot ever since release and even though they re nearly unbeatable at the game they re still annoyed by all these toxic behaviors no online game should ever come to this
