2020 dead by daylight is about to approach its 4th anniversary which is quite impressive you would think that after 4 years the game would have improved a lot and in some ways it did but in other ways it has not the devs seem far more interested in pushing out new cosmetics and dlcs instead of fixing this buggy mess of a game or improving the new player experience it s frankly ridiculous to see the amount of issues the game still has to this date with the devs progressing at a snails pace bugsthis game is super buggy some bugs have existed for years if not months and some of them straight up makes it impossible to play the game some prevents you from ranking up some makes you dc at the match loading screen some just makes it super annoying to play with friends and these bugs have existed for at least over a year but that s not the worst part of it with each update there is a good chance a major obvious bug somehow slips through and you just have to wonder if these devs even bother playtesting their own damn game at times it s ridiculous how many noteworthy bugs gets introduced with each patch and it s ridiculous how many of them remain unsolved even months after release friend of mine can t even play the game because he has been plagued by several bugs for months now and whenever he seems to find a fix for one bug another somehow pops up completely unrelated to the first one this is inexcuseable and i have to question what sort of spaghetti code this game runs on at this point balancethe balance of the game has improved drastically since the beginning there are lots of blatantly unfair things that has been nerfed or reworked and it s pretty good but the devs are super slow when it comes to balancing in general freddy was left as one of the killers for like 2 years before getting a rework clown has been garbage against any remotely competent survivors since his release 2 years ago you want to win against good survivors you better learn nurse freddy billy or spirit most other killers can do decent against survivors but many of them still rely on the survivors making mistakes rather than you outplaying them several perks are also straight up useless leading to a super stale meta where both killers and survivors will be using the same perks for the most part with a few variations and new killers and survivors release with terrible perks all the time too most killers and survivors released in the last couple of years had like 1 ok to great perk 2 niche to garbage perks some of which are literally just straight up inferior or sometimes superior versions of already existing perks the devs are clearly running out of ideas when it comes to perks and it s showing in the latest designs at least the latest released killers have been pretty good matchmaking and rankingthe matchmaking in this game is an absolute joke i have never seen a more unbalanced matchmaking system in any other mp game i have played purple rank killers can get completely new players in their games new killers can face 4 red rank survivors green rank killers can get a mix of grey and red survivors now you might be wondering what these colors mean the ranking system is divided into 5 colors grey yellow green purple and red rank going from the lowest rank to the highest rank but for whatever reason people of all kinds of ranks can just be thrown into a match together even if they aren t premade there are way too many rainbow matches in this game and it makes for a frustrating experience both for the experienced players but also the new players additionally the rank system in this game is an absolute joke the amount of god awful survivors i have seen in purple red rank is shocking many of them lack understanding of even the most basic game mechanics but they somehow climb the rank because it s super easy to rank up as survivor this leads to a mix of good and mediocre survivors in what should be the highest level of play in this game on the other hand killers has a hard time ranking up not because they re unskilled but because ranking up in the high rank is too dependant on the skill of the survivors if you as the killer stomp the survivors and kill all of them in 3 minutes too bad you get a de pip basically a loss because how dare you actually be good at this game or how dare you punish survivors playing poorly the same goes for survivors if the killer is bad they might not be able to pip at red ranks either the devs has done nothing to address this besides minor changes that should ve been in there from the beginning the matchmaking and rank system is a meme in this community at this point the grindthe game is not remotely new player friendly not just because of the terrible excuse for a matchmaking but also because of the grind unlocking all the good perks for all characters require a lot of grinding all characters got 3 perks unique to them which can be made available for all other characters by getting the teachable versions showing up at 30 35 and 40 respectively for them once the teachable is unlocked those perks has a chance of showing up in other characters blood webs it s entirely rng if you ll get some of the few good perks or all the garbage perks this game is full of unlocking all the good perks on just one characters takes a lot of playtime you may very well be looking at 30 50hrs of grinding just to unlock all good perks on one character depending on your luck getting bloodpoints the currency for unlocking perks and add ons is extremely slow unless a double bp event is going on but those events are very rare if you don t use any of the perks that increase bp gain we re gonna live forever for survivor barbeque chilli for killer it s a pain and even with those perks it s still a ridiculous grind to unlock all good perks on just one killer forget about playing any other game if you want all the good perks in this game you better be prepared to spend weeks dedicated to this game and nothing else the devs are barely doing anything to help with this they stubbornly refuse to increase the bp gain they stubbornly refuse to just make the double bp event gain the norm they stubbornly refuse to do anything that ll actually help deal with this terrible grind all the while giving idiotic excuses like think about the bloodpoint economy you can earn some killers for free but you also have to grind a lot for them communitythe community just plain and simply suck people get offended over the most mundane things and people are toxic for no good reason you dare loop a killer some will facecamp you you dare down a survivor some of the survivors will dc on you you dare flashlight save a teammate some killers will tunnel you no joke there is a bunch of unwritten rule for this game according to a decent amount of people on both sides and it kills any fun you can have the devs also don t care about how terrible this community is the report system is a joke and people who sandbag even their own teammates rarely if ever gets punished as of late there has also been an increase of hackers in this game some youtubers already got videos regarding them and there is nothing suggesting bhvr is gonna deal with it any time soon just like every other damn issue in this game it s frankly a miracle that this game still does so well despite all these issues i have given bhvr the benefit of doubt many times before but their sheer incompetence and stubborness to make good changes is mindblowing this is not a game i would ever recommend to anyone you would be much better off playing any other mp games with friends odds are they might have devs who are way more competent and actually test their damn patches and balance things at a reasonable pace instead of once in a blue moon
