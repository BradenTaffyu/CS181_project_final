2021 if you re not going to lower the base price then how about making a call of duty black ops iii just zombies and nothing else because nothing else matters edition i mean you are scamming people by making them think that the multiplayer is enjoyable after all you re also fully admitting that you re aware of the fact that a large majority of your players the ones that aren t cheaters only play for the zombies and custom maps solely by calling the base game zombies chronicles edition you obviously just want people to buy the full package for a higher price and that would be fine if it wasn t for the fact that it feels like it never really goes on sale and the game is what 6 years old now can t forget that the sale prices for these games are always the same every single time as well can only recommend buying it when it s on sale can only recommend buying call of duty black ops iii zombies when it s on sale edit just finished the campaign and i already forgot what happened
