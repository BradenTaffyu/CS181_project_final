i mainly play on the steam deck with my wife on the computer so thank you for introducing this absolutely useless update that will solve nothing whatsoever at the expense of locking a number of players out of the game modders have already figured out how to bypass the anti cheat so give yourselves a pat on the back for creating more problems instead of just having proper dedicated servers may i also add that battleye is actually supported on linux and rockstar just simply chooses not to enable it
