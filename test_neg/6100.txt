2019 i cannot recommend this game i want to like it hell i ve got almost 100 hours in i did enjoy it but i just can t any more the community is highly toxic expect someone to do something rude or toxic in every match how is this possible you ask the game employs a ranking system the bottom rank is rank 20 new player the top rank is 1 makes sense right a game with a ranking system then should be expected to have players of similar skill levels and abilities playing against each other good players play against other good players experienced players should be higher ranks except it s incredibly easy to circumvent the system it s a known problem of high ranking players de ranking on purpose to troll or abuse newer players it s even easier to just group up with your high ranking friend and play against players who are similar in rank to the lowest rank person not the highest rank this would be like having an nfl team recruiting a high school kid and then playing against high schools because the least experienced person on their team is in high school overall i want to recommend the game i do i really enjoyed it but after all the chat abuse stupid tea bagging and other behaviors in game meant to belittle you and people who shouldn t be playing against new players i m done i m not playing anymore and i regret spending money on this game if you like to be made to feel stupid and helpless by people who are far superior to you in ability and game knowledge play dead by daylight if you prefer to actually enjoy a competitive game i suggest you look elsewhere
