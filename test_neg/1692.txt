steam should create an award for the game devs that hate their customers the most then ca would have a title that wins at least one award every year but just so this is somewhat of an actual review the game is fun it s three games that have been built up on each other with apparently little long term planning so its mechanics can be convoluted and poorly adapted to later additions look up wulfhart in ie but despite that the years have allowed for many interesting changes and improvements to various faction mechanics i have a ton of fun with this game most of the time because its scale variety and fantastic mod community make up for a lot of its shortcomings with that being said ca hates its fans or rather they seem utterly indifferent to the needs of its customers once they ve been parted from their money they ll acknowledge a persistent and somewhat significant glitch say they re working on it then not mention it for 3 months while spitting out another dlc instead of fixing it luckily someone discovered that you fan fix it by buying the blood god dlc because why not spend money on something you don t want to have a product work as advertised there s the fact that new dlc factions have smaller and smaller rosters while the dlc prices keep going up there s the whole the right to discuss is a privilege thing and today they removed version 4 1 4 the most recent version compatible with most mods from the steam rollback options so you have to play vanilla with their most recent patch which was so well made at launch that it needed two hotfixes in 3 weeks and probably needs more so while the game is a lot of fun i don t recommend it unless you1 want to be furious every 2 6 weeks because ca is doing their thing again and2 want to play a game with an entertainment value that is dependent on how many hundreds of dollars you d like to spend getting past the dlc paywallsbut if those things don t bother you you ll probably really enjoy it
