2023 after the success of wh2 this game was destined for greatness yet even now one and a half year after its release it is still broken and it s getting worse immortal empires still lack narrative content compared to mortal empires from wh2 intros quests and its beta tag was shamelessly removed while major issues still stand ai sieges garrisons etc update cycle is awfully slow and the patches often bring new bugs that are left unfixed for months including simple 5 minute fixes when patch notes boast a new fix or feature and it doesn t work at all damsel troths then something is really wrong they either didn t test it released wrong data or knew it was broken but released it anyway all options suggest incompetent management moreover it took them an absurd amount of time to release a mere roadmap their communication with the community is woefully insufficient simple tweaks wished by the players take years to implement and now they announced a new dlc with an inflated price to put it mildly and how did they address the inevitable player backlash they added insult to injury by an implied threat to abandon the game if we don t buy their well done ca that s going in the book of grudges i m getting the impression that there is just a skeleton crew of like 10 20 devs working on the game who i believe would like to put things right but their greedy management doesn t give them enough space i spent thousands of hours in total war games and i spent hundreds in this game looking forward for it to get polished and expanded to reach its full potential but with this kind of shoddy work and attitude towards fans they made me write this review and i ll think twice before buying anything else from this company edit after seeing the content reveal of the upcoming dlc i don t know if i should laugh or cry the huge price controversy aside the design itself is just dumb the jade dragon ruler of the central provinces the guy who pretty much runs the cathay starts away in lustria the pseudo baba yaga protector of kislev land forests etc starts in bloody nagaroth on the other side of the world who designs this nonsense this urge to mix everything up just for the sake of gameplay diversity regardless of lore and common sense is absurd ca get your together
