2023 a great game ruined by the toxicity to be clear i m not against pvp but what goes on in sot on a regular basis is no longer pvp goes into the realms of harassment and abuse this is coming from a guy playing cod back in those days difference between now and then is back then we were all sort of in on it now it s kinda just forced on you getting chased all over the seas by some dude and his for friends racial slur named ship don t even have loot or anything worth their time and they just attack me because i exist players admitting they go out of their way to hunt people new to sot i was on the receiving end of it more than once safer seas is a half baked attempt to apease a tired community who doesn t mind pvp but is just tired of being harassed i ll change my review when i see rare putting effort in to care for their community
