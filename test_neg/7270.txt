the actual game oh i love it everything else i hate it cash shop purchases on a 70 game capcom is retarded with this nonsense i ve got a 4070 ti and a 11k series i7 my game is pixalated sometimes what the update looks like the item to remake your character is at the pawn shop lol in gran soren kind of wack that it s that deep into the game which isn t deep at all if you re rushing story i was exploring and you can get the currency from just playing the game and having a good pawn additionally looks like the denuvo anti piracy nonsense they ve got going on can brick your account if you try and delete your save in an attempt to start over again so i don t recommend doing that speaking of there s no new game function and that irks me and i like trying stuff again and again and don t mind going through the beginning of the game to test different stuff out they plan on adding it though still not a recommend for me well i mean yes it is i like the game and enjoy it a lot but i still don t want to see this on the next monster hunter because you know those greedy will do this there too
