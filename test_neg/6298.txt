2022 i used to love dbd i really truly did from 2016 until now when unemployed from covid for the entirety of 2020 and most of 2021 i played it almost exclusively with my gf and it was wonderful but mostly because of her this game used to be something special but bhvr has always done the absolute bare minimum and now they aren t even doing that the game is rampant with cheaters hackers that can ddos you you basically have to play the game through a vpn to be safe it s been a buggy barely functional mess for the entirety of the game s life and after 5 years that s just not excusable anymore the devs now actively block people that speak negatively of them for their actions and lack thereof and in the past they d deny the coveted fog whisperer status to people that supported and loved the game if they dared to speak negatively or criticize the game bhvr now they ve gotten so petty as to remove cosmetics from the account of a well known and liked streamer of this game all because he made a joke about them on twitter this game will never be worth playing again until bhvr straightens up and acts right and they won t because this game has no competition they found an exploitable niche concept that other games can t challenge because dbd s been building up a base of famous well known characters to play as and against i honestly wish i could get all the money back i ve spent on this game i regret having spent it even though i did so when i loved the game and tolerated the bs that bhvr is so good at if you want a recommendation on something good to play with good devs that actually give half a damn about their players and the functionality of the game check out project zomboid or barotrauma they re nothing like dbd and the indie stone undertow games are nothing like behavior that is honestly one of the highest compliments i can give to those two games and devs
