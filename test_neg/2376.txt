2023 product received for free edit this review was for season 17 the game has changed a lot since then and match making is much better for casual players today the time needed before being able to play ranked has been lowered and the console dominance is not as noticeable anymore stay away new player experience and it s by far the worst gaming experience i ve ever had the displeasure of living through barely this is a long one first warning this is not grindr the way it constantly invades your behind you could easily think it is but on grindr at least you have a chance of a kiss first if you are a new player looking for a new game stay away i repeat don t even think of touching the load of crap that this game is right now apex is not interested in new players stay away there are two major issues that completely ruins the new player experience in this game the first one with separate but no less horribly designed flaws that contribute to the larger issue 1 there is no new player pathway to get to know the game in a fun and easy way as a lvl 1 account you have access to 3 game modes which is a playlist of non battle royale maps such as zone control and then you have br duo or trio but not ranked to be able to join ranked your account needs to be lvl 50 which took me and my friend about 90 hours so just to be able to join a playlist where decent matchmaking is expected you need to play through a single player campaign worth of time so you re stuck with these 3 modes to grind for 90 hours and it is a horrifying grind the apex matchmaking has created its new category of completely useless in our first games we were constantly matched against people with 1000 s of kills and when our kda dropped close to absolute zero we instead only got people with 100 s of kills if you re unlucky enough that the game accidentally gives you a match where you happen to win then you re screwed you re back at practically every match having diamond players on the other teams will you get matches without diamonds sure but i can count those matches on one hand the times i ve wanted to send hate mails to the devs i ve lost count of but say you stay and try to hit that lvl 50 mark to get into ranked because there surely it ll get better right first you have 10 placement matches in my first i had 10 diamond trails which kinda makes sense you get tested against the best to place same thing the rest of the 10 games great i got placed in wood 2 below bronze that has to mean i ll get matched against other suckers like me right no my friend and i were rookie ii we had a bronze iii friend join cause ranked is only trios and here we go again diamond trails all over the place top players having 1000 s of kills bad first luck i ve played 5 more ranked games and it hasn t been any different it s like apex says they ve implemented a ranked system but forgot to add the actual code for placing you in a rank or adding a rank limit for any matches i can go on for ages about the abyssmal matchmaking apex doesn t have but i think i ve made my point clear 2 the second major issue is cross platform which is a great thing when you want it but as a pc player you can t turn that off consoles can pc can t and that shouldn t be too much of an issue right you have a mouse that moves way more precise than sticks only what apex did was to give controllers a gluestick of aim assist it doesn t matter if you have 100 more hours than the controller you re up against if you re in a 1v1 he will down you majority of the times because he can t miss when most of the streamers of a game switches to playing on console it s a very telling sign that you have an issue this has been voiced by the community but apex doesn t care 3 and that s the third category of issues with apex that aren t game breaking in the same way they don t care about you i had several technical issues in the beginning and i posted several threads on different forums including apex own technical forum on apex forum i never got a reply on the other threads the answers ranged from gitgud or yeah apex sucks you just have to deal with it the apex support team is nonexistent except if you post in an unsupported language and the apex player community is with a few exceptions just straight out toxic and it makes me sad because the game is fun the champs are unique with lots of fun ideas the weapons and items are good and allow you to form your own play style the maps are good and gives you great opportunities to utilize the unique play styles the champs have but these positives are nothing compared to the horrible matchmaking the unfair device configurations the heap of technical issues and the community sure it s free but in its current state you should get paid to play it i would ve had a better time counting grains of sand in a desert for 90hrs i can t stress enough how bad of an overall experience apex has been there aren t enough numbers below 0 for me to rate this game don t touch
