after almost 3 years and hundreds of hours i am reasy to write a review in short i do not recommend this game unless you enjoy being in the ass without lube now some details the game is absolutely beautiful graphics characters outfits architecture attention to details evrything is just stunning this is the main reason why i kept going back but now my butt isn t just hurting but anus is gushing blood that s why i am writing this review the game is not greedy and you can get a lot of cosmetics without paying there are a lot of rewards just for your time in the game and once you purchase the battle pass you can get all your gold back after completing it now it s time for some whining everything below is written from the point of view of an average solo player there is and there was no balance in the game not enough players to fill matches in order to have any semblance of equal rank when you are silver you play with bots when you are platinum you are matched against top players on the server should i explain how such matches go oh god my anus twitches violently just remembering those encounters with top 100 players when you are not even in 500 you will be stunlocked and comboed into oblivion if you are lucky you ll be able to land a hit new heroes are increasingly op with ridiculous ultimates that will rip your anus in shreds in seconds even if they rework abilities of some old heroes they give make them op you can t really learn tutorial exoplains the basics easy bots are morons and do not act as players hard bots will you in the ass as quickly and is roughly as any top player i think that s enough of a rant for today i feel a little bit better now it s time to apply some cooling balm on you guessed it
