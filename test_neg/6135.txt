2019 purchased jul 22 2016 7 40ampoints i have been a devoted player for well over 3 years have been following since before the release and have 586 hours as of writing this review if i decide to play more or if i revise the review andi want to articulate this review as best as i can being a veteran of dbd has had it s challenges seeing the changes balances new content hype generating releases on different consoles and the consumer response i ve attended the official discord watched many streamers and have streamed it myself when i say i get frustrated it goes well beyond that not talking keyboard or monitor breaking but just the unwillingness to play any game after a session of dbd it mentally drains me now i ve been happy with some things mad at others pros relatively fun gameplay once you get a hang of the mechanics and what to do the ranking system feels fair the points and how they re earned push me to be a more well rounded dbd player surviving with friends is fun kyf though i don t play it much is enjoyable as well a plethora of characters to choose from an even larger variety of perks to customize your character into any play style you can think of consistent patches and detailed descriptions of what has changed cons bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs the fact that the plethora of characters and cosmetics to choose from is over 100 usd in total dlc the feel that when things are going bad they release content to satiate the masses the feel that they pump out so much content in a short span of time to specifically generate interest and make sales instead of fixing glaring issues the community if you can even call it that has devolved into toxic camping tunneling t bagging sandbagging harassing jerkwads that take advantage of mechanics that while in other games are frowned upon and usually reportable are totally allowed in the reporting system of dbd correct me if i m wrong the devs taking input from large streamers and not smaller bits of the community the events are uneventful as another reviewer put themv finally dbd just gets stale it s the same game mode repeatedly events are nothing special and don t add much of anything double bp moonrise summer bbq it s all the same thing just with some nice d cor and one extra meaningless objective like grab a lantern on your way out or do this special generator in particular it s just boring and uninspired the community alone has been the set off for me to finally write a review after 3 years in the beginning the community in the game wasn t that bad the rise of jerks in the game however has scared off many players including me where i ve had to take weeks off just to feel a want to play again and even then it was small the gameplay can t even be enjoyed when killers and survivors alike belittle you post game after playing like a bunch of toxic a holes teammates will work with the killer draw attention to you on purpose to kill you off farm you for points afk or dc on you i get about a dc every 2 3 matches or so or just be a general pain in the ass killers will camp you for the entire 2 minutes you re on a hook and allow no opportunity for rescue hyper focus on one person at a time to kill them off or slug down people to the ground from the get go both ends of the game s spectrum face challenges and toxicity but the reporting system doesn t allow for it the amount of times i ve been told by members of the dbd community it s not a bannable reportable offense is ridiculous why isn t it why is this considered toxic and unjust in any other game you may happen to play but with dbd everyone just throws up their hands and says whatever are the devs doing anything to remedy the issue after 3 years i don t think so i don t want to give this game a bad review despite all of the game s issues i still enjoy playing it i enjoy introducing people to it teaching them having fun with friends or streamers the community however it s absolutely horrendous has only gotten worse with time and proceeds to get even more unbearable i preemptively sympathize to any person that buys or gets gifted the game faces the doodoo community and doesn t want to play anymore i think this is where i uninstall i d say it was a good run but it was okay at best i feel like the metacritic and gamespot reviews for the game say it for me but metacritic pc 71 100ps4 64 100xone 58 100gamespot pc 6 10 i d give it a hearty 6 10sorry to do you dirty after so long dbd but it s about that time
