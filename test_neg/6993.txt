2016 i had such high hopes for this game but with the obvious neglect of pc players who wants to pay 60 to a money hungry company like activision just opening the game you can see issues like frame stutters almost no online players and the fact it takes 10 minutes some times to join a server they also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys and i will be honest i have put almost 40 into crypto keys but i cant get over the fact that the servers are so bad less then 1 percent of players are on the dlc that i payed for really and me and my friends have had such crazy issues with the nat type and having a party for multiplayer if you are absoulutely set on buying this game do not buy the dlc honestly the worst money i have ever spent oh and one last thing prepare for the hardcore urge to rage you will get from all the broken guns and specialists and this whole thing was all in my opinion and if you guys dissagree you either havent bought this for pc yet or you are just another blind call of duty fan boy yours sadly josh
