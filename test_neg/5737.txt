2016 idea is great but the game is really bad full of bugs hitbox is awful matchmaking is like the servers would be a bunch of potatoes and the game itself is really luck based the shooting system is more like in recent cod s than in cs go there are a lot of bugs what people use to kill and also several cheaters teammates f ck up your game 1 5 times however the community is not bad better than in cs go comparing the pros cons i don t recommend this game 5 10
