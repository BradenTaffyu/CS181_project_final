2016 almost 400 hours into the game i think i have a decent grasp on whether or not this is a good game the game is decent but good lord the hackers and script kiddies ruin this game the cheating is so prevalent that rockstar has instituted a draconian ban detection system that bans innocent players i got banned while running missions with a friend who somehow didnt get banned as well for a week and a half im not waiting out this ban just to get unfairly banned again in the future instantly uninstalled the game and will not play again i do not cheat in games and take it personally when i m accused of it tl dr game is decent but the level of cheaters absolutely ruins it if you buy don t get surprised if you get hacked or get banned without reason
