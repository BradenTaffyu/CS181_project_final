2022 giving this game a negative review simply because of the 70 price tag you would think if they are going to make us pay more for their game they would at least release a finished product and not this unpolished piece of crap and for all of the people saying they increased the price to make sure they made a profit you re stupid i can guarantee that extra 10 from each player did nothing but boost their profits and they still would have earned a ridiculous amount of money for this game if they would have charged 60
