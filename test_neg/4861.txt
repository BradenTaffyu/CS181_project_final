2022 pros the campaign is enjoyable with friends cons there is no way in hell this game is worth 69 99 the content in this is too little for that kind of price and they still charge 30 for a battle pass or 20 for skins for an operator honestly this game feels like a 40 50 game march 11 2023 there is a sorta pay to win system in the game so this pay to win gives you advantages in dmz in which you spawn with extra items when other don t and you can buy weapon skins which then give up a gun with a certain set up and sometimes these are really broken when you first launch it you need to make an account i don t know why they couldn t use my steam or battle net like other game after you re done game restarts to log you in what okay whatever i want to play the campaign game restarts new update game restarts why the does it do this a 69 99 game shouldn t do this genshin impact doesn t do that the gun in this game i will give it to them is a nice selection but tell me why some guns are unlocked through the battle pass or why do i have to use a certain gun to unlock another gun when some guns are unlocked via leveling up also there are like only three shotguns in this game the fourth one is just another shotgun with a magazine they could ve made that an attachment the attachment unlock system is absolute it forces you to a different gun to get an attachment for another gun the perk system in this game is ass you will spend half of the game with only one or two perks and forget about the last one you had equipped since you gain the perks as the match goes on and by the time you unlock your last two it pointless for example ghost which makes you undetectable from uav is an ultimate perk by the time you get to it you would ve encounter like 10 uavs thus making it useless since the match is 75 done the only useful perk is battle harden hardline and bomb squad because those are tier one or two this game crashes freeze and disconnect so damn much playing campaign crash playing multiplayer with friends freeze then disconnect then crashes playing warzone freeze then crash the operators they are so poorly design like both sides have the same color scheme and look similar to one another so in a match you re going to end up shooting teammates thinking they re enemies and ignoring enemies because they look like allies the cdl operator is the stupidest thing ever this character is basically copy and paste for both team so its impossible to tell who friend or foe in a firefight the ui in this game is trash the damn thing was like it was designed for a streaming service very similar to the ui of netflix or disney plus also there are time where words are not properly fitted into the box so they go outside the boxes the riot shield its annoying as all hell especially when a teammate has it on their back and they run in front of you so you end up shooting their shield while they get killed by the enemy you were shooting at and then you get killed by the same enemy armor piercing round does not work on them either like what the there s a mode that is quite similar to rainbow six siege in which you have one life and must be tactical to complete a task so why the hell are killstreaks allowed round starts and your whole team gets mowed down by a vtol and its over when you lose connection to the game it or something a message will a appear saying something like server disconnected profile signed out and then the game will close and no i do not mean you will be put back into the main menu the game close out completely taking you back to desktop why the hell does the harrier fall on the map once it gets shot down and when doing so get the person even more free kills its especially annoying when you respawn and it lands on you killing you and like 5 other teammates dropshots and jumpshots
