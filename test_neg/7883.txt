the most toxic community i ve ever witnessed in any game the entire game loop here revolves around being a toxic with the excuse of its a pirate game bro it s sea of thieves not sea of friends as an excuse to be trash human being the dev s flat out lie they say we made a sandbox so you can play however you want however you cannot just play the pve experience without massive penalties and a sub par game experience they absolutely do not let people play however they want they try to force everyone into playing the toxic grief farm that they conceived thinking it s a good game model they just announced this will be releasing for ps5 most likely because they cannot keep a player base due to their trash game mechanics of this whole game being based on griefing other players nothing says crap mechanics like grinding for 2 4 hours just to have a group of assclowns that outnumber you by 3 4 swoop in and take your aside from the graphics physics ship waves etc this game is garbage they took a great foundation and made the worst possible game loop they could on top of that foundation this game could have been special instead it s the place to go if you want to see what the worst of humanity has to offer the only reason people play this game is because there is a lack of any good pirate games on the market particularly first person pirate games where you get to play the pirate not the ship
