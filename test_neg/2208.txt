apex currently has audio issues performance issues netcode issues security issues someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro s during a live streamed algs regional final the infected accounts were banned and the pro s had to use brand new accounts imagine the amount of time and money wasted because ea and respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue then one of the banned account showed up in the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be on another livestream so ea and respawn still haven t fixed severe security issues but hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine which brings me to the next point at least five different in game currencies cheaters galore both on pc and consoles again respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics account progress issues your money can be transferred to ea just fine but your might not receive your in game currency items oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game such great fun that is now you wanna know what respawn and ea are focusing on in the upcoming season 22 spoiler alert it s not any of the actual issues i listed above no dear reader instead they are focusing on making the battles pass which you can currently acquire using apex coins a paid item your premium in game currency was just rendered useless previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it you had enough ac to buy it again next season now they want you to buy the battle pass with only with actual money and there are two premium tiers with premium having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise oh you think that s bad they will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to pay twice in one season apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year now they chug out map redesigns add maybe one weapon per year at best and skip new legends every other season to spend time and resources on qol improvements apex has been losing players consistently in the past months and a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 bp changes were announced if respawn and ea chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum the game would be in a much much better place save your time money and sanity in its current state apex is not worth it
