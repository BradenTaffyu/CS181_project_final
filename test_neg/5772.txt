2020 i cannot recommend this game in the state its in it s a buggy mess with cheaters in about half of games above silver rank the meta has been destroyed to the point where on attack most rounds are spent clearing traps for minutes and bumrushing at the very end and the balance changes brought on by the new team have done nothing but worsened and bloated the experience the monitezation is quite possibly the most aggressive out of any modern aaa game if you buy the standard edition you don t have access to a large swathe of operators same goes for the deluxe and gold editions meaning you must pay or grind for them then with subsequent updates comes new operators meaning that if you want to have full access you must purchase a season pass want cosmetics there is a paid battlepass on top of the season pass in addition to paid only premium skins and lootboxes in the form of alpha packs want some of the cool limited time skins awesome just pay for lootboxes in the limited set the features in this game are beyond poor you have the core game and an outdated terrorist hunt that s it and both are riddled with bugs and hardly work so for a barely functioning defunct product you are compelled to purchase the game purchase additional operators a season pass a battle pass premium skins limited time lootboxes and standard lootboxes which have duplicates oh how the mighty have fallen
