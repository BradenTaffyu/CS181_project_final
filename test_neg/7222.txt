this review is coming from a somewhat specific point of view i have mixed feelings but i must settle on negative and it isn t due to the performance issues or microtransactions throughout i will compare the first and second game there will also be some spoilers though i ll try to be ambiguous vague wherever possible whilst keeping relevancy in mind older dragon s dogma 1 dark arisen players may be able to more accurately pick up or relate to what i say firstly i believe this isn t emphasized enough but the game itself is by and large an almost identical copy of the first game dragon s dogma dark arisen ddda normally this is not a bad thing i believe that if something is good and if it works then there s no reason to change it of course making improvements and adding innovation to that existing formula without overly modifying it is good and welcome but when it comes to dragon s dogma 2 i d argue that some things went in reverse starting with something very simple npc conversation camera in the first game ddda when we talk to some notable npcs your character s silhouette will completely vanish and the camera will focus solely on that npc it made for conversation to be more personal it was the case with most notable npcs not all mind you in dd2 when conversing with notable npcs apart from the innkeepers shopkeepers there s very minor zoom and focus connected to that are the npcs themselves more specifically the beastren race you may notice that the npcs are very generic same repeating voice lines even having the same voices the first game ddda was also somewhat similar and to some this is likely inconsequential but i feel like this takes away from the whole point of making a new region and a new race if you re simply going to palette swap the environment and give fur to the npcs they could have kept the same repeating generic voice lines but why not make it so that the beastren npcs have distinctive vocal undertone or perhaps a slightly different manner of speech compared to the human npcs to me both human and beastren npcs seemed to have the same voice actors and the same generic dialogue excluding unique npcs of course moving onto the gameplay there s really nothing quite wrong with this aspect dragon s dogma 1 2 honestly is just a hack and slash simulator with exploration as more of an afterthought except they have stripped down some of the abilities spells of the vocations classes that were present in the first game i cannot comment on how impactful it is for other vocations as i mostly played sorcerer in both games but quite a number of spells were taken away from the sorcerer vocation i could have lived with that if they simply didn t make the default light attack of sorcerers useless compared to how it was in ddda the default light attack be it charged or not is simply garbage in a way this felt a bit crippling and perhaps some other vocation may feel crippled as well due to having their abilities from the first game removed but i don t know enough to comment on this yet what else the lack of anything considerably original new so the region of vermund human kingdom is essentially just a different version of the first game s gransys region nothing too new about it there was one notable new boss type enemy added the dullahan though you are very unlikely to encounter unless you travel to a specific location at nighttime this is once again fine but not so in the case of the brand new region of battahl i was expecting at least 2 or 3 new common enemy types but sadly everything was the same as vermund in terms of enemy variety and general environmental design all the enemies were simply given a new coat of texture and made substantially stronger nothing too new was here either apart from the addition of a single new enemy in the battahl region this being medusa but you literally only encounter it in one very specific location that you can easily miss or never explore one could also argue that medusa is just a replacement of the first game s evil eye and hydra bosses combined so in a way it wasn t that new paired with the npcs sounding same the whole region battahl just felt like vermund with an orange coat of paint i will admit that the new battahl only ropeway station mechanic was a bit fun at first but that s about it now you might be asking is there anything that s spectacularly new or original well there s the sphinx and her riddles some fun to be had there onto the story there s a lot to unpack here and if nothing has been spoiled for you considerably yet the next few paragraphs might take a look at the cover image of dragon s dogma 2 we see someone clad in armor in the middle and two other characters to the left and right the character in the middle is intended to be us the arisen the one on the right is ulrika a relatively important individual in early part of the game now the character on the left is the beastren kingdom s empress nadinia one would guess that she is obviously going to be important to our questing right wrong she is about as useful as any standard side quest npc the interactions with her is so little that its hardly worth mentioning and while in battahl its constantly mentioned that the empress dances in the public for her people but did capcom bother to even put that sort of minor animation in the game no they did not before going further into the main plot i d like to mention a certain mechanic that existed in the first game ddda the beloved mechanic simply put all npcs have an affinity meter which increases if you do things for them or gift them items the highest affinity npc will eventually be locked in for romance in the final bits of the main quest by romance i mean that they get kidnapped near the end and they get a dedicated intimate moment and cutscene and would live in your house during post game content dragon s dogma 2 also has that mechanic sort of problem is the highest affinity npc doesn t get a cutscene and doesn t live with you in your house however they do show up at the very end of the credits for 4 seconds and smiles at the camera while looking at the horizon what do i even say but hold on even though the highest affinity npc gets kidnapped in this game they aren t locked in as your romance because if for some reason you get higher affinity with a new npc in post game then that new npc shows up in the credits instead the beloved system was pretty mediocre in the first game but now it just might as well not exist this may sound contentious but i think the game does bit of a disservice to the original lore of the first game the pathfinder doesn t seem like the seneschal we are aware of in the first game it could be true that this a different world in the multiverse and if the pathfinder plays the same role as the seneschal did in the first game ddda then there should have been a little bit more exposition apart from their monotone narration it seems an awful lot of game s budget was poured into making the action cinematics and cutscenes in the lead up to post game and a little after it the rest felt as it was simply copy pasted the from the first game while stripping away the things that made the original great not just spells skills abilities even a lot of the consumables curatives were removed or overly simplified my personal dissatisfaction is from the lack of one of the best items liquid vim that was removed now every time my pawn says we now have the vim to tackle the day after resting it s blatantly obvious that we don t have the vim and we may possibly never will in short this may be a good game but its certainly not a good sequel it also lacks proper regional pricing nostalgia made me fork over 80 usd i implore trying the first game instead but all this is just one man s nuanced opinion
