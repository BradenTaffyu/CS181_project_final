2023 same as most everyone else using the two pronged communication of negative steam review and not purchasing the dlc to let the company know that i don t like the way they are handling content release pricing for the game i m a long time fan of total war probably have 5 000 combined hours play time and have spent plenty of money on the franchise over the years i would be willing to pay for a dlc that was more than a few new lords and units maybe rather than piecemeal dlc s here and there stick to a more expansion type release with plenty of meat on the bone i m not 100 sure what the solution should be but i am 100 sure i don t like things the way they are maybe studio costs are so high that they need to charge 25 for a small dlc and maybe there is some cohort of spendthrift gamers out there who they are counting on to prove such a price tag as viable if that s the case i guess i ll just wish them well and stick with what i already have
