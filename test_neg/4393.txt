2019 now i know what y all are thinkin why is this dude giving wf a negative review despite it s pretty awesome gameplay and good replayability well i can say wf is a good game it s really good and i do recommend it above all else but this is to be a wake up call and a reminder to be cautious about sinking anything into this gamei spent a good maybe 100 atleast and logged 243 hours into this game enjoying all of what it had to offer to me and one day i can t logon amidst a growing problem i read negative plat balance so i think weird so i open up a support ticket asking what was going on and maybe see what i had done wrong but a day later i realize what s up and add a comment onto my ticket stating that i knew what was going on and stated that it was being taken care of by the bank i wait 8 or so weeks and see what they d say now keep in mind they technically can t take back content that s used within the game atleast from my understanding so i m left with a 4084 plat balance which was accumulated by me purchasing the previous prime access chroma and some other platinum bundles for more stuff within wf so fast forward over to late january i get an email saying my tickets been responded to i check it out i get the zendeskbot telling me the same crap i was told when i looked this problem up to investigate further about what it meant and afterwards my ticket was closed and i just resigned myself from wf my acc forever locked because 4084 plat translated over to real world currency is just 100 usd for me to spend in order to get back in now the takeaway warframe isn t a bad game by any means it has its own lovely community a tight knit thing of systems and mechanics etc etc but the only bad i got with it is the customer support there have been some reviews complaining about it and it hasn t been solved from what i ve heard so until this get s fixed i have to leave this here so de can open their eyes and get better at supporting a larger audience who may run into troubles like these edit as of a few days ago i ve casted off my 4084 debt and am playing warframe again but this will not change my review one bit my point still stands and i hope they look back on it and dozens of other reviews like this and fix their support
