2021 even post captaincy this game is still in desperate need of content that actual drives the players its a good experience but everything ultimately feels fruitless gold is effectively worthless and there is deliberately no real progression every reward eventually liquidates into a useless yellow currency there is real opportunity for mechanics like equipment crafting i don t see the point in making everything unlock able via gold one you get what you want there is no point hoarding it beyond seeing the number go up why not make it that the different loot you collect has different meaningful value why should a kraken meg and skeleton crew all drop effectively the same thing whats worse is that eventually these cool experiences become inconveniences and about as interesting as the in game weather you ve effectively made a tech demo with a theme park built on top i would understand the choice to make lateral content like quests if it actually built upon the gameplay in a meaningful way but it doesn t rare even identified this and made a safe little bubble for a pirates life so the kiddies didn t get stomped by experienced players when looking for captain jack swallows pvp is the only evergreen gratifying content to most experienced gamers it has the same appeal as rust i don t need this stuff but taking it away from you is the fun part but the game simply isn t designed for it google sot hitreg and you ll find 1000 s of threads it also doesn t help that your most economically rewarding encounters in this game against other players will always be when ganking terrible or new players it doesn t feel rewarding to sneak onto someones boat with a keg for the 9th time granted it does have hold my beer energy and i ll get some laughs from new players who ve never seen it before literally every person i ve played this game with has been surprised when they hear there is no progression half the time it kicks the wind out of their sails and they end up dropping the game within a week for something else which is such a shame its painfully obvious there is a massive hole in the middle of your game rare and you ve repeatedly ignored the warnings and don t heed your own communities advice this game would be an empty corpse and cautionary tale if not for it being free on game pass you lucked out being microsoft s golden child the game play and actual experience of this game is s tier but the design philosophy and direction make this truly wasted potential
