2020 be aware that this game is bundled with some crappy xbox live account joining friends with this system is a hassle and god forbid you forget your xbox live credentials let s face it you already did which you are required to re enter from time to time for no good reason in that case you need a new account and re add all your friends and all you gold is lost too as for the game itself looks beautiful but get s boring fast missions are repetitive and since the game insists on placing teams of all sizes on the same server most encounters are pretty much one sided even stupider even though all 3 boat classes are allowed on the same server you can t change yours on the fly when friends join or leave the game update it happened again a friend of mine was locked out of her account despite having the password saved in a password manager only this time she could not create a new account and verifying your old one takes days no thanks
