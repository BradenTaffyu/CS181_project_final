2023 warhammer 2 was a great success but with migration to new engine a lot of fighting mechanics core ones got lost units still do not fight properly and lose targets base units struggle to kill lord due to failed targeting it takes already year and a half for them to fix it moreover the price for new dlc sucks usually it is a price of race pack but we are given only three lords i just hope their mechanics will be insane otherwise that s a big sad way too overpriced but it is a it is in this industry paradox guys are a lot worsei m a big fan of total warhammer franchise but i wouldn t recommend for new comers give it another year to fix bugs the modder community really gives big hopes they release their own races bug fixes map expansions unit animations and it is strong so the future of this game is bright but not in the current state of things
