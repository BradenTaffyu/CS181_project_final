2016 this game had such potential leave it to ubisoft to f ck up a good thing while the multiplayer is pretty sound despite the bugs please for the love of jesus mary and joseph stay away from terrorist hunt it s absolute dog sh t the game literally cheats because the developers weren t talented enough to make intelligent challenging ai without giving the enemies aimbot and wall hacks i ve seen grenades go through solid walls bots throw flashbangs backwards like a pitcher throwing a baseball towards home plate but the ball goes the opposite direction you ll be shot through walls without the enemy ever having line of sight of you shielded enemies can hipfire headshot you from 30 feet away bots are impervious to smoke bombs as they ll still lock onto you even though there s a thick cloud of smoke with zero visibility i ve also seen them be impervious to flashbangs where one goes off right in front of them and they re unaffected etc they also know when you re controlling a drone as a bot will run up and shoot you in your dumb face while you re looking at the drone feed even though just prior to that you stood in the same spot for ten minutes without a bot ever coming close to your position it s truly disgusting there are for sure issues i m forgetting as a human couldn t possibly remember all the issues with this game off the top of their head as they re too plentiful an enemy will be slowly walking scanning left and right and then all of a sudden without ever seeing you he ll quickly turn 90 or 180 degrees and put his iron sights directly on you it s so insane the ai essentially have aimbot as their sights are literally stuck to your head following even your slightest movements as if the barrel of their gun is attached to your dome i also take issue with the bombers in terrorist hunt they re ridiculous and out of place while most of the game has a focus on realism the bombers are an embarrassing departure from that it s straight up some call of duty crap they literally fire their aug s one handed while running towards you yet they retain the accuracy as if they were firing it normally with both hands if you let a bomber kill you with his aug instead of his bomb and then watch the kill cam you ll see him holding his aug with both hands just like any other terrorist even though in third person the bomber is holding a detonator in one hand his aug in the other and he s sprinting towards you that s how lazy these devs are hip firing a bullpup rifle with one hand while running full speed and squeezing a detonator in the other hand ubisoft s idea of realism i don t understand what they were thinking putting those in the game also the fact that it takes multiple headshots to kill them even with glaz marksman rifle is another gross departure from the realism the game has focused on it s especially silly when you consider the operator tachanka has a steel ballistic helmet over his entire head yet he s still a one shot headshot but some f ck face in a white hazmat suit can eat several shots to the dome with even the most powerful weapon stop it ubi you re making me laugh now how about the time limit on the upper difficulties why is this a thing i understand a time limit on multiplayer but why is it in terrorist hunt more importantly why is it so short why give me only twelve minutes to go hunt and kill nearly thirty enemies by myself it goes against everything this game was trying to be a slow methodical shooter it s not a call of duty run and gun shooter but the time limit forces me to play like that they don t even make the time limit scale depending on how many players there are as a lone wolf it s kinda difficult to rush thirty enemies and kill them all in under twelve minutes especially when i m dealing with all the sh t i ve listed above in just the last year they have truly killed terrorist hunt it s a giant slap in the face to any of the players who enjoyed this game mode they ve turned it into practice for their pvp players they easily could of made both groups happy having the option to choice classic t hunt or practice mode the worst part is how they turned every map into an airsoft arena all the realism of the maps is completely gone they all just feel like paintball courses now at least before the maps felt like real places you actually felt like an elite law enforcement operator storming a terrorist strong hold that s why maps were based off real locations in the first place but every map is now a contrived e sports playground it s so sad what a joke this game has become what year of season pass are we on now year fifteen why make a new game when players will pay you half the cost of a new game every single year for 5 of the content a full game would have you don t even get new weapons anymore and people are still giving ubi money to keep this travesty of a game alive all these players are doing is enabling corporations like ubisoft to be a bunch of lazy greedy ballbags
