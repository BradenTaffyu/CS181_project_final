2021 absolutely amazing game with the most toxic pvp community possible if you don t like the idea of being preyed on and hunted then spawn camped and killed repeatedly for fun while enemy players chant lewd and violent mantras at you i would have my account shut down if i repeated some of what s been said to me then give this game a hard pass and heaven forbid if you bring the issue up in discussions you ll be eaten alive by people defending pvp as the holy grail of gaming and told you re an idiot who ought to play other games instead you re not allowed to have opinions about pvp other than abject adoration i d love the game if not for the toxic community as it stands the developers are pushing the pvp element harder and harder with each update so i ve unfortunately lost interest in the game i feel cheated and kinda wish i could get back those hours i spent along with my money it s a pretty expensive game considering the number of trolls and people out to make you miserable i really really really wanted to like this game it s got such beautiful animation and ambiance i loved fighting the ghost skeleton ships exploring islands fighting krakens and megaladons and doing the tall tales i ve just never had a single good encounter with other players in this game and considering it s a pvpve game that s not a great sign
