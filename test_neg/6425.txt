2020 firstly i would just like to say that i am not an amazing dbd player my rank usually stays between 5 and 7 so there are much more experienced people who can give a more comprehensive and accurate review of this game than i can however as someone who has played over 600 hours of this game of both killer and survivor i think i know at least a little starting off the developer team is very out of touch with how it s game is played and it s playerbase and is shown whenever they only listen to one side or the other when considering balance changes if you want to play killer get ready for an uphill battle as you will be verbally berated at the end of maybe half of your matches by survivors for simple things like going back to check on a hooked survivor who hasn t been saved for awhile playing a killer that you enjoy to play but survivors find annoying or overpowered using perks that they deem annoying not farming for points with survivors when they want to or even making a few simple mistakes during a match even when you re new to the game if you want to play survivor it s very simple and easy to get away with a pip rank progression most matches because the game is much more rigged in your favor you have 3 other teammates that the killer can chase to give you time to complete objectives other than being chased for pipping however killers can feel pressured to continuously chase survivors off of generators and never be able to commit to a fun or exciting chase or pressured to ignore the generators and just go for one good chase since how hopeless it feels to keep people off of generators my review is definitely killer biased but that is because while it is becoming easier and more fun as survivor killer matches only feel stressful and frustrating i do still love the idea of playing killer but it is definitely not the power role anymore as you feel like you are the one being dragged through hoops most of the match i do not recommend this game because the whole thing just feels like a joke and has become too tiring for me to care enough anymore to stick with it
