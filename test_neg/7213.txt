combat is top tier the loot system is actual garbage everything good i had was bought in shops the last half falls off hard it almost feels like they tried to do something different but failed the stuff they tried to innovate in did not work the fast travel aspect was cool at first but definitely becomes way too tedious after traveling the same road 30 times saving grace of the game were the fights
