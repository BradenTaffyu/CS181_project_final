2022 best summary for this game the more you play it the less you ll like it elden ring starts off as a superb engaging exploration of a wide world with many fixed encounters that you learn to navigate and overcome but eventually overcoming challenges only means finding one of the various cheesy weapons and spells available and spamming the hell out of it this issue overflows in pvp where despite a wealth of equipment available you will always face off against opponents using the same few strategies because cheesing is encouraged by the core mechanics of the game and doing anything else becomes increasingly drawn out and frustrating you ll burn out and some point and start outright skipping normal pve encounters because they aren t worth the time and resources they take you to defeat and you just don t care anymore i ve played every souls game before and while each had a level here and there it never felt generalized like that elden ring seems to be lacking this unique quality present in previous souls game where you could do fairly well with any equipment that you felt comfortable with both in pve and pvp it may be because some ashes of war and spells are simply too good too spammable in this game while previously you mostly relied on basic attacks and movement no matter the weapon special moves were there but didn t take center stage enemies didn t need to be so numerous and spongy pvp didn t need to be a cheesefest the few offending weapons were patched and many people who beat you were actually good and deserved it i m still gonna play elden ring for a while but i think their design decisions are such that this drawn out cheese to win design is irreversible and won t be mended until their next game it is because because i know that from software can do better that i am posting this negative review feel free to play and see for yourself
