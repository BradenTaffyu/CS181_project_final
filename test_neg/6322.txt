2023 this game has done a great job of bringing horror to the mainstream and i love that a simple premise one killer attempts to find and kill sacrifice 4 survivors whose job it is to fix some generators in order to power the exit gates through which they can escape i still remember my first match sneakily running around the killer in giddy excitement as i made my escape the experience is made even better by all the classic horror characters in the game such as ghostface michael myers freddy krueger leatherface pinhead it goes on chases where the survivor attempts to get away from the killer are great fun as it rewards mind games and map knowledge it never felt unfair to get beaten by a better player who outplayed me with skill and technique it is also very rewarding trying to save your downed teammates from the killer as it really plays into the mouse vs cat idea that the game is built on unfortunately it is weighed down by so much that i just can t recommend it in good faith some are fairly simple issues to correct others would basically require the game to be completely overhauled they are as follows and they are very numerous playing survivor sucks at a core level for the survivors where they must escape a bloodthirsty killer one killer oni literally gets his power from spilt blood you d be surprised to learn that the core gameplay consists of gen repair simulator and just holding down mouse 1 m1 to win you must repair 5 generators and then an exit gate to escape to repair a generator your character sits still and just idly repairs it with m1 with a basetime of 90 seconds then you need to unhook heal your team which also consists of holding m1 idly occasionally you ll find a hex totem which needs to be cleansed by holding m1 trying to open the exit gate to escape interact with certain killer items open chest for items you guessed it idly hold m1 not only is the core gameplay extremely boring and noninteractive it gets even worse when you realise that the time taken to do all that can increase dramatically with certain killer perks unfortunately this gameplan of regressing progress of all those aforementioned actions is considered meta so as a survivor you can expect to idly hold m1 for more than half your game time some times the game can be stretched out for up to 40 minutes despite all core objectives taking less than 8 minutes in total that is assuming you don t get camped tunnelled out of the game in the first two minutes now obviously you do get the chance to be in chase with the killer and this is where the real and only fun lies the problem is that the amount of enjoyment you get from this lies largely with the killer you can attempt to bait the killer to chase you but they have the simple opportunity of just ignoring you and thus in a 4v1 game by only trying to get chases you are essentially a man down which means that those 3 other survivors will spend even longer doing all those boring tasks now there certainly are games where you spend the entire time in chase and those are the best matches but the simple reality is that they are the exception not the rule when you think of survivor don t think exciting blood pumping chases instead think chore simulator because that is what the majority of the gameplay and by extension playing effectively is gameplay that fundamentally rewards unfun playstyles for killer tunnelling and camping playstyles that are considered by virtually all to be terrible and bad for the health of the game are very effective for the killer it s a 1v4 game you ask any person how to deal with a 1v4 they would say get rid of one or more as soon as possible that is achieved by focusing on killing one survivor as quickly as possible for the killer it works but it really does suck to be on the receiving end as a survivor another toxic thing that is rewarded is gen slow down the only real fun part of the game lies in chases yet the meta is centred around regressing generator progress and drawing out the game for as long as possible personally i think it would be better if the game tried to focus more on improving the chase experience but there exists an arm race mentality in the community where one side picks gens perks items and the other responds in kind all in all the chases for killer are the most fun but the way things are set up means at times you aren t optimized for it by design toxic and bad survivor teammates a lack of basic team communication means that more often than not you will have some teammates doing everything and others doing nothing i have had a plethora of experiences where i can be looping the killer for minutes on end and yet no generators will be complete get hooked and die only for the worst teammates to escape this is made even worse when you realise just how bad of the killer vs survivor mindset is both sides are constantly trying to one up the other by waiting around at the end of the game to t bag in safety and killers camping and tunnelling resulting in some players not getting to play the game at all this becomes even more of an issue when you realise just how bad the matchmaking in this game is i remember vividly how my first match ever was against a killer who had 700 hours and in my last games as a high tier killer i would consistently get brand new survivors who have just installed the game obviously there are good survivor teammates and killers who are nice people but i think that you will notice the toxic side first this game has really bad balancing some killers remain ridiculously strong and with limited counterplay e g nurse blight and others remain ridiculously weak e g clown and trapper add ons are also a big problem for some they are borderline overpowered and can completely change the game e g nurse s range clown s pinkie finger for other killers most of them are all low tier and barely worth using e g executioner and nemesis some killers like hag still don t have counterplay when it comes to her camping traps you need to bring flashlights crackers in the pre game lobby before you even know who you are up against and some others are just extremely annoying to play against such as thanatophobia legion yet killers such as hillbilly still have artificial restraints placed on them such as an overheating chainsaw do not expect good balancing from this game brightness and the colour palette is a major problem you can t change brightness in game the claim is that it would provide an unfair advantage however you can do it on your monitor which personally messes with my eyes so why not just add it in to the game there are so many maps that are unnecessarily dark and in some instances are all but impossible to see at times maps such as midwich elementary school garden of joy s main house and some autohaven maps this is made even worse by some killers and their powers trapper and hag s traps are at times impossible to see and dredge can greatly darken the screen multiple times in a match to the point where you can barely see anything front of you the end result is that some maps are so visually bad that when loading into them i instantly disconnect because it is just that bad there are a number of other issues that i could go on such as poor accessibility lacks features other games take for granted bad bloodweb design and a very consumer unfriendly monetary practice i would have included them all but steam has a limit on how much you can put in a review lol all in all the times where the game worked for me was less than when it didn t so i just can t recommend it please go play something else and don t waste your money and time here
