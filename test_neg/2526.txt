2022 product received for free i could write an entire textbook on why this game sucks ass with cited examples and sources but that won t fit in a steam review so i ll summarize the devs do not give 1 singular about this game or franchise none of the current dev team are trustworthy and all they care about is the money they get from recolors of old skins and random color patterns the devs have an extensive and well documented history of directly lying to their players over several years and across multiple games not just apex the skill based matchmaking in this game has been entirely nonfunctional since season 12 which was in early 2022 and it is impossible to play this game casually pubs the non ranked gamemode will put anyone against anyone else and that means the champion squad is always a premade team of 3 of the top 0 04 of players in the world real number not exaggerated in ranked which is supposed to be the competitive gamemode that matches you against people of similar rank skill there are skill brackets that it uses to put people into matches but they barely exclude any ranks at all and are rarely even used so it is possible to see the highest rank in the world in a lobby with the lowest rank in the world this is a known and extremely well documented problem that has been going on for over a year and will likely never be fixed because it is functioning as designed yes you read that right the matchmaking is not broken in any way and is functioning exactly as intended on top of the matchmaking the audio in this game specifically enemy footsteps doesn t work 40 of the time and the servers have performance comparable to a 2012 model macbook with constant stutters rubber banding freezes the occasional slow motion server etc this is a multi billion dollar game with infinitely worse performance function and servers than pretty much any indie game i have ever played i cannot say it enough do not play this game and if you must do not ever think about giving a cent to this lying credit stealing backstabbing scam company i wish this game was good it has the framework to be great it was good once but the devs ruined it against the wishes of their players do not play this game
