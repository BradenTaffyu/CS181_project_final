i really love counter strike i loved cs go and i love the idea of cs 2 why is this review bad because valve up the execution of this idea so bad that it s kinda hard to believe 1 the anti cheat it is literally not existent there are cheaters everywhere in higher ranks at launch there were tons of false bans which is what leads me to believe that valve disabled the ac until they can make sure that no one is getting falsely banned anymore unfortunately this results in spinbotters aimhackers wallhackers and bhop scripters going absolutely wild in comp premiere and wingman there are people spraying the awp and teleporting to the second bomb site in wingman how is that even possible 2 the net code it s bad really bad there is rubber banding faulty hit reg the tagging teleports you back from behind cover movement feels off and i m sure there is more that i missed 3 the servers they re now hardcoded to 64 tick afaik they lag badly sometimes i ve had people just teleporting all over the place this was visible to everyone not just me there is constant package loss downloading demos is buggy sometimes the subtick system doesn t solve in fact the gameplay feels so much worse than in any other shooter 4 the linux build valve is known to care a lot about linux support and so do i to say that i was disappointed when i first fired up cs 2 on my linux powered gaming pc would be an understatement cs go s linux build was flawless it was better than the windows build especially when it comes to performance but cs 2 sound didn t work performance is still unacceptable sound will sometimes vanish in the middle of a game and for some people the game didn t even start up another fun one is that on certain mesa versions smokes are invisible free and undetectable wallhacks for everyone with and intel or amd gpu oh wait the game doesn t work properly on intel gpus i believe this is also the case on windows so screw arc users i guess 5 the windows build you thought valve wouldn t up the windows build apparently you re wrong i don t run the windows built myself so i can only speak for some of my friends who are running windows apparently it s really unstable a friend of mine constantly experienced crashes others had awful performance just like i have on the linux build and radeon users had a really bad time with shader stutter at least valve fixed that one now 6 content i m not gonna make a detailed list here basically cs 2 is missing 60 of cs go s content i m talking maps player models modes even features and console commands rip cl righthand 0 note left handed view models are back game still sux tho 7 the discontinuation of cs go i wouldn t be so mad if valve just gave us the option to continue to play the better cs cs go unfortunately they don t give us this option match making is gone and community servers are almost always completely empty if you can even find a working one the server browser if because it shows both cs go and cs 2 servers and setting up a community server yourself requires an obscure sourcemods plugin to un the lobby system otherwise no one can join the server if you disable lan mode the plugin is called nolobbyreservation i know why valve did it but i honestly do not care if cs 2 is so bad that nobody will play it if they have the option then it should not be released stop forcing this garbage onto us and let us play cs go again until you managed to make cs 2 as playable as the other counter strike titles
