2022 i ve been playing this game since release for basically only the zombies gamemode i really love this game and i appreciate all custom map devs that have been single handedly keeping this game alive for the last 5 years unfortunately hackers now have a mod menu that provides a list of every player that s online and can grief every single person by bricking your dlc s kicking you offline grabbing your ip and more this basically made black ops 3 100 unsafe to play unless you re in offline mode and that means you cant play with friends so it s solo or a no go tons of support tickets have been made and sent to treyarch and they ve been radio silent on the issue for years play this game at your own discretion i have no doubt that cod will not come back to this game to fix it simply because it isn t profitable hopefully the community can work out a patch for these exploits but for now i can t recommend this game until this get s fixed if it ever gets fixed
