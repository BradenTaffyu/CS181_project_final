2022 most disappointing game since cyberpunk being a big fan of total war games in general and total war warhammer ii in particular i really expected to love this game however this broken betrayal of a product is not worth your time or money in its present state indiana jones and the race for the soul fragmentsthe rifts to chaos realms opening up could have been a very interesting addition to the game however the way the game works is that you win the game by entering these rifts and collecting soul fragments this could be an interesting sort of dynamic story challenge if not for the fact that every other faction can do the same thing meaning that even when you are playing in single player the whole game just turns into race for the soul fragments very early in the campaign i m not the only one who noticed this angry joe noted that this killed the campaign in his review skip to 27 25 youtube video total war warhammer iii angry review views 655 778 patreon yt join our new merch angryjoe gets in touch with his inner demon to rule the and mandalore gaming noted that this basically makes winning any other way almost impossible youtube video total war warhammer 3 review views 3 466 500 total war warhammer 3 has arrived in a month absolutely stacked for games this review covers anything and everything that came to mind so prepare for trees and menus what s worse the rifts can only be entered by your faction leader which means that winning the game is all about creating min maxed doomstacks and using them to play what is basically a bad moba rather than coordinating armies and managing kingdoms as you would in say an actual total war game broken storythis game has one of those awful stories that was clearly put together by people who worked separately and hated each other for instance the story clearly states that only a certain person can enter the realms of chaos to do the thing needed to win the game but literally every ai faction actually does that the first chance they get characterization is also off for instance kostaltyn is a well played sympathetic character in cutscenes but he s an ugly deranged blowhard on the campaign map terrible performance and denuvokeep tolerating bugs and so will the devs this is the most unreliable total war game i have played so far with all of the issues you might expect including broken ai that can t move properly constant de synchs in multiplayer and of course crashes that frequently cause you to lose your progress after a tough battle it s impossible to tell how many of these problems are linked to the use of denuvo but it certainly isn t helping conclusionthis is the first total war game for which i have posted a negative review and i have been playing the series since the early 2000s this game made me sad
