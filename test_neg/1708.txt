2022 they release an unfinished game and then procede to try to sell a dlc that should already be in the game but hey we got immortal empires bro companies cant keep delivering their promises and saying its a gift i stuck with the game even when it sucked and so have many others then have the audacity to charge money for the dlc when they shouldve just been in the game ca has become a bunch of cash wh res very disappointed
