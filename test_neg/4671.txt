2022 not worth it at all ever since those infamous patents were leaked from cod ww2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point you re simply not allowed to have fun not a single chance you perform good in one match the game is gonna punish you for the following 4 5 matches skill based match making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels if sbmm was really working the way it was supposed to then explain me why 90 of the matches i m playing my team is full of room temperature iq players and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level why is this happening literally 9 10 matches every single time it s the same scenario since the game got released also if there is a ranked playlist called call of duty league why is sbmm present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times isn t the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience why is it prioritizing k d and w l ratio for matchmaking instead of ping extra note for sbmm why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby m4a1 needs 4 bullets deals 28 damage but sometimes i m getting 4 hitmarkers and i need a fifth bullet while in close quarters what is this infinity ward for some reason on this cod you cannot disable crossplay yes you read that right you cannot opt out of playing with console players now why would you do that you ask i don t know maybe because on this cod the aim assist controller players have is absolutely and i can t emphasize it enough way too strong like i can t bother calling it aim assist anymore it s aimbot for real it s aimbot you ll see them having the worst type of movement and the moment you re slightly next to their crosshair you re done they don t even have to ads it works even when hip firing you simply cannot escape it press f to respawn because the way they lock on into you with 100 accuracy there s no way you can win the gunfight sometimes even if you shoot first i get it controller needs something to help players with the fact that they re using just their thumbs to aim but i don t want to be a part of this i don t want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he ll be able to get kills it s simply way too strong and there are plenty of videos exposing this what i find the most irritating is why could we turn off crossplay on previous cods and now it s not possible isn t the game having the most pc players ever on the franchise because of the steam battle net combo some tl dr for you pros good gunplay good animations weapon family trees for leveling up your weapons many weapon camos attachments to unlock amd s fsr works pretty wellcons sbmm no crossplay opt out choice inconsistent footsteps audio no stopping power as a perk no ninja dead silence as a perk matches feel rigged edit 18 08 2024 so after many extra hours and upon reaching max level the more time i spent playing this the more it reinforced what i and many others have already said before to sum it up i ll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience i ve had with this game this one year and a half me and one of my friends are playing prisoner rescue for a two hour session in the night first hour goes fine we re both making good scores and we have a 7 game win streak we re seeing some new players and some old matches play fine with no problem nothing out of the ordinary happening now the second hour we re playing we re starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game we re getting teammates that are acting like they re playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives while the enemy team is either a 4 stack a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend it s a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend enemy weapons get such a fast ttk it feels like a single frame death meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone i was using g3a3 and my friend was using scar h and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a battle rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range also packet loss white color and packet burst orange color was appearing every few seconds for both of us but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session and of course let s not forget the enemies we re fighting have below 10 ping meanwhile my friend is at 40 and i m at 60 the game s algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent s better it s trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 k d and 1 w l as possible with whatever means it has available activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you re above average and can actually play good people who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem they re the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect because they re so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins if you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra low quality products you re getting from these companies
