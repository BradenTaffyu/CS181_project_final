i am a masochist and enjoy the online game loop for missions the actual game is still fun as a background noise experience however literally as of the day of writing they ve updated the game to make t unplayable on any linux devices cuz of battleeye ik this wont effect most players but i have mostly played this on my steam deck and it has frustratingly cut me out from playing
