2022 ca just said if we don t buy the new overpriced dlc troy 2 tw pharaoh they re gonna end support for warhammer 3 honestly screw ca and screw sega they ve had some real lows in the past but this is a whole new layer of filth they don t respect you or your wallet i m not paying their extortionate prices and neither should you it s not our problem if they make stupid decisions so why should we pay for it let warhammer 3 crash and burn if that s what they really want don t worry ca i m sure lawbreakers 2 0 hyenas and troy 2 are gonna do great
