for fans of the original 2012 release this game is a firm sidegrade in terms of combat repeatability and storytelling even the thing that i shall not spoil is a sidegrade to what we had in dragon s dogma 1 it follows in line with the resident evil remakes in terms of having slightly less janky fair systems that limit some of the wildly broken movesets from the first game while also reducing your skill roster to 4 skills instead of 6 and leaving out a lot of the high magicks and holy enchantments holy enchants are now baked into certain weapons iirc while slightly retelling the story of gransys into that of vermund s and battahl s at its current state performance qol and enemy varieties are lacking compared to dd1 i wouldn t buy it for at least two months as we wait for a sale patches to address these issues for new players it s a fairly standard action fantasy rpg that puts a large emphasis on action based combat rather than the usual turn based number ticking that you see from other jrpgs to that end you are given several classes with diverse fighting styles bot controlled allies called pawns that can adapt to your fighting style over the course of several hours and a sprawling world full of winding roads deep dungeons and scattering of towns and settlements to help it s not revolutionary it s not wow ing it just does the action part really well climbing larger enemies grappling small ones to set them up for finishers tossing especially small enemies into explosive barrels and off cliffsides etc are all fair game it definitely doesn t have baldur s gate level of complexity and creativity in terms of questlines and character interactions but the voice acting and localization is solid for all its pluses it does carry mechanics that put it in line with the older rpgs that it takes inspiration from single save files to avoid savescumming multiple quest endings that allow for failures to persist in the player s world a severe lack of fast travel points to emphasize the journey and timeliness essential npc deaths you can accumulate revive stones and visit the mortuary to revive important quest npcs but the fact that they can still die in things like random monster attacks on towns means you ll be on edge even in town it s not necessarily a bad thing these features do make things feel more urgent and grave just like older crpgs there are a few dealbreakers dragonsplague which essentially exists to destroy your save file if you ignore your pawn becoming disobedient and then holds that very same save file hostage by offering you an easy way out by selling you microtransaction revive stones to you so you can you know revive the entire town that was nuked because you didn t know what dragonsplague would do as a terminal effect it s a bit scummy imo since the eternal wakestone isn t omnipotent lack of new game button on release forces people to stay locked in save files the only way to manually remove old save files is to dig into the userdata folder on steam and find the right folder with which to delete those bin files especially bad for players who tinkered with the character creator and found out the character creator is not 1 1 with the actual game s lighting environs abysmal cpu bound performance rumor has it that a certain resizable bar setting is what clogs performance but essentially even the best consumer cpus cannot run this game above 90 fps in desolate empty areas cities and towns are always going to be a sub 60 fps experience with plenty of stuttering verdict again wait for a month or two to let the patches roll in and fix the game before giving this game a try as of 3 25 2024 i do not recommend this game to most people except those who are willing to put up with the dealbreakers
