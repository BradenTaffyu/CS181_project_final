2019 i enjoy gta5 quite a bit the singleplayer is fun the fivem servers can be really nice as well but this review isn t about those it s about the online aspect on rockstar s servers not any fivem server at all the online community is usually absolutely horrible either people using meta vehicles like the oppressors or using mods hacks to get what they want the online s community feels more like 1 good players 5 griefers 5 try hards and 89 hackers modders modders have far too much power in the game and rockstar does literally nothing about it no friends clan only lobbies to progress safely away from some modder who has the ability to lockup your controls crash your game and kill you with it claiming somebody else did it even worse things than just that the modders are the reason an entire discord server of 30 people stopped playing the game why we no longer care to actually progress and refuse to buy sharkcards when a modder can either just give you tons of money or reset your bank account and properties it makes me glad i got gta5 for like 5 because the modders don t make the game fun anymore all rockstar has to do to help entice at least some people to spend money on the game is alloy you to progress in friends clan lobbies even if it s at a small amount less like maybe 20 less income from anything unless there s more than maybe 8 people in the lobby if we get the ability to progress normally without being forced into public lobbies maybe than i ll give a positive review
