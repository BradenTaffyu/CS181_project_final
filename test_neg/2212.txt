2021 apex was a truly amazing game it helped me have an outlet as well as something to play with my best friend i had so much fun with it i made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins after 510 hours and a decent financial commitment and interest i wasn t able to play as things where getting busy with work in that time frame my ea account was hacked by someone not steam but ea the thing i m not using to play i m unsure of what that person did but whatever it was was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement despite the ea support seeing the suspicious login activity and acknowledging my account being hacked they still decided to stand by the ban so here i am 510 hours in and unless i want to spend 5 months going through legal issues this is the end of apex for me i m sure someone reading this would say i could just create another ea account but why would i invest any more of my time into a game where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens are punishing you for it ea will not get a single dollar from me ever again and i will pass the message anywhere i can overall don t buy this game and certainly don t spend any money on it cause it could be gone in an instant
