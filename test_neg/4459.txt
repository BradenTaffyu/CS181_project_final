2023 its a great game and a fun time sink which is hard to find these days my biggest issue with the game is the game support or lack of it the fact players can get a ban suspension for trading with other players is absolutely silly i received a 2 week suspension for selling someone some mods at the current market price of about 1500 platinum then i get an in game mail saying items removed from account after reaching out to support i was told the trade you did with the other player involved platinum that was obtained by fraudulent means so the platinum has been removed from your account but my items not returned at this time we have chosen to give you another chance at playing the game however we have placed a 2 week suspension on your account plus 2 months of not being able to trade with other players so now not only am i out those items but now my account is also in a negative platinum balance because of it so after my two week suspension i also have to pay the company money to make up for the negative balance on the account there is nothing in the eula or tos in regards to it being the players responsibility to make sure they are doing legitimate trades or to ensure who they are trading with are proper players this is on top of the bunch of people who received bans or suspensions from support as well for receiving gifts from people through their own market place
