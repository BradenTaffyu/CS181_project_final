2022 a gem of a game one of the best things i ve ever played no joke but the pc port is abysmal vsync is always turned on locking the game at 60fps stutters are everywhere no matter how beefy your hardware is i ve had 2 second stutters that made me die on a boss and to make matters worse they included easy anti cheat which makes it so that if you want to get a mod that fixes any of these issues you ll have to play offline and still risk getting banned either get it on console or wait for them to patch everything
