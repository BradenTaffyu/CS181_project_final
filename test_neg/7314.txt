after 120 hours the rose tinted glasses have shattered and i can safely say that this game is not good and i cannot recommend it in it s current state the base game s content is absolutely pathetic and the fact that the previous game in the series offered a more robust and complete experience even without dlc is a sham the fact that the performance hasn t been addressed or that it even was released in this state is inexcusable the combat balancing is truly a mystery to the greatest of scholars the fact that thief is the only class capable of teching the numerous knockdowns in this game unlike the previous game where every melee class was able to quickly stand up severely harms the pace of combat as unlike the previous game getting knocked down does not put you in a canned animation but rather a full ragdoll which i will admit is very entertaining at first but quickly becomes frustrating the nerf to all magick bolts for both mage and sorcerer severely limits their playstyles compared to the first game the enemy variety is somehow worse than the first game featuring only a few flavors of goblins or saurians in the overworld and very few new large monsters having been created in exchange for losing the hydra archhydra cockatrice evil eye the other two dragon variants wyvern wyrm we only gained minotaurs medusa who you likely will miss and the dullahan being one of the only fights in the game that i think is truly fantastic but unfortunately the dullahan so rarely spawns in that you could potentially go an entire playthrough without encountering one there is almost no incentive to actually fight anything at no point in the story is defeating a large monster mandatory save for the final boss which pales in comparison to the first game the unmoored world is a pathetic excuse for an endgame what it does do well with presentation is completely and utterly shattered in gameplay the everfall from the first game featured a diverse range of challenges all for the goal of collecting wakestones or simply preparing for the dlc meanwhile more time is spent walking in the unmoored world and the few new fights there are are simply repeated across each challenge all of which leads to an utterly anemic ending without even having the privilege of a satisfying final boss 4 10 this game is dead and the updates are too little and too late to revive it until an expansion comes
