product received for free wow 317 hours of playing and i really enjoyed the most part of them to be honest so why the heck am i giving this game a negativ recommendation simply because of the season system this game has so many great things to explore to discover and to fall in love with but it also has a great neckbreaker the current season system you re spending a month in order to level up to get the epic gear you ve aimed for in order to build your perfect home in order to tame your desired creatures during the current season you ve also spend hours in order to farm the needed and allowed ressources in order to completly rebuild your house just like they ve promised but than the season change occurs and the most important thing you ll get is a new unofficial title and name sisyphos you know that poor ancient greek king that treated on zeus and was forced to push the same stupid rocks upwards to the pitch only in order to watch them rolling back down and had to start all over again and again well welcome while walking in his shoes you ll get a total of 20k points in order to tranfers items from your last season to the new season things like weaponblueprints blueprintparts mods furniture formulars and so on will carry over for free but what doe s that actually mean nothing else that you have to start over again from the scratch in order to be allowed to use them again all things that you ve allready earned before within the game let me explain this a little bit more in detail you ve managed to really get 3 legendary weapons and a full set of of epic legendary armory during your season now you have 20k points available in order to transfer all these items and all the other stuff you own to the next season nice thing so far but transering only a single legendary weapon to the next season will cost you 10k of these points do the math 3 weapons 6 armorparts 10k each and you have a max of 20k also every other single ressource deviant and so on will cost you points to make it even more worse even if you carry over these items you won t be allowed to use them unless you ve leveled up again to lvl 40 50 same count s also for your weapon and armor blueprints you are not allowed to use and craft them unless you ve achieved the required level again so basically you re forced to waste a good part of your next season only in order to be allowed to use those things again that you ve allready earned it s getting even worse if you keep in mind how much ressources you ve allready spent in order to raise their calibration level cause don t forget if you carry that blueprint over manage to upgrade it via the wish machine it will have no affect on your current weapon you ll have to build and upgrade it again from the scratch same counts for armor parts same count s for housing and taming creatures you ve spend so many hours in order to get the things right the way you want them to be only in order to see that you are not able to carry them over par on par just like promised and you wanted to actually you are forced to play with a wannabee house untill you ve earned all those memetic shematics again wich you allready had in order to get your real house back so actually i still think that once human is a nice game worth of a shot by everyone during your first season of your personal gaming also i think that this game has great potential to last on the market as one of the best f2p survival games but as long as they are not willing to change the current season system or come up with alternative servers that allow you to carry over all of your achievements items level and so on this will be a very tough run for this game and i won t even speak bout the policy problematics we have to deal with here so after 317 hours of actually playing this game my conclusion is netease did a good job on presenting a new survival game as long as you are willing to accept all those strange policy agreements regarding personal information bout yourself and all the people you are connected with via facebook instagram discord and so on you ll get a very good game during the first season you participate in but right after that you are simply forced to waste hours and hours again only in order to be allowed to use equipment weapons armor and housing installations again that you have allready gained and earned so no matter how sorry i am bout it but i simply can t give this game a positive review right now i see the potential i see all the lovely work that has been put into details and i really appreaciate it but as of now it s literally a one season wonder cause many people will turn their back upon this game after the first or second season change the ve been forced to
