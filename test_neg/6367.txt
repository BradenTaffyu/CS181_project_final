2022 look the premise is interesting and so are the characters the game play loop itself is very fun but the ultimate failing of this game is the god awful balancing i have primarily spent my time playing killer and i can confidently say after 126 hours that you will only encounter about 5 fun games out of 100 i like the games where i feel like i am being challenged but i still have a chance if i play it well unfortunately this is not the case most of the time the matchmaking in this game is so terrible sometimes it will match you with people who have very clearly just bought the game and have no idea what they re doing this is not fun not for me as the killer stomping them to the ground and i can t imagine it being fun for the survivors either on the other end of the spectrum you will very often get matched with people who have dedicated their lives to this game i ve been matched with people who have played over 10k hours in this game and boy let me tell you it s not fun being stomped by good survivors either this leads me to another point toxicity this game has a massive issue with toxic players who will constantly t bag and emote at you to taunt you and then proceed to write ez in the end game chat sometimes they will even flame you for being bad completely disregarding that you have a fraction of the hours they have played i really wish i could recommend this game because the core fun is definitely there the developers just need to open their eyes and ears and finally listen to their community i am far from the only one who has these gripes with the game it s wide spread i don t know if i will be playing this going forward my life is too short for frustrating and unfun experiences i will listen in on the announcements coming on the 16th in hopes that the developers have finally decided to listen to their community from what i have heard from the community though i should not get my expectations up edit after 73 more hours so i got pretty good at killer too good it seems now all fun has been drained from the game entirely now i face people with meta perks bringing in toolboxes with brand new parts to just rush down the gens leaving me time to do absolutely nothing i haven t grinded out any of the gen regression perks so there is just straight up nothing i can do i decided today that i will quit this game for my own mental health it makes me more angry than it is worth i sincerely hope this review will help the game get better or at the very least help some people not try out this game if they re expecting a balanced experience
