i really like total war as a series but i won t buy anymore dlcs until the price point comes down they are not delivering on the quality of their dlcs anymore to meet the price point they are asking around 50 of the base cost of a standard full game for a dlc with 1 faction or a few more units and balancing that should be free anyway the new dlc s are still not worth the asking price maybe worth at 15 euro price range its price to quality and quantity is better now that the devs were mocked and shamed to make it better cause the community did not want to swallow their s t and yet still not worth the asking price at 25 euro per dlc dont get me wrong i like this game there s plenty of good things to enjoy and have fun but the resent business practices of the company has left a bad impression the price of the latest dlc being the prime issue its a mostly a fun game but the d m pricing
