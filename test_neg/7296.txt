an affront to long time players of dragon s dogma and dragon s dogma dark arisenas a long time player 12 years almost non stop and content creator for dragon s dogma dark arisen i was over the moon when dragon s dogma ii was announced the character creator was fun yet i was sorely disappointed that personality was tied so closely to voice i preferred having far more choices for my pawn than i was permitted here while i could mostly create the pawn i wanted the voice was off i slowly got used to it in game despite my misgivings it wasn t a game breaker for me i think the story web the developers and director itsuno chose to use is fatally flawed however through no fault of my own and unbeknownst to me a minor yet important npc died before i even arrived at his erstwhile spawn i eventually found him at the morgue revived him and he went back to the location he was supposed to be at however i can not complete the quest because all the enemies are dead and haven t respawned despite resting numerous times completing several side and main story quests and taking various routes and modes of transportation to his location he waves his hands about complaining about enemies that are not there so sad yes i understand the concept of ng and how wakestones work no i don t want to be babysat if an npc dies in battle under my watch then that s fair game if he just dies before i even get to the location though he is a minor npc that interacts with a major npc the very one the devs told us was extremely important and indeed is on the cover art i have read of others who have gone to the end game and an important npc who was needed to finish the story had died the player brought the npc back to life but now it just stands there a complete zombie thus the player can not progress the story to its inevitable conclusion this isn t the first quest that i have run into where there are so many filaments woven together that if one seemingly innocuous thread is snapped the whole cobweb unravels you gave us an beautiful open world but if we explore it we are punished this is not how dragon s dogma treated its hard core players in the past yes you might miss one quest but the rest of your adventure was unaffected by the small loss the game would move forward you still were given many choices for endings in other words you weren t screwed i hear people say there is always new game what kind of a choice is that it s simply unjust to lose everything i played for through no fault of my own because some dude in an office somewhere thought intertwining quests was the coolest thing ever i have found all sorts of great armor upgraded it dragonforged it became a maester in a couple of vocations and was working on finishing that up i am extremely happy with the combat it is fluid it is nice that pawn behavior is locked in place at least as far as i have been able to test that is great for some who never understood pawn behavior or never bothered to try to understand it in ddda those are the highlights it is 2024 why do i feel that i have stepped back in time past 2013 past 2012 4 skills no eternal ferrystone my pawn could be anybody s pawn in an effort to appease a certain vocal minority there isn t as much nuanced behavior other players are talking about metas for this game what that s what made the arisen and pawn system so much fun before anything was doable you could play what you wanted you didn t need the favor of some npc to become a maester warrior fighter magic archer you could dream big i cherished dragon s dogma dark arisen endured friends teasing when they saw me playing yet again built up my twitch and youtube channel on dogma material alone the game did a lot for me it brought me out of a dark place in my life and gave me almost all the interweb friends i know and care about deeply i will leave game performance out of it i do have a powerful machine but 8 10 fps in town while streaming is ridiculous that is post patch by the way overall 7 10combat 9 10 story 5 10 graphics tech 5 10
