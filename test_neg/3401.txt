2017 one of the best gaming experiences i have ever had absolutely loved the characters the story the humor the car radio the graphics and the gameplay however i m gonna have to give this a negative rating because of the fact that the multiplayer was dumbed down for the sake of microtransations which i despise there is nothing more i hate than and unethical business practices like this is the gaming scene i wanna thank the developers for making such an amazing game but you to the rest of the who did all this crap imo buy this game if you wanna enjoy a solo story but if you are planning to buy this game for the online multiplayer you are probably going to be a little disappointed it has become a pure grind and filled with annoying noob donors not to mention the incredible loading times and all the hackers
