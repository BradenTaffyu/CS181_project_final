2022 i don t usually care much for censorship but we are talking about paid skins those were sold in a way and then modified people bought the ultimate edition just for the matari outfit and it got changed i actually even think the matari one looks better now but the rest are just ugly patches with lower texture quality applied in front of characters on paid skins i ve bought several skins in this game and now i m afraid they ll get changed in the future with no warning whatsoever that s one way to make your playerbase not buy your cosmetics a shame because the game is really fun but this sucks
