2023 deleting games is wrong relist csgo there s absolutely no reason to stop people from having the option to play both csgo and cs2 i hope this being one of the worst reviewed valve games of all time helps this message to sink in and the solution is simple i d be more than excited to make this review positive if this decision is undone csgo is a critically important title to gaming history and should not just be deleted off the platform
