2023 i am what you may call a achievement hunter i have spent 200 hours of my time to get all 164 achievements in this godless game i was excited to continue this experience but on cs 2 but these basement dwelling valve low lives took my achievements away all my progress is now gone forever 200 hours are gone i could have taken 200 hours and applied them to getting a job finding friends or a wife or losing weight but now my fingers are crust with the decaying dust of these 3 day old cheetos i am pissed and cannot believe that i wasted my life
