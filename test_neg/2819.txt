2017 buyer be warned offline 9 10online 2 10online is an absolute joke the servers are full of hackers and cheaters that somehow get away with it for months on end yet i see honest players being banned because your servers are glitching them out or better yet actions caused by other players hackers are pushing out good loyal players it s sad that you re destroying your own customer base hopefully you read the reviews and value our input but thusfar we have seen nothing implemented to protect the honest players of this community i would say it has been too little too late and you have already lost a vast majority of your population the only version of this game that is actually enjoyable playable is the campaign
