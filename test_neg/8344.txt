2023 i believe that noita is probably one of the best games ever made if you don t value your time in order to get good enjoyment out of the game sacrificing time is required this starts to border on unreasonable when you need to spend hours getting out of the earlygame jail and a single mistake sends you back to the start if it gets better with all the ingame knowledge acquired this isn t known to me as i refuse to spoil myself to the game nor wish to bruteforce all the possible solutions for certain mechanics that time expended racks up extremely fast without either modding the game to make the conditions to learn things easier cheating the permadeath system by backing up your save or spoiling the game experience by using the community driven wiki additionally it sometimes doesn t feel like knowledge is truly power with certain bad starts i know it s a funny roguelike trope to just get bad starts dealt by the game but if you reach the fourth zone and get little resource it is usually faster to restart the run unless you just want a run w instead of trying to hunt secrets the gameplay is fun and when something clicks or you get actionable knowledge it is extremely satisfying such as basic alchemy for removing toxic sludge wand crafting likewise is fun basically a mini deckbuilder within the combat system the enemies are also quite good with the later ones acting as a soft deck check if you wish to explore the secrets of noita the time spent during progression however such as the abysmally slow earlygame is not you spend a high amount of time in churn imo noita would be significantly better as an rpg with how unforgiving the game can be the roguelike elements specifically permadeath and to a lesser extent the spell weighting system serve to be a deliberate pain point and causes a lot of start and stop if you hold no qualms about removing tedium or degrading the game experience by looking up resources this is a good game framework for the player to customize as they wish for context i haven t bothered killing the final boss a single time because i ve been more invested in exploring the game world i ve killed four of the world bosses so far i ve found out how to empower the voiceless key and found a handful of orb locations i don t consider myself far in
