2017 the game has gone into an absolute garbage state because of the action of take two i was wondering why we got a little hacking is not okay message when launching the game after a new update things all make sence now 75 euros for a good damm bike is not okay rockstar people already paid 60 euros to even get this game so why charge them more for the cool stuff that said this cool stuff is not in the single player you will have to go to the multiplayer and pour hundreds of hours into a very experience they keep giving us new ways to get overpowered cars but that cost around 25 euros to start working on there haven t been any new heists added to the game and the new cool stuff is only costing more and more i simpely don t enjoy this game anymore and i doubt most people do anymore heists are repetitive missions are straight up boring and a player who has this overpowered paid or hacked in content will simpely dominate a server don t buy this game if you want a good single player experience play the old gta games if you want a good multiplayer experience go play multi theft auto
