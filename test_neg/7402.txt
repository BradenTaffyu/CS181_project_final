psa no new game option after beating the game you have to manually delete your save to start over one save file combat is underwhelming from the company that made monster hunt enemies every 5 seconds coupled with boring combat ox cart gets attacked 9 10 times stun locked stun locked stun locked do i even need to mention the performance i didnt have much of an issue but then again my pc is worth between 3000 4000 dollars still fps drops in the city overall i would wait on a sale or at the very least wait until basic features new game is implemented
