dead by daylight is the most static and formulaic asymmetrical horror game on the market it s not a great game this is in part due to both the game itself not being very well put together and also the overarching community that works tirelessly to make this game a miserable experience the poor structure of dead by daylight can be seen in the common strategies that the community is forced to utilize in order to win seriously most of my experience in dbd has involved a killer that either 3 gens tunnels or slugs if they somehow aren t doing any of those 3 things they lose pretty quickly to make matters worse behaviour goes out of their way to make the problem worse and specifically makes killers that thrive in these strategies for example skull merchant was made to 3 gen needless to say the receiving end of these limited strategies is almost never fun but is it really the killers fault the game was designed in such a way that these players are forced to play like this if they want any chance of success simply put the game was designed horribly at a base level that s not to say that the community is completely innocent though unfortunately this game somehow fell into the hands of the hyper competitive crowd it should not be controversial for me to say that dead by daylight was obviously made to be a casual experience it is not a very competitive game at heart and it doesn t take much playtime to realize that for some incomprehensible reason the people that play this game treat it like a esport game you d find on the riot client and know the ins and outs of literally everything the ramifications of this can be seen in a casual player s attempt to play the game the mmr system is broken and you will never fully separate from this crowd these are individuals that have thousands of hours in this game and commit to everything in the most optimal manner due to their sheer abundance of knowledge to put it bluntly your entire experience in dead by daylight is going to be getting punished by knowledge checks unless you truly plan to sit down and learn every single thing about every little detail because these people sure as hell do whether intentionally or not they have forced a casual co op game one that doesn t even have a proper ranking system to gain the atmosphere of a f2p esport game aside from the forced competitiveness that this game certainly doesn t benefit from the community itself is just toxic i m not going to go into much depth because there isn t much to say survivors will form bully squads to xd troll the killer because they re so funny and awesome and are definitely loved irl killers will ruthlessly tunnel players because like i said before there s a minute set of ways to play this game they may even slug not even to utilize it as a strategy but just for the sake of holding everyone hostage additionally you will frequently run into streaks of afk killers that are literally deranking their accounts in an effort to dominate worse players it s a horrible group of people to play with what do you expect from a crowd that s basically only here to feed their ego going back to the game itself balancing seems to be a huge obstacle for the devs either everyone is using x perk killer whatever or noone is wanna know why this is it s a ramification of making this game competitive for no reason by having even a fraction of the playerbase play in the most optimal manner things become formulaic people don t play for fun anymore they re playing efficiently to grind that sweet artificial ranking system a system that isn t even based on skill and more so on playtime so wtf is the point every match is the same handful of killers everyone is using the same exact perks playing in the same exact way it feels corporate soulless and boring dead hard is the best perk nerf it into the ground now it s useless everyone moves on to the next big perk that gains a 60 pickrate and the process never ends you can really look at this both ways either you must play this way because the devs have balanced the game horribly and there s no other way to survive or because the community normalizes such a system and you are forced to adapt to survive it s probably both fun is foreign to a community that would rather seek self fulfillment from a largely noncompetitive co op game viewing this game in a broader sense the cosmetics suck i feel like there are only a few good skin drops in dozens that take place over the year this game is obsessed with making conventionally unattractive cosmetics and characters around the clock i have no idea who benefits from this or what the motives are to be fair this isn t always the case and especially recently this has been largely untrue the ui has continuously degraded itself over the years and idk who tf they let cook it s really unintuitive now the game s technical side progresses at a very slow pace and for the longest time this game was locked at 60fps which is embarrassing the graphics are beginning to age poorly imo visually this game is starting to become outdated these are the least of its problems though essentially dead by daylight is an awful experience due to an incompetent dev that makes horrible changes a nonfunctional matchmaking system and a base structure that lacks the substance to make itself versatile enough this is all while being topped off with a community that craves self fulfillment in their life by forcing a fun co op game with friends to turn into a competitive esport simultaneously lashing out at the players around them will i keep playing this game probably it s fun with friends albeit that isn t a genuine positive in my eyes everything is fun with friends it doesn t change the fact that this is a game where those who feel insecure about their lives and desperately need reaffirmation that they re good at something come to spend thousands of hours and knowledge check everyone around them for fake accomplishment this game was never intended to be as competitive as people make it out to be and it s led to the degradation of a game that had a lot more potential
