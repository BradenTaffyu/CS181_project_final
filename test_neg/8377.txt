2022 this game has so much potential but ends up being incredibly annoying in a death by 1000 cuts way 1 the game leaves single pixels around and you collide with them i ve taken so much damage from getting stuck on one little dot spotting pixels is not a skill i want tested 2 tiny amounts of liquid are enough to apply damage over time to you but sometimes it doesn t this behavior is frustrating and makes deciding on safe positions quite difficult i want to be able to know if a surface is safe to stand on at a glance 3 the foreground and background can share colors and can be poorly differentiated this results is hitting things you didn t think you would and not hitting things you thought you should 4 enemies can attack you from off screen with no possible way of knowing they are there in advance this is genuinely bad design that is fixed on the sniper with a laser sight other enemies should also have attack tells when off screen 5 enemies have perfect aim including accounting for velocity this is even worse when they have homing projectiles making dodging difficult if not impossible the only solution is to burst the enemies down 6 there is very little healing in the game this means that all those small amounts of damage you take add up over time slowly wearing you down throughout a level until you make it to the full heal at the end i ve been playing nethack for 20 years i love taking advantage of details to win a fight but that is a turn based game i can take as much time to examine everything as a wish noita is real time but has a similar level of information density and my brain just can t keep up i can play the way i want which is run and gun and i will never make it past the second floor if i am cautious i can make it much farther but that makes a run take a very long time exhausting and frustrating me by the end i love the terrain system and wand system so very much but the game built around them does its best to wear you down which is not a satisfying experience
