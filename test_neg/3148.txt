rockstar support have denied my tickets again and again over the years my rockstar account was linked to a mail of a company who deleted their mailing services and now i have no way to get a real human to read the requests i make over the years all i get is bots pretanding to be humans fully ignoring all the evidence i have about the fact that im the owner of these games what an evil company lol
