2022 i wish there was a neutral recommendation but whatever the game up to lyndell is awesome but then the quality of the game drops substantially recycled unbalanced enemies and reused dungeon designs for example the open world has beatiful landscapes but there is not much incentive at story level to go through the dungeons or the loot is bad if you are not caster also fs should have improved the gameplay like they do with bloodborne or sekiro but they choose to keep the old school ds movesets the thing is that the enemies attacks were improved lol i m looking at you malenia anyway 6 5 10 for me a really really good game but with serious flaws some of them from previous games like the camera against giant enemies
