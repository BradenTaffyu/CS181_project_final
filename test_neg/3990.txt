2019 i swore off purchasing rockstar games after they replaced my pc copy of san andreas with a crappy mobile port now years later i relent and purchase gta5 after several friends play and keep asking me to join in i had a lot of fun and remembered why these games are such a blast now 3 weeks later i m forced to be online to even play single player with a new and forced drm now with this new launcher i cannot launch straight into online i have to load then go to online and then i m in a never ending loading screen every time what the thanks for nothing r edit now i cannot run the game without running as admin because it launches the new launcher which then wants me to hit play on steam and when that is done it tries to launch it through steam causing it to error saying the game is already running so now i have to run steam as admin gta5 as admin r launcher as admin and discord as admin this is getting beyond stupid edit 2 friends dragged me in loading issues seem fixed though i hate having yet another forced launcher thanks for the fix at least
