2023 the game is in a sorry state each new patch introduces new bugs some of their supposed fixes and new content in the patch notes don t even work or are not even in the game developers are completely radio silent as well on top of all this they have the nerve to charge 25 for a small dlc when they won t even fix the base game total war just is not worth your money
