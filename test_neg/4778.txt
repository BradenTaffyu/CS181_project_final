okay so usually i dont leave in depth reviews but for this game i really feel the need to i am late to the cod game played a little growing up but never got into it until mw3 so this review is only coming from someone who is new to it after 200 hours i honestly loved playing with friends especially multiplayer but recently have gotten more into zombies i really liked the open world grindy feel of this zombies never really had any issues with crashing or lagging until recent about a week ago they put out an update for the game which was for season 3 reloaded and i have crashed in zombies now 7 times since then full freeze and crash to desktop let me also mention that it isnt just happening to me twice now the entire server and players have crashed and lost everything as well as some party mates of ours who have also crashed since happening multiple of us have tried reinstalling the game changing our settings and priority nothing has worked 7 10 times we have gone into zombies full on crashed and lost everything and this game does not have a single backup plan for crashing mid game so you do not get to get anything back i have tried to check reddit and twitter for answers as well as ing them on twitter but nothing seems to help unless you want an answer from a bot i personally do not have experience with prior cod games but from my experience recently this is such a lazy put together of a game i spent 150 on this game for 3 of us to play as well as spending hundreds for skins in the game as well it really seems like a waste of money for the lack of effort they seem to have for this game anymore especially coming out with a new game every single damn year if you are going to scam your players out of a 70 game every year i would expect at least a little effort to keep your servers running and keep your players happy that being said most companies and games nowadays are just another money grab which it seems this game is also turning into sad to see i recommend for multiplayer but unfortunately the game has quite literally forced me to not be able to play zombies until they work on their game
