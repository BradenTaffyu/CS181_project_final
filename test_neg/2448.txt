the game is now dominated by 3 stack streamers playing this game for money casual play is gone new players wont have a chance to even learn the game i have been playing since launch and it is very sad what this game has turned into respawn continues to ignore casual player feedback and instead listens to the pro players who whine and complain about very stupid things everyone on controller continues to script and superglide around great job respawn u fail
