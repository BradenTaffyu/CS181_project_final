2015 take2 took down the modding team which was developing on gta mp it was a mod that wanted to bring a dedicated server with feautures similar to samp this was a grandious idea and it would have been the only way to get people to buy this game for a longer periode the game is dieing slowly and with no player its even less fun than it s alread is it has no fun factor rockstar decides which features end up in the game and which not the roleplay in samp or mta had a enourmous count of players when done right rockstar could have cooperated with the mod creators and sold mod game for 10 on steam but they sleeped as they do now they could sell server licenses like ea does for their games but for them its only important to make money until they can bring out the next dlc or next title don t buy the game in the hope to get an awesome multiplayer experience you only get 11 year old kids that only played cod before you know what that means they dont let people develope an alternate multiplayer mods but they dont care about the hack creeaters petition buy the games we enjoy them we love videogames but the businessmen just don t care about us let s react together
