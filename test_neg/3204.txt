2015 such a beautiful game a game of such depth and scale it overwhelms ones mind to even attempt to think of the development complexities involved one that is the product of years of slowly but surely tweaking and refining the wildly successful gta open world formula it once again pushes the envelope of what an open world game can and should be all to be ruined by hackers rockstar you should be embarassed by your blatant failure at even pretending to handle the hacking epidemic that is the gta 5 multiplayer they are everywhere do something about this and i ll edit my review to positive a company that devotes almost two additional years of development to a pc port obviously cares about the platform so please do not abandon us now clean up the hackers update well over a year later and rockstar continues to ignore the problem and ban legitimate players again stop calling them mods and modders if you are referring to playing the single player by yourself and altering the game then yes that term is correct however in multiplayer running a program that directly effects and disturbs the gameplay for all users in a multiplayer environment is not a mod it is a cheat exploit hack mods are meant to alter or improve a single person s experience customize skins and textures add features to the game that the devs didn t think about etc they are not meant to disrupt online players and their experience that is called cheating calling them modders makes it sound less insidious and more innocent then what is happening in this game a single hacker cheater exploite will quickly demolish a server or fill everyone with cash so they get banned blindly by rockstar immediately the joy of playing such a brilliantly crafted game with your friends and strangers alike goes right out the window calling what people do in this game a mod when referring to the multiplayer game would be the equivilant to calling a counter strike aim bot or wall hack a mod the reason it is not is because it gives a single player a distinct and completely overpowered advantage against others in a sandbox environment where everybody is supposed to have a chance to work their way up so a year and a half later and rockstar doesn t give a damn i ve been a life long rockstar customer but if they don t get this together by gta6 then rockstar will never see another dime of my money ever
