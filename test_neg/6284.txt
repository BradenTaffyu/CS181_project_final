2022 survivor based game with perk reliant killers if you aren t using the top 5 killers there is such a huge difference and divide between good and bad perks in this game which just encourages players to perform and play in the most scummy way possible bhvr seems to have a horrible time in balancing anything because they only listen to survivors opinions why do maps like cowshed and mothers dwelling exist why do they balancing every perk around the top 3 killers why do all the killer mains leave the game it s because they only listen to survivors opinions most maps are ridiculously survivor friendly and when you finally outplay a survivor they will just use dh oh the game is going south so the killer makes a strategic decision to kill someone quickly bt into dh into ds into pallet stun don t wanna eat the ds oh don t worry just slug them and they will use unb anytime the killer wins it s just a hurl of insults towards the killer from slurs to death threats survivors always cry about how they didn t have a fun time if when they lose while saying some of the most obscene and stupid things through a very poorly made censorship system they will never consider a killers fun and feelings so why should a killer consider survivors fun survivors will 4 man stack swf while all bring bnp nothing wrong with this play style and get annoyed when the killer rushes their objective to kill them it s constant irony honestly maybe if the toxicity wasn t so high the game would be much more tolerable not fun tolerable due to the fact that killers are leaving the survivor solo queues are overwhelmingly long once you ve finally entered a match to then be immediately tunnelled camped and killed it ruins the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth there s nothing wrong with this play style but when the games are shorter than the queues survivors never get a chance to learn play and as a result become toxic and short tempered i can t imagine the experience of a poor 40 year old father that comes home and finally has 40 minutes to spare and decides to boot up dbd to be welcomed with 20 minute queue times 5 minute matches same 3 killers and stagnant meta builds on everyone
