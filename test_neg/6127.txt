2016 positivesgreat game really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play there are unlockables like perks offerings clothes items addons etc you can level up your characters as well as your rank for both survivor and killer you can also play private matches with your friends and you won t lose anything if you do die as a survivor the ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now you collect these crystals at least they look like crystals called pips according to the official dead by daylight manual and when you collect a certain amount in a row you get promoted the lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1 to get from rank 20 19 you must collect 3 pips from rank 12 and onwards you must collect 5 pips each rank down meaning rank 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to rank 1 for both survivor and killer so the game seems cool right well most games aren t that perfect tldr great game fun lost of unlockables makes you want to continue playing private matches ranking system collect pips to rank up rank 20 lowest rank rank 1 highest rank negativesthe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently cannot invite your friends to public matches only private matches and some players just boost each other for example one person plays as the killer hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor and they troll you there are many disadvantages in the game too such as the host of every game is the killer this is bad because almost every killer in the game has a isp everybody is searching for their friends and sometimes it can take a while to find a game the longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason you will lag in almost every game you will rage you will die in stupid ways you will get stuck in objects there are hackers in this game too now it s time to elaborate on these points the killer being the host of every game really annoys me just because it gives them a huge advantage think of it like this the host controls everything and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff but the host has internet and because he controls everything it affects you and your friends way more than it does for him as a matter of fact it doesn t affect him at all lag will ruin you and make you rage i ve lost many games just because of lag but how does the lag affect you in game well when you attempt to vault over something like a wall or object and you re lagging you are going to die especially if the killer s chasing you because what happens is that rather than vaulting your character freezes lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed this is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways you will also get stuck in objects one time i spawned into a game the developers call these trials and i was repairing a generator then the killer was coming towards me and i was thinking oh no problem i will just hide behind this tree so i go behind this tree and crouch and he walks past me yeh i m all good i think to myself then i go to walk away from the tree and then just like that i was stuck i literally couldn t move and the murderer was coming back he walked past me again and didn t see me although he didn t see me i was still very angry because i wasn t going to be able to survive unless i get him to kill me so i just quit and also got demoted and lost my item this is why the killer has such a huge advantage in the game this also isn t the only object i ve gotten stuck into i have recorded games i ve played where my connection with the killer was very bad and i will perhaps upload them soon to my steam profile youtube channel link on profile so be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what i m talking about last but not least hackers yes there are hackers already and the game was only recently released even with an anti cheat this just really confuses me as to why their anti cheat software hasn t even banned these players yet i saw a player who had prestiged his claudette morel to level 1000 which at this stage is an impossible stage to even be on most players almost all haven t even prestiged including myself tldr game has more negatives than positives conclusionso to conclude my review this game needs more development the game is great and fun but when you take the negatives into account dead by daylight isn t really the best game to buy at this time i believe the developers didn t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date but the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games so to say they should be adding more patches as well but in the meantime i recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through thank you for reading my review
