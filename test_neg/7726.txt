2021 i love the scenery the music the quests and the gameplay however this game force you to pvp which make you unable to enjoy those there isnt any mechanic to protect new player baby pirates who cant handle a gun against those kraken hunter legendary pirate etc etc and the community is so toxic they will kill you on sight even you show reluctant to fight back i stopped playing previously after felt sick of the environment coming back for the interesting gameplay also want to see whats in the update feel like quitting again after being drowned a few times yeah you may say i lack the skill to properly play this game as if pvp is the only element in this game finding treasure solving riddle pff this game has so much potential and it is a shame that the force pvp mechanic draw back alot of new comer you can easily develop a mechanic to protect newbies or players who just want to sail peacefully am fine with getting lesser rewards and make higher reward for dangerous route pvp allowed but such a shame developer dont care about peaceful player like you already made arena mode for those bloodthirsty mofos why dont you also cater those who just want to play peacefully until then wouldnt recommend this unless you love pvp bullying and most importantly you have another 3 friends to play with you solo or duo its a shipwreck simulator for you
