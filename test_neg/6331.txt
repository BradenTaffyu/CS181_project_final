2021 i say this wholeheartedly do not play this game if you re someone with an addictive personality or someone who in general struggles with mental health if you cannot maintain your cool this game is going to be agonizing for you at least if you plan on playing killer primarily similar to league of legends this is a game designed to ensnare you drag you into a toxic feedback loop of endorphins and depression and keep you hooked so you spend more and more money on skins and killers this game is objectively pay to win you either grind for 35 hours for one character then grind another 6 12 hours for their perks all to use them on another character so you can tailor the experience to your liking or you fork over 5 dollars for a character just to grind 6 12 hours on their perks pair this with an uber toxic community and a gameplay structure designed so that the role of the killer the role with theoretically more power is stressful and anxiety inducing this is a game best avoided or if you like league of legends and and ball torture it s a 10 10
