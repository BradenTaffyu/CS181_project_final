2016 the singleplayer is excellent as well as the multiplayer portion of the game when you are playing with friends doing jobs and heists and having a fun time messing around in the open world of los santos everything else is a freaking mess if the grind doesn t get you then be prepared to meet the community one side are the legit hackers that ruin the game with their god mode and one shot everything in their path with merely peashooters on another side will be griefers that will do anything to give you a bad day in a public lobby one another side would be the actual community whose toxicity is worse than the kids on either the cod or bf community that fondles r s balls and blindly believes that all legit players that were falsely banned are hackers there is no way to reason with them even though there is hard proof a word of advice either do a private lobby or grab some friends or trusted people heh as if that would apply to the majority of the gta o community
