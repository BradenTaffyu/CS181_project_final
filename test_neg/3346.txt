2023 surprisingly i never reviewed this game so here we go years ago i would have recommended this game but years have past and the rockstar i knew and loved is dead gone are the days of san andrea s and vice city rockstar sold out rockstar censored their games rockstar refuses to innovate or maintain the gta experience this game was fun at first and gta online was ahead of it s time but not anymore it s just filled with micro transactions want a new car micro transaction want a property micro transaction want to play the new update micro transaction want to play the game normally without spending money guess what hours of work will be lost after a child with mommy s credit card buys an oppressor and blows up supplies that you are trying to sale because you enjoy the game and want to actually play it point is this game forces you to buy things to make the game enjoyable i played this game by grinding for a long time but rockstar intentionally limits how much money you can make online on purpose so you will buy their in game currency it s just a giant online vending machine that s the game why make a story why continue the campaign and why release dlc when you can just put more micro transactions in the multiplayer the campaign was enjoyable and funny i grew to like the character progression and missions but after you beat the campaign there is no real reason to play it and while yes you can mod it the reality is why why is it always up to us to make the games better just to have our mods become features in the next installments or worse be banned because mods make a superior product it s just sad how far gta has fallen in my opinion it s no different than other games like fallout 76 they don t release any content except their version of content and it s always the in game store or micro transactions if you want to waste a lot of money on things that could just be modded in if the game had mod support and servers on rockstar s behalf then by all means buy it i don t want to play it anymore
