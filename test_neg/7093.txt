2016 i have played black ops 2 for a long time and i have never been this disappointed with a transition from old game to new game in my life it s hard to see why anyone would play this as wall running and sliding has ruined the entire game call of duty has never been a game where you are safe anywhere but it has progressively gotten worse with the new acrobatic features the map is more flexible than ever before this can be good and bad in my opinion wall running sliding and double jumping isn t that great when you jump around yourself it s alright but not great however when an enemy jumps around like a damn monkey it s impossible to shoot them like i said you aren t safe anywhere it s not just camping that you aren t able to be doing anymore not that being able to camp was good it s also being anywhere at all in the nuketown the houses aren t even remotely safe as an enemy can easily jump into the house from any direction these acrobatic abilities also makes it impsssible to kill someone with a grenade they can simply slide away and avoid the grenade easily the game has the same problem a lot of the call of duty games have in common using the larger gund like light machine guns are a disadvantage in combat the submachine guns are so much more useful i can t really say a lot about this feature since i m not in a very high level apparently being good at bo2 does not make you any good at bo3 but i also dislike the specialists in the game it s great that you are able to customize your looks but the abilities the specialists possess are not very great they seem just like perks only for a limited time or normal guns for that matter ruin i m officially done with call of duty screw this i m going back to battlefield
