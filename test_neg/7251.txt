i m liking the game a lot honestly but there are a couple outrageous things that stop me for giving it a thumbs up the extremely silly microtransactions cheat codes all of those items can be get fairly easy in the game so please don t buy any i really rather for them to remove them because is scaring a lot of people away from trying the game the game performance is really iffy no matter if i maxed out or put my graphics at bare minumum the frames stay the exact same as a note i have an rtx3060 which never given me any issues with current gen games denuvo if you reinstall the game in too many devices say goodbye to play this thing likely part of the reason of the poor performance basically maleware
