2022 a recent steam update in may of 2022 affected some dlc heavy games in how often they ping the steam servers to check for dlc this game is affected to the point where people are getting huge frame drops every few seconds there is a topic on the front page of this game s discussion board outlining specifics of the issue with hundreds of responses complaining that the issue hasn t been fixed yet there are currently only three solutions 1 launch the game offline and don t connect to the internet this completely fixes the stuttering 2 revert steam to a prior build and play it on that however you still won t be able to play the game online 3 oddly enough apparently installing a mod menu spoofs all the dlc into your game and makes it so that the game won t repeatedly ping to check for dlc this completely fixes the stuttering unfortunately it can cause issues when trying to play with mods and of course it risks a vac ban and really we shouldn t be expected to use some shady dll cheating file from a discord link just to play online normally i think it s unacceptable on valve s and or activision s part that players did all the legwork in documenting the issue and what causes it and have submitted many support tickets yet this remains a widespread issue two months later i just want to play zombies with my friends without lagging every few seconds tl dr this is a great game which i ve had so much fun with over the years but don t buy it right now i ll change my review to a thumbs up if when the issue ever gets fixed
