2017 the eagle that hears the whistle of an arrow piercing its heart sees that the arrow s feathers are made of its own feathers the reasoning of the characters and the amazing irony of the developers actions on their brainchild the game has lost its value the online world has been clogged with unnecessary dlc and with exorbitant in game prices of course the game needs to pay off with shark card donations and i m not even talking about anti cheat they ban all the innocent and the cheaters are thriving bravo rockstar the game has turned into a kind of all points bulletin for only 50 and why is it necessary if i had written a review for the game in 2015 it would have been positive but it s good that i decided to write it now there was a lot of hope for a revolution in the open world action genre but in the end we got party poop it s only good for its single player mode but the online is ruined
