2023 mw3 is the worst campaign i ve ever played in a cod enemy bullet sponges and the open levels are horribly done with you having to use stealth or else face wave after wave of enemies even if you kill them all in stealth they just keep coming creating situations where it s easier to just rush to the objectives and then get out and not use any kind of strategy also the levels themselves aren t interesting at all with no memorable set pieces that stand out in any meaningful way nothing to say for multiplayer as it s just cod you know what your e getting with that
