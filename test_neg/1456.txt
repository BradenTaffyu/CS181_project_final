2023 i bought all the dlcs for warhammer ii and all of the dlcs for warhammer iii except for the most recent one warhammer was their golden goose that printed money for them and i spent hundreds of dollars on their games and dlcs then creative assembly blew 100 million dollars developing a game that got cancelled before it could be released and now they expect warhammer fans to pay for it by hiking dlc prices significantly when i complained about it on the steam forums they banned me along with hundreds of other loyal fans who bought their games so i m going to write my first review ever i m not going to support this company anymore their ceos have some sort of weird god complex thing where they think they can control negative criticism by banning people on steam forums or making fake copyright claims on youtubers who criticize them if you re curious check out volound on youtube
