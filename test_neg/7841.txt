2023 i really wanted to like this game but i find it too stressful to play solo and my friends don t like the toxic players i really do wish there was a peaceful or lightweight server for those of us who don t like full time pvp for people like me that would not ruin the game honestly i wish i could just get my money back for the game and the character change i didn t know was permanent i would recommend others avoid this game if you don t love all of these 1 paid exclusive skins 2 toxic competitiveness 3 high risk moderate reward 4 constant pvp
