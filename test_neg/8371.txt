2023 i obsessively played this game in mid 2020 and came back to it today on a whim i was in a safe zone when a randomly spawned worm broke something causing the game to blame me for angering the gods and spawn an uber powerful skeleton to eliminate me challenge is one thing but i had absolutely no control over that outcome that run i guess might as well just kill my character at spawn to save me the trouble even ignoring that blatant issue noita requires me to gamble wayyyy too much time on the vague hope that i ll get a good run and finally re experience the game s incredible highs you ll never see most of the awesome spells and cracked out wands visible in the trailers because you ll be too busy getting stunned by random bullets plummeting 1 000 feet and landing on some explosive barrels that coincidentally happen to be on fire when noita is good it s really good those moments don t come around frequently enough though and i just don t have the patience to dump any more hours into a bunch of junk runs before i can experience another great one
