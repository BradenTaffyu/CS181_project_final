i would be careful about this game i love it dont get me wrong but i find myself on a negative side of things after switching my character to the new scenario i found that after a bit i had a negative currency amount for my paid currency i write to find out what happened and they tell me game support botapp today at 11 03 amwe found that after the payment interoperability for multiple characters under the same account function was updated on august 15 when your character entered the eternal island some paid assets were double calculated resulting in the return of excess star sources including home recipes excluding plates avatars avatar frames business cards and business card backgrounds the problem has been fixed online according to our backend inspection your account has this situation from a fair perspective we need to deduct the excess star sources from your account we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience caused to you if you have any further questions please feel free to contact us we look forward to your evaluation of our services and thank you for your support have a nice day what does this even mean first off i dont have multiple characters i have bought house stuff but again i put the money in for every single thing i got because money is tight i been asking them for a break down because not only did they give me a negative amount but they took everything i had that was positive left in there i never gotten more then what i paid for and if some assets were double charged shouldnt they owe me money i know good and well i never bought currency and gotten twice as much as i was supposed to get i never gotten anything more then what they were supposed to give me prove to me with a break down what happened dont just give me a negative currency and say i owe this much like i am stupid and dont know how to do math right so a small update 8 22 that reply is the generic reply you get about the situation any mention about it and it is cut and paste no further talking or explanation my experience with the game is positive for the most part but this along with some other lingering problems just leaves me with a negative review they wont explain anything but they have not banded me from the game because of the issue looking more into it though sounds like it was completely on their end of things like if you all mess up you bite the bullet you dont make your loyal and paying customer suffer for it not that what they said happened even happened they have yet to prove that to me because i sat down and post all the numbers to them to no reply except the big paragraph above and i am not paying real money to fix the problem they created hopefully this doesnt make me quit in the long run but as my friend buy stuff and enjoy new things i am left with this bitter taste in my mouth thanks for nothing game
