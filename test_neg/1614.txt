i enjoy the franchise i find it really enjoyable tww2 i have 1 500 hours logged in this one i have over 500 hours at time of review i can not recommend the game as it stands they need to get the dlc content up to par if the price they need is 25 which they have said they would but until that is shown through actions i would stay away if new to the game i also really dislike the following quote the right to discuss is a privilege it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game creative assembly 2023until they get company values to be more customer service oriented just stay away its quite bad right now will update to a positive review if i feel they have won me back as a fan of the company
