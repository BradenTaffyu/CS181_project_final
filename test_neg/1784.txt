2023 the bug report list on their internal jira is probably longer than all the recent negative reviews here no wonder if you only do a handful of fixes with the release of a new dlc and nothing in between i guess time is scarce and doesn t leave room for bug fixes when you spend all your available time to come up with how much more you could possibly charge for the next dlc who knows what new bugs will be introduced with the new dlc that will never be fixed and make the game not only more expensive but also worse
