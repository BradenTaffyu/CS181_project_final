2021 i have tried i really have i have given myself some time before putting this review but i have to as the game stands now i can not recommend it this comes from the community and not the game i have been unable to do any of the tall tales the story of the game because i keep getting killed telling people i am just doing story nope making sure my ship is empty at all times even emptying the barrels of cannonballs and stuff and telling them that nope trying to reload to different areas nope the game is not fun when all you want to do is learn the story behind to enjoy the game without asshats the game needs a server where you can see the story maybe learn pve instead of nothing but people finding it funny to continually hunt you down and shoot you to prevent you from doing the story its boring anyway this is sad because i want to enjoy it but i am not so good at pvp games and without having anything to make me want to play because of how the community is maybe i will try again in a few years once it dies down
