2018 after todays new game update you guys said original story i feared gta online would die a slow death with the arrival of red dead redemption 2 s multiplayer mode on consoles but it doesn t look like that s going to be the case just yet just no gta online died when you morons decided to make it p2p peer to peer connection instead of dedicated servers where anyone can use mods and cheats without consequences you literally have around 10 20 of the people using mods who just mess with you when you try to do missions putting you in cages killing you over and over again with their godlike teleportation mode on etc i would have bought in game money for real money if it wasn t for the cheaters why would i spend one dollar more on this game where other players can just download cheats and give themselves infinite money gta online could have been one of the biggest if not the biggest online game if your management weren t absolutey morons happy you guys never became as big as fortnite you idiots don t deserve it at all edit to make things clear i hate fortnite lol i ve tried it twice uninstalled both times within 30 minutes you can go check twitch movies shows everyone is streaming talking about fortnite never said it was a good game but at least they try and they put out a lot of content and deal with cheaters which is why they ve had big success you can t argue against their success no matter what you think of their game rockstar pretends like nothing while so many cheaters are running rampart ruining everyones experience real shame because i really loved the game itself but i m tired of cheaters messing with you for no reason just for the attention because their life have no meaning and no one cares about them in real life
