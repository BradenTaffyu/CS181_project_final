2017 i m at the point where i am doubting i ll ever open this piece of game again i ve played for 145 hours i really enjoyed the game at some point but it s just insanely cancer here s why the ranking systemthere is literally no way for you to play a new character that you haven t tried before without ruining your rank that you ve slowly built up with the killer survivor you re used to that s because the game uses the same rank for all the killers you play and for all the survivors as well there isn t a single game mode where you play against strangers and you re not ranked there s no casual mode or anything like that if you dare to try a new character when you re anywhere below level 20 you re gonna throw your mouse against the wall the survivors will troll the out of you will use insanely strong items trinkets or will just be in favor because you don t have any perks to begin with which probably has something to do with the amazing matchmaking as well that leads me to the next point it is possible to play the game for the first time and get matched up with at least one counterplayer that has a major level advantage over you there is no machmaking whatsoever it seems to me that the game just matches people randomly and hopes for the best also the game doesn t have any penalty or limitations when it comes to premades you can play the killer and end up with 4 premades 2 of them with items that allow them to fix generatores in less than 1 minute each and the 2 others with flashlights which emit stronger lights than the sun itself and make you drop the survivors you manage to catch or health packs which let them heal themselves easily but there s so much more body blocking pallet looping etc long story short there s absolutely no penalty for premades even though they have an insane advantage over you they don t even get less points for winning like that and if despite of all of that you manage to catch a survivor for 3 devastating times implying that you don t camp the hook those amazing pros that have flashlights pallet loop to infinity and body block and or bm you don t give you the pleasure of actually killing them and make some points for once instead they decide to disconnect again with no immediate penalty whatsoever they don t get any points from that round and may decline in rank but they get to keep their insanely good items that made it so hard for you in the first place and they can just start another match right after sabotaging yours witout any delay without any extra q time nothing and the best thing is you as a killer get less points as well if someone that you wanted to kill just disconnects if you don t manage to kill a single person as a killer you de rank no matter how many times you hit all of them no matter how many times they were on the hook or on the ground the game needs a sacrifice to reward you and that s what so many survivors love to abuse i know i m speaking mostly from the killer s point of view but this is where it s most apparent now if you actually go survivor and try to have a good time the problem starts with finding a lobby my girlfriend who has quite a good rank has to wait a mininum of 4 or 5 minutes for finding a game as a solo player and if she s especially lucky she ll hit a lobby where the killer will just disconnect as a consequence of seeing the survivors in the lobby having flashlights or repairing tools equiped the fact that it s so hard to start a game as a survivor premade or not just shows how tired most killers are of chasing a survivor around in a circle for 3 minutes only to be flashlighted and lose the game later on another consequence is the insane camping it can happen that you as a survivor get hooked by the killer and he will literally stand in front of you not leaving you out of his sight for a second they camp the hell out of the hooks because they know how easy it is for your teammates to save you thanks to various perks and that you can get away even if they manage to hit you yet again when you re already wounded if the survivor that unhooks you has the perk called borrow time i m only mentioning this because yet again perks can be stacked 4 times not just items so if multiple survivors have that perk it will be harder to bring them down on the ground than a eagle on crack it seems to me that because the devs have no clue how to intervene there s a cycle of each other off and ruining the fun for everyone it s insanely hard to find a lobby as a survivor because killers dodge lobbieskillers dodge lobbies because survivors play like cancer and use the worst itemssurvivors that are hooked get camped a lotkillers that leave survivors alone for a second to actually search the map get trolled the out of them for playing fairetc there s no balance no fairplay no punishment for the ones that ruin the fun and after many many hours of ignoring this i ve reached a point where i need to drink bleach and leave this world forever after finishing this review don t buy or if you do only do so for fun not to actually play competitively
