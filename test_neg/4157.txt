2017 though i never got around to modding this game i am very annoyed at take two for that up for me so now i pretty much can t this is one of those games like skyrim fallout 4 and many others where its a perfect playground for modding quite annoyed that my 60 no longer gets me a moddable singleplayer which you the singleplayer is my game and i will play it the why i want to play it just a micro transaction laden multiplayer and singleplayer with characters
