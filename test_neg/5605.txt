2020 its a good game but the most ridiculous f toxic community ever never seen anything worse only toxic people who think they are good die first and on the last team member who dies only if you can stand people like that i would recommend this game graphics are good gameplay is nice and only if you play with a full non toxic squad its overall a great experience ubisoft needs to take all those toxic people and place them in matches with same sort of players like the bad sport system in gta online that would make the game so much more enjoyable
