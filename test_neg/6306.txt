2021 this game has always had its fair share of struggles when i started playing back in january 2019 at the time i had a different account i am now at a combined 2k hours of play and am at a point where i can t stay silent anymore from gamebreaking bugs to insane balance disrepancies dbd has never been good but it used to be fun this is no longer the case and i highly recommend you look elsewhere possibly vhs and or identity v for a fun asymmetrical horror experience so what has changed after the latest patch all you ll run into is hackers especially at high mmr they re not subtle about it either literally blinding you for the entire game or escaping once you spawn into the map sending in footage of these hackers doesnt do anything reporting doesnt do anything bhvr refuses to respond the mmr system judges you based on your escape rating which killers can deny for you specifically without you being able to do anything about it for killers mmr judges you based on kills not on gen pressure not on how fast you end chases but just kills which once again is not an accurate rating of skill money pumped into the game was then put towards a lincensing deal with boss protocol for the pinhead dlc and its resulting nfts which was then endorsed and supported on their public twitter dead by daylight is knowingly promoting a money laundering and environmentally damaging scam that steam has openly denounced and therefore should not even be on the platform alongside this the community itself is such a toxic cesspool that even in the forums or discord servers without so much as touching the game you ll find yourself angry annoyed and frustrated at those around you and the developers themselves we have been screaming for changes for years but it falls on deaf ears do not buy this game the devs dont care about a fun gameplay experience the community would dance on your grave for simply playing the game you re supporting nfts which are a scam the game itself is a never ending grind of misery if you love yourself and want to be happy please run as far away from this horrid thing as possible the biggest horror experience in dbd is dbd itself
