at some point i found that i would prefer dd1 with graphic ui animations upgrade to level of this one huge map in dd2 but activities and enemies variety less than dd1 exploring map is almost pointless because the best gear you can just purchase thankfully at least exploring is interesting you can take only 4 abilities with you no endgame compare to dd1 yes literally no endgame no hard mode no ng and game actually fools you even with vocations its more than dd1 but 1 of them have 0 new abilities warfarer another one is more like joke idk just how they made it you can t attack enemies at all i unequipped weapon and fought with just fists and was more usefull than while using all this vocation kit so we have more variety in dd1 even here and to be clear new hyped aaa release in 2024 somehow looses in almost every gameplay aspect compare to ps3 game released in 2012 just how
