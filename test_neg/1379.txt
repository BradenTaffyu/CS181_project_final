2023 one step forward two steps back i ll start by addressing the elephant in the room you have 300 hours in the game how can you not recommend it well let me do a breakdown of how those hours were spent 150 hours duplicating progress in my own world for sections that i already did with a friend 80 hours riding around the open world and fighting copy pasted enemies exploring dungeons and fighting copy pasted bosses and enemies 40 hours the actual fun part of the game legacy dungeons these areas follow the format of the previous souls games and feature carefully crafted closed off areas with interesting enemies and well designed bosses 30 hours arena pvp invasions co op with randoms so overall that makes 70 hours of fun content and 230 hours of filler if you re planning to buy this game to play with a friend be prepared for a 7 23 ratio of fun to filler content now i d like to get into my criticisms with the game itself open world the open world is honestly really beautiful and engaging in the first 3 areas limgrave liurnia and caelid you won t be able to explore it as intended on a horse while playing in multiplayer but that s not a big deal these first areas have a good amount of content packed into them and you ll be seeing enemy varieties for the first time so you won t be bored of them yet the problem begins 1 3 of the way into the game at altus plateau this area is really beautiful as well and probably my favorite visually but you will start to notice some really empty areas and a lot of copy pasted enemies in the open world after you get through leyndell you arrive at the worst part of the game the mountaintops of the giants this area has i think one single new enemy that is not just copy pasted from the previous areas with a different skin it s not even worth the words to describe how bad this area is if you buy the game despite my negative review here s some advice hop on your horse and ride straight to the boss because there s nothing worth exploring here right after this is another empty snow area but the devs use an innovative trick here most of the area is covered in a snowstorm this expertly hides the areas that they didn t have time to finish so you can t see how devoid of content they are multiplayer first of all the netcode for this game s multiplayer is absolute trash connecting to your friends fails or hangs about 10 of the time and invading requires you to use the item 1 30 times before you ll successfully invade someone as far as anyone can tell fromsoft is basically still using the same netcode that they used back in dark souls in 2011 just with a couple of bandaids thrown on top to prevent infinite backstabs latency is a huge decider of every fight you will have and a lot of the skill comes from being able to quickly identify the approximate ping difference between yourself and your opponent and adapting your tactics accordingly your skills at pve will not carry over at all in pve you can look at an enemy s attack and decide to press dodge if you think it will hit you but in pvp you have to press dodge anyways no matter where their weapon is because of the invisible hitboxes and latency on top of this fromsoft decided to make the latency issues even more prominent by introducing powerful status effects that build up on you even if you successfully dodge an enemy attack the top level of pvp is full of scarlet rot and sleep status abusers who exploit the fact that these status effects build up on you even through dodges and the counter for this is to duplicate items cheating which cure rot sleep in the middle of combat oh and if you want to turn their tactics around on them then you ll need to duplicate items too because the sleep and rot grease are both limited in the quantity that you can obtain legitimately in a single playthrough watching a high level invasion honestly makes me laugh with how many limited use items both players are popping like candies pvp is just laughably broken on top of this there are some multiplayer decisions made by the developers that cannot be described as anything other than stupid first of all co op requires an item to even be allowed to summon people in the early game you ll have to waste some time farming for flowers and probably 10 minutes trying to figure out why you can t summon until you look it up next if you kill a boss you can t summon your friend anymore or be invaded in that area if you kill all the bosses in a particular open world chunk then that whole area is off limits for multiplayer when you kill a boss anywhere in the world even if it s just a random dragon in the open world you will be sent home as a cooperator there are random fog walls preventing you from entering caves with your friend and you ll have to disconnect ride to that spot in your own world enter the cave in your own world then re connect to your friend logical right it obviously improves the gameplay finally even when everything is working properly and the networking issues aren t getting in the way elden ring co op is just horribly balanced after the first couple of early game bosses every challenge in the game starts to become easy most enemies are simply not coded well to deal with multiple players attacking them bosses will change targets anytime they take damage even if it s a tiny throwing knife meaning that aggro juggling is incredibly easy the bosses are supposed to be able to kill you by damaging you and then punishing you when you try to heal but with aggro juggling you will always be able to heal unless you mess up horribly and get killed in a single combo this does happen so co oping bosses can still take a few tries but the difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is night and day despite the fact that the game increases enemies health in co op the game is at least 3 times easier to try to compensate for that my friend and i turned on the taunter s tongue to attract invaders but the game was still too easy because it s incredibly hard for an invader to fairly beat 2 people if you try invading you will probably walk into a blender of 3 people spamming spells and ashes of wars and die in 0 5 seconds this means that the only people who are left invading at higher levels the only people who can manage to have fun within this framework are the players who are willing to use any tactic necessary to win be prepared to deal with lots of duplicated rot grease duplicated starlight shards snipes from across the map with duplicated golem arrows and nuke builds that can kill you if you make a single mistake i don t even blame the players who are using these tactics because without them there would be no invaders at higher levels the game is simply so broken that players are forced to resort to these tactics to have a 0 5 chance of winning invasions story the story is mostly incomprehensible if you rely solely on playing the game you have to watch youtube videos to have any idea of what s going on after watching some though i came to this conclusion every one of the main players is a greedy george r r martin tried to craft a complicated story but the gameplay just doesn t support it imagine game of thrones but there are no background civilians in the story it s just the lords and ladies fighting over empty castles full of monsters that s elden ring every single creature attacks you on sight and there are no visible civilians you are fighting to become the lord of ashes overall the game is alright but it s simply not a good way to spend your time it all comes back to the 7 23 ratio of fun to filler maybe others will find that to be an acceptable ratio but i don t i wish i could get back the hours that i spent on this game and i implore others not to make the same mistake that i did
