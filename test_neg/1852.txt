warhammer 3 a fun game that introduced kislev grand cathay chaos dwarfs the prince of chaos and the realm of chaos factions like khorne nurgle tzeench and slanneesh which if you like chaos or like human factions is a win as those factions mostly don t have any dlc unlocking important units i think that will make a large difference in how you play the game and how enjoyable it is but outside these new factions other factions suffer from dlc before you start reading the rest of this please know that i only made this negative cause i myself do not enjoy the factions of chaos and one of the two human factions above and again these reviews are all opinion based it is okay to disagree with my opinion but for the love of god don t be immature and start name calling my problem with the game is the dlc and how much content is locked behind them and some containing entire species locked behind them for those who don t know and are looking at this game series without having played warhammer 1 2 and 3 most factions on the game map require dlc which if you are a elf lover is fine cause most of their content is free but for any other faction including the realm of man has most of it s content locked behind dlc and both warhammer 1 and 2 have some content in it s base game that s locked in 3 so if you want to play those factions you have to buy those games as well i haven t even mentioned how much it all costs it costs a new player around 150 to get all the dlc edit if you don t care about the dlc and the factions in it then i recommend getting the game but if you don t like generic humans elves or dwarfs then this game is either going empty your wallet or you shouldn t get the game species locked behind dlcnote they all are in their own separate dlcs not in one or two dlcs beastmen pirate coast not really a species but is a faction different from the main faction with it s own entirely different units and mechanics similar to above chaos dwarves ogre kingdoms warriors of chaos the chaos factions from the second game wood elves norse men tomb kings bretonnia i don t suggest getting this faction at all they are bad unless cav spam i will be mocked by a couple of people in warhammer 3s community for hating the large amount of dlc and the requirement to buy each and every game but i d rather inform people than not
