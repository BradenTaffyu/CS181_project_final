2017 i ve always loved the grand theft auto series but this thing they got going with gta v has got to stop singleplayer has been completely neglected while online is getting turned into a hacker infested pay to win game why well here s why everything is expensive while every job gives you nothing but still take two recently said they weren t getting enough money out of their players you re actually able to see how some of the first cars introduced where at a fair price you can then go look at the recent dlc s and see a price of 10x the first vehicles hackers are everywhere and none are really getting detected and banned atleast not enough for the game to be playable without hackers everywhere they recently banned modding in singleplayer in hopes of making sp players go to mp instead allegedly it was to stop hackers in mp even though this ain t how it works so now the only thing that s getting updated with new stuff is the mp part some of all the stuff you can do to make money can t be done without being in a session with other players which means you re kinda forced to be with hackers and rich people with big jets casual players like me stands no chance against that russians loading screens are waaay too long it s time to stop being greedy you re destroying the title along with rockstar games i hate you take two
