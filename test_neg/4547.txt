2016 now before i begin the review i d like to say something really quicklyi absolutely love the game it s by far one of my favorite games of all time or well in the lower end of my top 20 but i simply cannot recommend warframe in its current state the actual reviewwarframe is a free to play third person shooter with mmorpg elements in this game you assume the role as a tenno a faction descended from the long lost orokin empire the tenno control the titular warframes which are essentially robot ninjas in various missions in the the guidance of the lotus a mysterious woman who is responsible for reawakening the tenno from their cryo sleep that s really all i can say about the story without spoiling a lot of the cleverly hidden lore about the game positives massive selection of weaponry and warframes to choose from stunning visuals especially for a 2013 game a very interesting lore and story for those that want a break from slashing aliens to ribbons decent soundtrackhowever every rose has it s thorns and warframe has some nasty ones at that very apparent framerate problems during late game fights what with the massive amounts of enemies and particle effects flying left and right even with an up to date pc grinding can get easily repetitive after a while though that is to be expected with an mmorpg a lot of bugs everything from animation issues to complete crashes can happen at any moment as of october 2016 the endgame is incredibly lacking in things to do when the dev team make chances to weapons or mechanics they are often times for the worse just take the recent vacuum within updates and hotfixes as an example the balance is terrible even with the most powerful weapons players struggle to kill level 100 enemies and said enemies are capable of killing a player in a matter of milliseconds if they re not careful and that s not mentioning the power creep problems that newer items have nowadays although it is free to play there are indeed microtransactions albiet they are not as bad as other f2p games as the only things that can be optained exclusively through real world money are cosmetics prime access accesories everything else can be earned by playing the game if much slower and finally the biggest problem of all the new player experience is garbage several essential things are left unexplained to newer players forcing most to resort to wiki s just to get startedas i stated earlier i still like the game despite its shortcomings but i simply cannot recommend it in its current state
