cockstar doesn t care about the fact that their game is infested with modders who ruin every session and crash other player s games if you want to play this game then solo mode is better for you public lobbies are cancerous and even invite only sessions doesn t protect you from modders cockstar will only do something if a modder is giving money to player s and that s it because if modders give money to player s that means these player s won t open their wallets and buy off their crappy store otherwise they don t care if a modder is killing the entire lobby and ruining all the player s experience
