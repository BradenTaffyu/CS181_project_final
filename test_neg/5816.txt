2018 they are currently discriminating against spanish speaking people german speaking people french speaking people and anyone who identifies as a person from pakistan because of their new chat banning system let me preface that their intentions were probably good as toxicity can ruin a game s community however they clearly didn t give enough of a to test the system or even build a simple system that has existed since runescape instead of finding a clear and concise way to censor slurs and bigotry they outright ban you for saying words that include the combination of letters that would be considered a slur words like racoon red dot weniger the spanish word for black and the french word for lag are all instaban words why they decided to use an automated easily weaponized system to deter toxicity is beyond me because it has done all to curb toxic behavior all they have done is ironically be ethnocentric bigots themselves by assuming people will know english slurs until this is fixed do not buy this game unless you want to be banned for a misspelling or speaking a language other than english
