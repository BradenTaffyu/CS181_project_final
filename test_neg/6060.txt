the devs recently caused nvidia filters to no longer function i have severe eye issues late stage keratoconus and various un diagnosed issues my various aforementioned ailments cause focusing on anything to be extremely difficult my focused view is roughly the same quality as my peripheral vision without using steroid eye drops and i have used nvidia filters to increase the gamma and or brightness and use auto depth of field so i can still play games up until now i have had to use a filter specifically to drastically increase brightness during dredge nightfall as well please note that this filter does not change the intended dark area much without it i cannot see anywhere in the intended visible area without these filters i cannot physically play anywhere near the ability of abled players they also decided to buff dredge this patch i likely will not be able to consistently have playable survivor games for a few weeks possibly months depending on how long this stays please revert this change bhvr or add some accessibility settings for people like me
