this game had a lot of promise but falls flat in nearly every aspect weak and forgettable story and characters easy and repetitive combat against the same few enemy types throughout the whole game i hope you like goblins because you ll be killing a lot of them unrewarding exploration made worse by the fact that all the best equipment is also available from vendors there s no joy in finding hidden treasure chests when they contain nothing interesting most of the time in most games the ng mode is more challenging than the base game not in this there s no noticeable difference in enemy difficulty but the player character is so powerful by then that combat becomes completely meaningless very poor optimisation and performance issues even on high end rigs the visual quality of the game is nothing special and simply doesn t justify the resource usage
