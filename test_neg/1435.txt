total war community seperate multiplayer and singleplayer balance we cant continue this path of nerfing everything in a singleplayer game because the small multiplayer community has broken units the units are designed with cost and buildings and campaign achievements so obviously they dont translate to mp aswell but screwing over you main playerbase for this is silly not to mention nerfing stuff arbitrary so you have literally less options as a player is stupid now everyone is just gonna use the same op stuff as behaviour 1 that was nerfed lmao
