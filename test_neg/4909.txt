2022 i have attempted to play 4 matches so far game has crashed every time when everything was going so good this is trash coming from one of the biggest game franchises in history this is absolutely unacceptable to sell for 70 dollars along with all the micro transactions the ungodly horrendous ui stuttering framerate drops etc either wait 6 months for these greedy scumbags to attempt to fix this garbage or take your money elsewhere to a developer that cares about releasing a good product sick and tired of the fact that this type of thing is becoming the norm for gaming update found out that the game doesnt like when you have an overclocked gpu set clock speed back to normal and the game hasnt randomly crashed again since still dont recommend due to the price tag many other bugs worst ui of any cod ever and micro transactions
