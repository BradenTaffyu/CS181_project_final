2023 do not support warframe they are money mongers to the point where they even have an ingame race about being a cult that worships money self reflection anyways apparently ive been playing since 2014 and just found out if you google nezha is a trap they will ban you for saying this i didn t know this and acknowledged a players name being exactly that nezhaisatrap i laughed but i said nezha is a trap is a funny name i actually thought nezha was a girl this whole time the player then reported me and boom perma banned till 2035 i ve never heard of something so idiotic developers perma ban over an acknowledgement of a users name and misunderstanding of gender of one of there playable characters 650 hours wasted dont play this disaster of a game
