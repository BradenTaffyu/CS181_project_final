2022 i wish i would ve actually looked at the reviews instead of blindly trusting overwhelmingly positive a lot of people that recommend this game have 5 hours or less only 50 of players have passed the first area even less so have passed further areas try to do some research that steam s surface level information won t offer you noita is a decent game it s very well thought out and meticulous the game is absolutely gorgeous what it doesn t tell you is how difficult it really is this game is unnecessarily difficult in my opinion runs typically end in the first area all this stuff you see in the videos about destroying pixels is not available immediately the game does start you with a basic destruction tool but it can be very limited depending on rng there are loads of perks spells wands variations just about the only thing that s similar every run is the intermission shop area you can save during runs and pick up where you left off why i m not going to recommend it it s infuriating i realize its a rogue like i still believe it s unnecessarily difficult the game doesn t teach you how to deal with certain hazards that are quick to kill you there s no explanation on how things are done which leaves it completely up to figuring out things on your own you start every run with a potion some of which are capable of fixing or mitigating certain hazards the most aggravating part is how much you will end up killing yourself more than anything else i m not talking about spells that blow up in your face that will happen a lot too i m talking about how often you can actually find yourself on fire or poisoned with no where to clean it off or put yourself out both status effects will decimate your health bar maybe 1 4 every instance it damages for the full duration yes there are items or perks that make you resist said damage but taking those means you miss out on perks that could change your run from being a beat the boss run to a visit parallel worlds to become a god run i also can t begin to describe the feeling of narrowly winning combat with almost no health to find you get stuck in a small crevice created by said combat that you can t get out of because one small pixel in the middle of it is preventing escaping but your character slid into effortlessly and the only chance of getting out because a lot of spells don t break pixels without hurting you is blowing yourself up and ending your run this doesn t happen often enough to constantly worry about it but it has happened enough that i have to mention it overall i don t hate that i purchased this game i did have wanderlust in the first hour and enjoyed every minute of playing i will not recommend this game solely from my experience playing the only thing that prevented me from refunding it at 90 minutes is i wanted to know if i was missing something more i was but the amount of grief it caused certainly didn t make it feel worth it
