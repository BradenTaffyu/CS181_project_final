2015 i have played this game since october of 2013 and nothing has been fixed they continue to add broken weapons and being unable to properly balance weapons the tec9 is still op it took them months to fix the cz the m4a1 s is still the king of ct weapons due to its lowered spread recoil and higher damage at ranges the hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place you need to be rank 3 to play competitive even if you re a global elite or legendary eagle master meaning you have to play with silvers for 6 hours if you want to play competitive it s especially bad considering you have to buy an operation bloodhound pass to get xp faster they should ve just kept it the same as it was in january of 2013 without the flash boosting the c4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game i refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes which has no eta currently but valve has acknowledged it so basically they said screw you we re not fixing the hitboxes thanks for the money what a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company i can t believe that they have let the game get to this state and valve s support is a joke in general enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply edit i know all the dumb and blinded fanboys are going to dislike this review but believe me you will feel this way when you actually look at the technical aspects of this game and believe it or not there is a game beyond betting and skins i know hard to believe
