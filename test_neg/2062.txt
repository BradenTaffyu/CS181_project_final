2021 this has got to be the most aggressive business model i have ever seen in a game so if you purchase the battle pass you get 16x80 gold that is 1280 the battle pass cost 1360 gold even if you buy the battle pass and only want to use the gold from the battle pass to purchase next seasons battle pass you can t you have to spend money on the game skins on sale are 1700 gold that s roughly 15 for a skin on sale its 2400g not on sale which is roughly 20 that is insane then they have a lootbox system that doesn t contain every skin or item in the game purchasing the deluxe 60 gives 0 gold and 0 silver that s an extremely aggressive business model if i say so myself the game is fun the combat is fun everything is b2p just the added cosmetics on top of b2p on top of lootboxs on top torchbearer on top everything else like they have so many ways to make money yet they charge 60 for the deluxe that barely comes with extras i recommend the game for playing and content i do not recommend due to the in your face buy our premium currency model
