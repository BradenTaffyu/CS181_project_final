2021 i see loads of people defending this game s biggest fault by saying it s supposed to be part of the experience but the biggest fault is the toxic community present in the game which is absurdly prevalent and burdening on options for how you can and will play rather than having the freedom to adventure as you wish you have to learn to constantly accommodate and compensate for the unyielding toxicity of the play style of those around you the game designers haven t incidentally missed this the design perpetuates a dynamic of rewarding random attacks and theft with no downsides there is absolutely no safety zone mode server or setting to protect players for even a moment from attempts to troll grief follow deceive harass and taunt you attempts to have this issue addressed have come from many players since alpha many forums including the official sea of thieves moderated forum are full of people asking for some fix to this dynamic usually the users suggest a pve mode all are mocked by sideways commentary along the same lines as any empowered population lording over and under represented population the sentiment of these mocking comments boil down to we re having fun so we don t care that you re not as if in fear that enabling pve or any non pvp session protection will reduce their fun this is not entirely unwarranted as the population of those who are unprepared and unwilling to take part in pvp encounters would no longer be easily found in abundance and those who remained would have to deal with more difficult opponents the great appeal for many of those who enjoy pvp and the draw that scares game devs from implementing any form of safe zone is simply the thrill of dominating other players when you find them vulnerable it s an addictive pass time that does nothing for you but build a dependence on trying again to get that same thrill of dominance that cannot be found with a peaceful encounter with friendly and willing strangers only with victims the chemical rush from this activity is short lived because the thought processes that stimulate the endocrine system to provide your reward is in the moment and very simplistic the less intense stimulation from peaceful encounters is slower to build and slower to burn off as it comes from a more complex set of processes which can be remembered and built upon some prefer that bigger and more intense thrill and require an environment that facilitates lots of it with new options frequently released to help maintain some level of intensity others prefer a more manageable and sustainable experience that more organically leads to development of the options in which those players wish to partake with far less frequency called for one of these experiences is perpetuated by the sea of thieves design the other is facilitated by world of warcraft ffxiv grand theft auto lotro warframe pirates of the burning sea etc should you decide to buy this game on steam please know that it may very likely take you three or more hours of playtime if you re not rushing through set up character creation tutorial level and then out to a server where you can run into other players and experience this unending toxicity first hand steam will not refund your purchase after three hours of accumulative playtime so if you want to see this for yourself rush through and get out there as fast as you possibly can see if you like it if you do create a new pirate take it really slow through the tutorial to get your settings adjusted and controls the way you like and collect that huge stash of gold hidden in the storage cellar before moving on good luck hope you have more fun than we did
