2020 warframe is pretty incredible considering it s completely free there s a metric sh1tton of content and if you can endure the grind for the very good and responsive combat there s a ton to love that being said i m very glad digital extremes decided to throw away their mask before i dared to give them a penny they ve decided to engage in severing warframe partnerships based on the crime of disagreeing with the opinions of the developers it goes without saying that the world is in a pretty sh1t state right now thanks to certain events but regardless of where you stand abruptly cutting professional ties over a difference in opinion with no bearing on the actual game itself is a practice that shouldn t be endorsed or congratulated
