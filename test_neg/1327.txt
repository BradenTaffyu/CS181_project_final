2022 the game is great the multiplayer is not i bought this game so that i could play with my boyfriend same as we have in other games first of all you do have to farm items to continue to summon your friends there are a lot in the starting areas but in some others there just aren t any materials to do this so you must backtrack this is annoying as i have somewhat limited time to play on top of that you frequently experience crashes and disconnects you have to either backtrack if it s possible to collect your friend again or they need to rush the area what we discovered today drove me to write this review if you kill enough or a certain boss in an area i have no idea which one it is multiplayer is disabled for the open world in this region i cannot play with my friends anymore because i killed something still don t know what this is archaic and stupid for an open world game which has so much to explore we have maybe 1 3 of the dungeons left to do in that area and now we just can t do it together completely outrageous and i may have refunded this game had i known sooner or at least i would have skipped bosses and rushed them at the end another thing to mention is the invasions which can t be turned off if you want to co op since it s an open world game with free progression most of the invaders have been able to oneshot us from substantial range whoops there goes another multiplayer resource time to backtrack and well i ll just forget about my souls after doing all those other chores edit there is now a seamless coop mod use it it s great and what the game should be
