2017 hello ubisoft this is a great game i ve been playing it a lot i even stopped playing cs go and overwatch it is a truly great game that you made i enjoy it much i should give it a positive review because despite some bugs your lack of actions against hackers abusers it is very fun i should but right now i won t right now you re gonna get a bad review right now i do believe that after so many months operation health hahahaha and the overwhelming feedback from players you really need to get your head banged on one thing fix matchmakingit is utterly unnacceptable to still have so many games starting at 4v5 allow fill in at least during pick phase even up until the end of the drone phase of the first round it is unnacceptable to lose that much elo when you lose 3v5 but didn t quit because you commit to matches reduce the loss penalty or remove it for players who stayed in a match against all odds it is unnacceptable that the penalties for quitting a match are so low it is unnacceptable that when the game bugs out on you you can t rejoin the match in half the cases also let us pick the defending room before the operator that s really basic stuff ubi you shouldn t leave your game like this people are going to leave i m about to cheers
