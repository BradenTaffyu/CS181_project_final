2018 amazingly enough this game keeps making you more and more furious about how it is it starts with hackers a lot of them so much so that until you cross the silver barrier the servers will be crawling with hackers second is servers they re soo bad sometimes that neither you or the opposite team are able to play and both teams keep spamming the chat with rage comments on srevers now with panorama you cannot even report servers if they re taking it to a whole new level third worst updates possible i don t get it if they re trying to fix the game with updates or ruin it specially with the latest panorama update which has crippled everyone s performance whether it be ping loss or fps everything is just went downhill since then fourth worst customer support remember if you re facing an issue with the game its your hardware and your internet not the valve they re perfect they literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game instead of helping you optimize the game they ll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there coz the money you give to buy the game doesn t include tech support fifth though this can be included in performance issue but there s times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces only get the game if it is a gift or it s on sale it doesn t worth the full price review update right after i wrote the review i got some hacks which would help me aim and wall and played till i got vac ban which is for 250hrs and going from sem to lem being a waller myself i can gaurantee upon that atleast 50 people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30 have some kind of trigger aim assist i wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game even with free hacks which i used and can play for longer periods of time undetected i got overwatch ban just because i got bored of it and started raging if it weren t for that i could have reached to ge very easily
