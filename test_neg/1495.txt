2022 really can t recommend it at this point wish i could though the minor settlement battles are absolute slogs that are fun about twice before it becomes apparent that they re tougher than walled settlement battles the ai forces them constantly you basically never fight field battles anymore in mortal empires the portals are unfun gimicky and not well thought out the ai instantly knows where artillery and spells are firing the second they re fired cast and instantly dodges it makes mortars and vortex spells useless until you have fully engaged so unless you re skaven no effective value for you ai focuses on sniping units rather than winning which wouldn t be totally off putting if it weren t for its computer level micro the ai is written to target you above all else allies as well refuse to confederate except under extreme conditions overall the game screams of a development team pushing a beta out with cheap cheaty ai fixes and poorly put together gameplay concepts to meet a too early release deadline i ll be playing warhammer ii with mods till it s fixed
