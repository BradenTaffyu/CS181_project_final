2020 early access review ok where to start i played this game for over 60 hours and had a lot of fun but fun ends when you realise that almost everything makes you die in a split of a second dying in explosions only fun first 10 times dying in poison fun only first 5 timesdying because you stepped in teleportation liquid and i teleported you into cluter of enemiesdying because someone shot you with the projectile while you were flying over lavadying because you had a staff that sparks sometimes and ypu stepped into waterdying because something overhead exploded and a fallen rock hit youdying because creatures you summon expired their love meter and this really should be fixed one of the few things i am actually consider a bug i mean you can t even tell they are going to turn on you in a second you stepped in polymorph liquid you turned to sheep and they killed you instantly because as sheep you have like 10 hp you took an electricity perk you dead because all barrels now explode when you near thembut the most cases of dying is from your own spellsyou fould an explosion spell you dead you found a coolest barier spell that kill everyone that walk into it one pixel in front of you when you cast it you deadyou found a lightning spell you fire it close to the wall you deadgiga gravity hole or something kills you because it is doing damage unlike smaller version and you cast it on urself saw discs bounce from the wall to ur facegiga saw disc im not ganna spoil it for you last time i picked a wand with spells fireball droppler ball and something else exploding too thet wand would cast them all at once i knew all thouse spells so i picked a safe spot being in the air and casted i exploded for some reason maybe i had a pixel of earth in front of me or something and stuff like that happens all the time lots of this situations i had could be avoided if i were a bit more careful or used a special cast this spell some distance away modificators but before you get to level 5 you would die the silliest ways possible 50 times or you would play very boring or you luckysonofbitch i really don t know how to fix this because at the same time all this stuff makes game fun but you can t use it because it will kill you if you make the tiniest mistake only thing i can suggest to make some situations better is a spell modifier you recieve only x of damage when damaging youself with the spell edit most of the things above valid after going out of early access
