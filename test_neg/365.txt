2021 hackerfest it s been the least secured competitive game for 5 years already anticheat is nonexistent even i have managed to write a working unbannable due to being unique wallhack for this game without extensive knowledge of processes memory winapi or whatever else is needed there i don t know reports are not working a hacker must get at least 2 or 3 full lobbies to report them in 24 hours in order to be reviewed by overwatch you can basically play 2 games day with hacks and never get banned valve is doing nothing but adding paid cosmetics some all of which are drawn by people from workshop not valve artists no way this lootbox moneygrab should win any award
