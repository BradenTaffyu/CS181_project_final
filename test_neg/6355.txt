2021 i ve been a player of this game since 2018 and have had an enjoyable experience playing it but with recent updates and new added killers such as the trickster that feel out of place the experience just get worse there are significant flaws in the game that have not been patched or fixed no instead the developers implement a battle pass system and more micro transactions that brings more money to the developers pockets yet none of this is used to actually fix the game the devs find several ways to nerf the killers that makes the game such a boring disaster for killer mains good luck attempting to win against gen rushing survivor squads before you know it the survivors will have fixed all gens and you will get queued up for the same experience next game for killers ebony mori s are nerfed which are one of the rarest items to acquire yet survivor keys that let them leave the game prematurely are still just as op it s so one sided it s not even fun it s not even fun for survivors either everyone is playing on the same meta there s a bunch of perks yet half of them are so useless unless you re just in it to throw the game troll look forward to equipping the same stale loadouts for both killer and survivor for your games if you actually want to win and i applaud you if you don t get bored by it oh and i was talking about micro transactions wasn t i it would have been fine if it was solely aesthetic but this game is actually p2w certain killers and survivors have good perks that can only be acquired if it appears in the shrine of secrets or if you actually buy the killer survivor to get the perk if you want to go the shrine of secrets route you have to wait weekly and there is no guarantee it will appear there either it s 2021 and yet games are still relying on scummy p2w mechanics just to get a few extra bucks if dead by daylight had any sort of competition then i m sure they d actually start taking the game s health seriously but for now they don t care and they haven t cared for the past 4 years but for sure when there is a game similar to dbd made by a different company i m dropping this game and i would not recommend anyone else to get into this game unless you re looking forward to a ride of patch notes that will leave you scratching your head by developers who don t even understand what they are doing
