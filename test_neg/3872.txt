2016 bought this game on november 30th 2015 played the single player and finished the campaign okay the not okay part is the online honestly the community is crap in general i m writing this based on my experience playing online there are times where i had to be an to avoid myself from being a troll or rage victim of an angry trolling homicidally insane maniac or even worse a bunch of these in one group preying on almost everyone they see in the same session i know i know there s passive mode and i can turn it on but i can t even punch ais let alone pull out my guns and shoot and kill them if i were to do that another not okay part is the anti cheat system once some retarded hacker spawned a tank a tank in chrome in my apartment another ridiculous part is a hacker spawned of cash on my char s head when i was killing cops the next day i opened online i got banned for 2 weeks nice i filed an appeal for unban nope no reply nothing not even a peep 2 weeks have passed opened online and played with a friend of mine he brought along his other friends as well finished 2 heists cool my friend and his one friend left the game i was alone with his another friend killing cops after the heist was fun not until that little friend of friend of mine joined and start killing cops by flying around and landing from this certain place to that certain place guy was also spawning illegal cash on another friend of my friend before they leave this continued for a few minutes then i got banned for a month nice i filed another appeal despite i expected there ll be no response from the customer service nice nothing no reply 1 month has passed opened online joined a heist group and finished 3 heist missions nice started roaming around in the session i was thrown into after the last heist mission i got bored so i closed the game the next day i had sudden feeling that i should open my e mail i usually trust my inner instinct so i gave it a go opened my e mail andddd bam a very sweet and charming e mail from rockstar saying that i m banned for the third time for no apparent reason nice great didn t want to file an unban appeal because i know the customer service is oh my gosh gta 5 is on sale guess what let s buy it oh you wanna buy it oh sure okay cool i m not stopping you because that s an individual s choice in economics and i m no commie but once you got that game you better be really really really really really really really really really careful with people in the game especially when you re playing online and freeroaming in a random session you ll never know what s coming to you if there s a hacker in the session and you love your money and you don t wanna get banned because of that certain degenerated read my words and digest them properly leave the session immediately the game is great i ll give that for rockstar the online community anti cheat system customer service however are next level terrible crap
