2021 this has been said countless times throughout countless forums and reviews but it s going to be said one more time this is a game that attracts the worst kind of people that s not to say that it is a bad game playing with a full group of friends there s fun to be had whether you re fighting sea monsters digging up chests or if you re lucky having epic pvp ship battles the problem is with that last type because thus far i and my group of above mentioned friends have had one pvp battle otherwise it goes more like this you find a treasure map which uses riddles and hints to make you carefully examine every inch of an island populated by skeletons some of which demand your full attention due to their ability to pop out of the ground suddenly with a barrel of instant killing gunpowder finally after numerous crack shots and expending your limited inventory of items certain npc enemies can only be hurt by certain things you reach the last clue and start counting out paces to dig up your treasure and hear cannon fire the map lead you to the far side of the island so by the time you make it back to your ship you can just barely see the mast sinking beneath the waves what an exciting battle that you were a part of and have lost everything to as in order to get your new ship you must abandon the treasure you dug up and be escorted by a mermaid the community response is usually just that s the game you paid for but sometimes you get someone offering advice leave someone on the ship so one of your group has paid for a game that they don t get to play because while everyone else is off enjoying the game they re staring at the horizon this continues to every other aspect of the game as well sometimes you don t get the option of a sentry defense such as when a ghost ship rises right up out of the waves alongside you for a fight or a kraken latches onto your ship and as you re busy enjoying this real fight another player is fired out of their cannon onto your deck with a full arsenal of bombs solely to ensure that you lose to an npc so that they can have your stuff for free the only defense it seems is to never do anything the final straw for this was having just spent three real world hours sailing in circles while another ship was lurking just on the horizon close enough to watch but much too far to engage with two hours of staring each other down and seeing them turn towards our ship any time we dared to drop anchor and consider actually playing the game only to have them turn away back to the far edge of sight the second we reconsidered and went back to standing off with them it certainly wasn t fun for us and i can t imagine it was fun for them either but that s what it was it s common for people to compare this experience to titles like rust where player to player interaction creates its own stories but rust doesn t boast about it s epic pve boss fights or grand story lines or interesting npcs those are there i m lead to believe but i can t seem to take my eyes off of the sails in the distance long enough to find them
