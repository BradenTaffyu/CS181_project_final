2016 gta v is a hit or miss game the greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative good character development and well written dialogue i would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode at a discount of course i don t think it s worth the 59 99 price tag as it is if you re a fan of a good crime narrative gta v is definitely the game for you perhaps the weakest element of gta v is the online mode most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders hackers false bans and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players which is quite true however let s dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode s overall design structure this review will be mainly about the online experience as rockstar continues to update the game s online sessions with new adversary modes and dlc today if you re buying the game solely for the online experience exercise caution design in a nutshell gta v s online design is nothing short of awful the menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs mission races stunt races to do and some of them don t show up if you want to do a mission you ll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it if you want to do missions with your friends you ll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them loading back to free roam takes a few minutes matchmaking is some of the worst i ve seen in an online experience it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2 4 players together to do any mission when the game actually does pair you up with someone else assuming you don t have many friends who play the game it is with literally any player with any skill level the game will sometimes pair a high level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low level player with most of the weapons locked often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience invites sometimes don t reach your friends glitches with menus occur and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience if you re a fresh player just joining gta v online good luck most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement it will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want rocket launchers grenade launchers explosives etc rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior and you cannot appeal them in summary don t anger rockstar ai very unforgiving at times the ai will be perfectly cunning dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand during missions and heists however most of them are unfair they never seem to miss they always have their reticles glued to you so the moment you pop your head out to return fire they quickly whittle away what little health you have you can restore health in combat with snacks purchased from convenience stores around los santos in free roam freemode if you want to heal when you re being gunned down by police mercenaries or gangsters you guessed it you need to open your interaction menu scroll down to inventory scroll down to snacks and spam the enter key to heal your character then exit the menu to resume combat run out of snacks or armor during a mission you will need to quit to freemode drive to another convenience store or ceo office and restock them buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more how inconvenient the ai isn t easy at all online and requires precise movements well stocked equipment and health and pure luck to beat them down jobs some online jobs similar to quests in an rpg require you to have more than 2 players if you start a solo session or an invite only session most of the fun jobs are all closed off with rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby because rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle in hindsight it might seem like a great way to connect with other players but with the hit or miss community of public lobby gta v online coupled with matchmaking flaws it s difficult to get anything done want to do a heist you are required to gather 4 players together to do them individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5 20 minutes if you fail a heist setup moreoften you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again if a player leaves the heist setup everyone fails the mission and the party leader will need to exit to freemode go back to their apartment re initiate the heist and find 4 new players rinse and repeat heist finales contain the highest payouts with rewards spanning from 80 000 to 200 000 depending on the heist and can range anywhere between 10 30 minutes to complete there are rarely checkpoints in heist finales players have team lives instead of individual lives if one player dies your team loses a life and in 99 of the heist finales only one team life is available therefore if one player continues to die and uses up your team s lives you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint if one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start playerbase gta v online s playerbase is really a hit or miss though they should be somewhat feared there are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists rewards and such but the majority of the time you ll be killed the moment you leave your apartment run over by cars sniped from afar etc this can be combatted with the game s passive mode a mode in which other players cannot attack you and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians the problem with this mode is that you can t rob stores take part in public lobby events or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you also there doesn t appear to much of a localization option with other players you are grouped together with players from around the world god forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier 50 of the time you ll luckily encounter an english speaking player most of the other players are from other countries which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don t speak a common language dlc business model the game s online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive super hypercars cost upwards of 1 000 000 to 6 000 000 there is a plane in game for 10 000 000 luxury yachts go from 6 000 000 to 10 000 000 ceo offices go from 1 000 000 to 6 000 000 apartments go anywhere from 40 000 to 2 000 000 if you re earning 10 000 per job and about 80 000 per heist in a great while you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want rockstar releases free dlc every few months which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags don t want to play the game to earn money simply buy shark cards 20 usd gets you 1 2 million dollars 100 usd gets you 8 million dollars and rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute the business model with free dlc is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro transactions you re not buying a 60 game you re conned into paying for a 500 game that is unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly or stay the heck away from online overall beautiful story story mode gets 9 10 greedy rockstar in online mode bad design mixed playerbase unfair ai disappointing rewards but fun with friends online gets a 4 10
