2022 this isn t to addon to the chinese negative review spam i do not care about the wukong nerf this is a general review aimed at new players considering to get the game that being said i strongly believe the game is new player unfriendly this game is an mmo casual hack and slash shooter on the surface and in practice the gameplay loop is very simple and its enjoyable however if you wanted to make some serious progress you require hundreds of hours of time investment and multiple deep dives into the wikipedia there s a lot of feature and content creep in the game just due to its age and if you re starting out fresh on a f2p account you will be behind the curve and struggling to keep up with even the most basic missions with no clear direction to go other than unlocking the entire map i would say its fun with friends but if there s a serious gap in mastery rank you will be eating dust trying to catch up to your friends while they power carry you thru missions the game is fun if you are willing to put forward the effort and learn its deeper mechanics to get some of the higher end gear requires a combination of commitment to the trading system multiple micro transactions of the game s premium currency and or weeks worth of grinding
