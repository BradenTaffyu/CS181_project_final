2019 i love this game so much i really do but the community and being permanently banned for toxic behavior has ruined it completely for me it s funny because i was banned for being toxic to someone who was being toxic to me the game is really really good but until ubi get s their sh t together i wouldn t recommend buying it keep in mind i literally spent 300 hours of my life on this game never to play it again because i was permanently banned buyer beware this game is very very toxic if anyone reading this played a call of duty game and went into game chat it is literally about is bad as that the game is amazing though sh tty servers and hitboxes make it difficult to play at times at this point and the game and being permanently banned i really never want to play this game again because i can t and really hope that anyone reading this will not buy it because of the reasons that i listed people being toxic is ruining video games in that case if you do decide to buy it please beware of all of these underlining things i really hope that ubi fixes this stupid stuff also ranked is usually fair because of hackers and smurfs i never thought that i would be having to write this review about a game that i love
