2021 i rarely ever write steam reviews but this developer straight up lied to the community and claimed to have no involvement with production of an nft a few weeks ago only to turn around and announce today they worked closely on developing said nft i love dead by daylight but i won t in good conscious support a developer who lies to their community and is involved in the production of nfts which harm the environment and continue to inflate the price of the pc market wish i could get a refund for the pinhead chapter because i don t want to support this decision in any way
