2022 i won t be going into a deep dive of the positives of this game you have probably heard everything positive already about this game i want to go into my experience and how i eventually just got tired of it the game starts off throwing a lot of random buzz words at you that might make 0 sense for me it was a confusing mess that took a while to sort of understand after that i had a pretty enjoyable time its fun to just play with friends and mindlessly kill stuff then i did that again and again and again and again i think you get the point the story still kept me going for a while and i thought i was making some alright progress in the game then the game threw this massive open world at me filled with stuff to do and then it did that again at first i was genuinely impressed and once again confused but the more i played this part of the game the more i started realizing this really is a free to play game to progress in these areas you are practically being told to treat the game as a job you clock into every day daily activities as well as the heavy grind absolutely soured my taste of any positives the game had going for it at that point i completely lost sight of what the game actually expected me to do play the overworld do normal missions focus on grinding for better suits do the story i genuinely couldn t tell anymore what the game was going for and what i was really playing the game for its exactly at this point where progress started to feel like a snails pace i already played like 100 hours of the same types of missions what else was there to see that made me decide to quit the game it still probably is a fun game to just jump into and play from time to time but the game doesn t want you to do that it wants you to consistently log back in to spend money and time i would rather spend my time on other games that respects my time and money more then this game if you want to play it go ahead its still a solid game but if your time spent ends up amounting to anything will rely purely on what you are trying to get out of this game
