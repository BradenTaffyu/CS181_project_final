2014 update 4 3 15 i started playing again once i heard about the sanctuary update it had a dragon warframe included so why the not right any i picked up right where i left off months ago and some nice changes have been made the new law of retribution raid is pretty much the only reason i can recommend this game now for a variety of reasons it gives you a purpose for one before i was just swapping gear and getting more powerful just to do the same old and get even more gear now with a massive raid as challenging as this i finally had a reason to get my frames up to snuff and whatnot secondly this raid is the only gratifying victory in the game i felt accomplished only by the end of lor nothing else as this was the only mission that wasn t just a fetch quest or grind another thing i ve learned to love about the game since i picked it back up again is the glory of trading do you know how fun it is to rip off people who paid real money for digital in this p o s game for your digital it s insanely fun yes kind sir you can pay 30 for platinum and exchange it for my crappy rare mod that i have lying around then i ll buy the mesa warframe with your cash and you can enjoy a crappy mod that i can farm again in under an hour it s great fun as long as you re not on the idiot side of things in short here s the scoop chroma the law of retribution raid and ripping people off for plat are the only kicks i can get out of this game and now that i ve done all three i assume i ll rarely be picking this up again after my recent binge this game is still the equivalent of smoking in that just because you unwittingly catch yourself doing it doesn t mean you d recommend it to others update over enjoy the original review below it s addictive for all the wrong reasons sure the space ninja gameplay starts out fun enough what with the stabby stabby and shooty shooty but then well you realize that your only options to explore more of the game consist of a spending real world dollars on ridiculously overpriced content or b grinding and farming your way to the top of the free to play food chain now of course the game is built for farmers and grinders because there is a lot of farming to be done every single item requires a blueprint which requires farming then materials which require farming then parts of the blueprint which need farming then the final assembly which requires farming and grinding in short you could be looking at seven hours worth of work and literally three days worth of waiting just to build a new pistol unless of course you d like to speed that process up for a measily 9 99 now i m not not knocking the monetization as considering the game s target demographic the farming aspects are very well done and you re ultimately never really shoved into a corner where the devs beat you up and steal your lunch money but here s the thing it s not addictive because the gameplay is great it s only an okay time killer and it s not addictive because any of the rewards are great because no one gun or warframe is that spectacular no it s addictive because the temptation to get more whatever that more might be for you is always there after 40 some odd hours wasting away my life on this game i realize that there was no real accomplishment to show for it no overarching story no greatly increased op character no real progress just a swap of this frame for that frame this gun for that gun in short it was like shuffling a deck of cards for 40 hours if you have literally nothing better to do with yourself and want to spend days weeks and months of your life like that warframe is hands down the free to play game for you but poke past its initially endearing facade and you ll find a game so utterly trivial even by video game standards that shame is all you ll feel long after ignoring the clock
