2017 rockstar has truely ruined a great modding and online platform gta v had two selling points a fun online experience and a highly modifiable singleplayer mode with recent events unfolding singleplayer modding has been deemed illegal so all your custom experiences have gone down the drain secondly their online platform has turned into a show and requires you to grind endlessly for a single vehicle or property in which prices seem to go up alot higher after every update normally that wouldnt be a problem who expects to get things without work but rockstar has made it into a repetivite procces that gets boring after the first hour i would not reccomend spending your money on this game or anything made by rockstar due to their attitude to their community and their way of leeching their customers for money
