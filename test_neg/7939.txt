2022 the game itself is really fun but the players absolutely ruin everything everyone i ve met in this game has been children toxic racist or pvp sweats my last 20 hours of play i haven t made any gold at all because i get sunk before i can sell anything can t even get past level 2 emissary 90 of the time it eventually just gets tedious and unfun i ve been pretty good at the pvp in this game i was the one in my crew who actually boards and kills everyone but just because i m good at the pvp doesn t mean i want to do it constantly i have met maybe 4 friendly crews in the 100 hours of game play i ve invested edit thanks replies you guys are totally uplifting and make me want to keep playing
