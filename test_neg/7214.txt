honestly for the price i cannot recommend this game in good faith although there are some good aspects it just has way too much working against it first and probably most obviously the performance for how long it s been out this really shouldn t still be as much of an issue as it is but there are so many reviews that touch on this that i ll just move on if i had to pick a second thing it s the class system the classes in the first game were enjoyable there were a good variety of skills to choose from and you could equip enough of them to create builds that felt like they had character in this game you re limited to only four skills or three if you re a warfarer and don t want to go into your equipment menu to change weapons every 30 seconds even though the only thing that makes this a less appealing choice than using the warfarer meister skill is the inconvenience especially considering it costs stamina to use and if you re playing as a magic user it just always feels like there is something missing from your kit for other vocations like the mystic spearhand it feels like if you could use six skills instead of four it would be really enjoyable but instead you re always missing one crucial piece of your best form additionally while the combat can be challenging and interesting at first after completing your first run of the game practically every encounter is completely trivial because you re just way too strong for the enemies you generally encounter personally i got to the point that i literally could not try new combinations of skills on enemies because they would die before i could finish executing the second skill unlike in the first game there is no hard mode i ve heard something about automatic difficulty scaling in this game but if that is an actual feature i haven t noticed it since the combat and exploration are the main focuses of this game and it does those to an acceptably well i was prepared to skip over my complaints about the story but recalling my experience of the first game i really just could not bring myself to give it a pass the premise seems cool but the execution of the main plot is sorely sorely lacking several story elements don t even really make sense and while on the surface it seems like the game wants you to be able to approach the story in whatever way you want there are really only two endings as far as i m aware and either can be locked off if the relevant npcs have died there is no simultaneous multiplayer to speak of at all period maybe there s a mod for it i haven t looked this was also the case in the first game but in that game the experience was amazing despite the lack of multiplayer by contrast in this game the lack of multiplayer is just one more problem on the heap of issues that make it fail to live up to its promise if the game did have multiplayer i might honestly recommend it despite its multitude of other flaws then there s the controls good gods above the controls i could probably write an entire essay on why i hate them so i ll just fire them off in quick succession and move on targetting system is completely borked and it s nigh on impossible to aim spells or staff bolts at the correct target except in ideal conditions a stark contrast to the first game where you could manually aim almost any spell and your staff bolts would fire pretty much where you are looking sliding will completely lock you out of controlling your character in any meaningful way rendering you completely defenceless for the duration and will happen in seemingly nonsensical places you cannot swim period and while in the first game it seemed like a reasonable design choice to limit the areas the player could explore to put a cap on the scale of the game in this installment it really just seems like laziness the exact reason would be a spoiler but you ll understand if you see the endgame landing on top of certain enemies will instantly throw you into a ragdoll state which results in forced unavoidable damage even if it was your own attack that put you there there is no auto run feature which makes the long travel times agonising especially considering the extremely limited fast travel options on mouse and keyboard there is no way to toggle the walk speed you have to hold alt to move more slowly than your running speed whose idea was this seriously and it s made worse by the next point on mouse and keyboard there are several important keybinds that are 1 placed on seemingly nonsensical keys 2 cannot be reassigned and or 3 must have a modifier key like ctrl assigned with them even if there is no real reason it has to editing keybinds on mouse and keyboard is frustratingly limited especially considering how many of the default keybinds make it seem like whoever designed the controls has never played a game on a keyboard before i ll stop there this is already way too long the game is very pretty when the graphics are actually working properly and the combat and exploration can feel fun and rewarding at times but at the price point i can t say i m happy with my purchase i would have much rather spent my 65ish bucks on my ffxiv sub and i don t even like the combat in that game and if you ve played the first dragon s dogma game graphics aside this game is pretty much a strict downgrade if this game was like 30 maybe it d be worth it
