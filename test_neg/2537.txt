2022 i guess it isn t the game for me 3it could be that i can t keep up with the fast paced nature of the game or maybe i was expecting something else coming into this because it s a part of the titanfall unappreciated gem chefs kiss gameplay universe i thought maybe casual is hard since you get a mixed bag of players and so i tried rank and ranked ended up being frustrating because every single match there are silver players with atleast 5000 kills in my low af bronze lobby even towards the end of a season and i just don t find it fun to play as a newcomer by the time i m done looking for decent weapons i ll be taken out by someone 3this cycle of dying and joining another match q times are great actually i get matches very fast lol is all good for the first 5 hours or so but after that it just gets annoying or maybe i m just downright bad at the game regardless of the how the game operates xd
