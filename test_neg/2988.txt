2022 this review is about gta v onlinei don t even know where to start while the game has so much potential to provide a good gaming experience it somehow manages to fail at almost every aspect that makes a game enjoyable the community is the worst i have ever seen and i ve been playing games for over 25 years there is not a single lobby where there aren t any cheaters hackers and yes i purposely call em that be it the guy that just uses a mod menu to have fun with the game those are not healthy for the game but somewhat tolerable or the guy that teleports across the map to other players having god mode on and randomly killing anyone they come across just to forcefully exit crash your game when you give them a hard time doing that it is actually unplayable in most public lobbies due to the insane amount of disturbed and sad souls out there it s just a perfect example of what happens when anyone can have power even if there is no hacker trying way too hard to make your experience the worst there are still unbelievably many people griefing randomly killing anyone they come across and the best part sarcasm about all that is that the game entitles you to do that if someone tries to deliver products to get a little bit of money which they can spend on 1 5 of a car the whole lobby gets a message about what you are doing and that they should kill you and take those products the game tells you to be a toxic person and since the game is catering to kids at least as much as to adults lets not forget that this game is rated m 17 rockstar is creating a prototype of gamers that are out of anyone s control it is a widely known fact that rockstar does not listen to their community at all if you can even call it a community because it contains the word unity r has made over 6 billion dollars from this game yet they leave the game in such an unbelievably bad shape riddled with bugs no anti cheat precautions extremely out of touch additions vehicles and stories very bad controls balancing ai obsolete features damn the list doesnt even stop there that is has nothing to do with what they got known for this is a game that feels like it is halfway through developement they are milking their players with an insane amount of ignorance and everyone who buys shark cards ingame money for actual money is actively supporting what they do how did this happen well money money is the answer here the developers take awards smile at the cameras bathe in money ignore those that made them who they are and they are getting away with everything some pros would be that it is a pretty decent looking game for such an old game and the driving has improved quite alot also you definitely can have a good laugh from playing this game i wish i could add more to this list but it gets tainted by everything bad about it way too much would i recommend this to anyone well no maybe play the single player game if you can pick it up from a sale but if you think you will get that good ol gta vibe but with friends this time be prepared for a hell of a surprise rockstar has lost hundrets of thousands or even millions of potential buyers that liked to play what r made them who they are or at least who they were if you could sell your soul to the devil be sure they did not only sell their soul they happily ripped it out of their bodies took a piss on it have it go through all circles of hell and laughed maniacally while getting a molten gold injection in their liveless bodies edit oh and please take a look at those reviews anyone with a working brain should realize it s mostly children and trolls writing those reviews like come on
