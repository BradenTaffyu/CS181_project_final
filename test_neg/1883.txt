2023 total war warhammer 3 is for me the most colossal failure of a sequel i have ever played from the botched launch to copious bugs from poor design decisions to exorbitant pricing for new dlc from poor optimization to scarce updates i cannot justify recommending this in lieu of broaching all of that to offer a microcosm of the current state of the game how about i post just the bugs that they acknowledge fps drop on cathay s terrace farming field maps harald hammerstorm can unlock indomitable skill but is already unbreakable when confederating bretonnian factions upkeep for questing knights goes to 0 if lord has knights vow complications with ariel spawning if you are beaten to rebirth by another wood elf faction repanse is missing her unique mount model suleman some of harry the hammer s abilities show placeholder text snotling pump wagons do oversized damaged new regiments of renown units don t have unit caps nakai can t recruit kroxigors and other units damsel s progression for vows is not advancing as intended von carstein blade not being rewarded to caravans finishing at castle drakenhof bloated corpses exploding randomly at the start of battles free company no longer appear to have their weapons in combat crone hellebron death night missions not triggering in domination battles units with both frenzy and unbreakable lose frenzy when summoned as reinforcements heroes can get stuck in an attacking army and cannot move when defending zharr naggrund wall towers are not controllable and do not fire gatehouses on zharr naggrund can be attacked leading to units being crushed ungrim s ability journey s end not working ranged battle ai is sometimes passive thorek ironbrow appears distorted in battle units on zhufbar map appear to be floating soft lock when using the hellforge tutorial skinning issues with centigor units support religious errantry not working for bretonnians various technology tree oversights champions of chaos cannot upgrade daemons using warband upgrades throgg is not immune to kislev winter and yvresse mist attrition teal visual effect on glade captain s bow disappears when she is firing ai moves just outside of player range ambush battles do not properly start with army full of stalk units as ai cannot attack them sometimes ranged units begin running into melee after running out of ammo with guard mode on iron daemon dreadquake mortar manual fire orders ignored despite ui showing orders present event message army receives plague has placeholder text sea encounters can cause the game to crash some trait and tech tags are incorrect do not work the ui scale can t be adjusted below 120 on 4k screens units particularly flying and cavalry getting stuck calling back a group cathay fire rain rocket crew continue fighting after being dismembered beheaded ai controlled vlad von carstein is too tough in battle all chaos dwarfs factions show player s manufactory upgrades in the ui ai controlled dark elf factions build too many black arks continued reports of anti player bias in campaign ai targeting line of sight issues over some unit types and certain map features hellcannon projectiles alter course towards end of firing arc causing misses valkia slam attack causes grey texture at point of impact some norsca monster hunts not working correctly chaos dwarf lords with great taurus mounts are susceptible to falling off walls opening some ui panels causing performance issues various siege and settlement battle issues e g weak settlement garrisons weak walls and gates ladder deployment awkward pathfinding n kari s charge animation seems to trigger too early various missing sync kills grimgor enemy killed in battle event message has incorrect faction name various units unaffected by red line skills some uncommon common magic items showing better stats than rare items incorrect model for skink oracle showing in character details blood splatter flickering on the ground if blood pack enabled cylostra is sometimes blocked from attacking an enemy settlement or army wrong ogre kingdoms contract mission is sometimes given when selecting a specific contract destroying a tower on high elf lothern will create a breach in the wall leaving floating decals whispers of t zarkan could be more frequent units spawning under the map unique traits introduced in warhammer iii require balancing ku gath has a rough start in immortal empires borrowed armies from factions will loyalty sometimes rebel threaten may cause the game to crash in multiplayer campaigns orion s faction ability can make it easy to generate free armies visual issues with portraits some unit models have excessively bright bloom ambushing an army in forced march and letting them walk of the map causes the opposing army to die autoresolve values seems overly favourable towards the player in immortal empires inconsistencies in passive abilities or traits descriptions some characters get more skill points than there are skills to invest them in eyestrain sickness visual issues with trees spawning on maps changed game settings are not saved if player is leaving the game without properly closing it chasing routing units is somewhat ineffective cults are not impactful in campaign gameplay corruption effects border textures visual issues intended plague effects can easily get overwritten by other plagues multiplayer desyncs when the ai s turn ends if one player is still going through the end turn cycle that doesn t include bugs like ariel not being recruitable that are listed as fixed but still aren t and bugs that they haven t even acknowledged despite being in game since launch the list becomes unmanageable when trying to compile all of them there are 276 bugs that the community bug fix mod alone covers there are hundreds more that aren t covered calling it unacceptable seems like an understatement i waited 18 months to post a review to give them time to rechart the course of the game while i will still hold out some hope for the series primarily because i have enjoyed them so much in the past and that it fills a niche with no real competitors it is clear that creative assembly has underfunded and underdeveloped the game exploited the good will they garnered after total war warhammer ii and will continue to do so if you want to continue supporting them that is your prerogative but i can no longer gloss over the myriad failures with the game and company
