2023 this is actually the first time i have had a hard time writing a review on a game weirder still i haven t ever really ever been inclined to leave a negative review on a tw game even the saga games for what they were i found enjoyable to a degree normally speaking it has been pretty black and white i either enjoyed the game and its mechanics or i didn t however with the release of the new dlc the sheer lacklustre attempt made by ca to generate new content for their players and keep prices reasonable is nothing short of a joke the game in and of itself isn t necessarily even bad i still find myself plugging away hours of tzeentch however the response by the creators to their literal target audience you know the people that feed their continued ability to create any games let alone make those that they do actually succeed in the marketplace was shocking buy our or we stop supporting the product was the theme of the day on this one we appear to live in a day and age where justified criticism over a product from its consumer for it not feeling like it justified the cost applied or like a complete product is met with threats and not understanding or a genuine attempt to engage those involved should honestly be ashamed of themselves and not be then overly surprised if their next product doesn t do as well as it may have done this is literally how you diminish your target audience not how you grow it unless of course they took a look at bud light and thought to themselves hold my beer would strongly advise they fire their pr team and perhaps hire someone competent after that stunt
