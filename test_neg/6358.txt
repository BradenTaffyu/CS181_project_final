2016 they promised a horror experience didn t realise they meant the matchmakingafter a few updates survive with friends matchmaking is only getting worse before everyone had to click ready every 15 seconds for like 20 minutes to get a game we asked for at least an auto retry function now after recent update mid sept the game says it finds a game immediately and goes to loading screen i was so happy for 5 seconds only for everyone to get booted to the main screen this happens every time so you will have to remake lobby and invite everyone to try again i liked this game enough to waste some time in a lobby but this is just in excusable i guess daylight has come update 25 okt 16matchmaking is fixed for the most part finally omg there is still enough glitches to be fixed in this game but at least you will be able to play it its a fun game if you dont care about the ranks being reset every month or the hosts being laggy which causes a lot of weird stuff in game still i would not recommend it this was my first and last time to buy a game from this behaviour digital inc team because im playing a released game that is still under developement although it seems to be common now a days with all the easy downloadable updates please dont release a game until its finished and tested
