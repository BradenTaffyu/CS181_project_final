2017 short version are you a troll you will love this game do you dislike being trolled don t waste your time long version i will say this the sound effects and atmosphere are really well done beyond that the graphics are only adequate and the controls are somewhat clunky much of your controls are intentionally gimmicked in a vague attempt at presenting limitations to one side or the other what kind of spoils the game is the lopsided nature of the matches one side or the other generally steam rolls you either have a killer that is far over powered and just trashes the 4 victims or you have 4 highly experienced victims in voice chat coordinating their way past a killer who can t keep up rarely will you see a balanced match and the game isn t designed to be fair 4 v 1 with all of the power ups from leveling designed to give even more advantage to one or the other it certainly hits a certain niche that isn t seen in other games and i really enjoyed the atmosphere it creates where it kind of falls apart is the toxic nature of the community you can t even win a game without being hated on for simply doing what the game wants you to do as the killer you are supposed to dominate and wipe out the other team done correctly you often can just wipe the floor with them literally dragging them around and plopping them on hooks to struggle a highly skilled killer against 4 uncoordinated victims and the victims are simply not going to enjoy themselves and they are going to feel trolled and in turn swear and cry and moan in the chat afterwards apparantly you are supposed to just let them win so they can level up on the flip side 4 coordinated victims especially if they grouped and use voice chat can run circles around the slow plodding killer and leave the killer with almost nothing to do in those games its lopsided the other direction the killer ends up like a bot just patrolling from one place to another and being avoided entirely played this way the killer is just a walking simulator and quite frankly the victims spend the majority of their time just sitting and staring at an engine waiting for it to be fixed oh look i get to hit space bar again again again anyway i can t praise the sound effects and atmosphere enough unforunately those are the only stand out features to the game the majority of it is a lot of walking around either trolling or watching engines be repaired it never really feels competitive to me every match feels lopsided you either dominate or just get walked all over and you can expect to be treated to a tirade of toxic nonsense afterwards i ll play some more when i m in the mood to troll little kids and stick them on hooks but beyond that it s really repetitive and unless you come into it with friends the community has been pretty dam rude so far side note my girlfriend also plays this game with her circle of friends my opinions here are based on watching them play as well as my own experiencesit s an ok game and if steam let you give a more detailed rating i d probably be more in the middle than i am negative unfortunately steam only allows thumbs up or thumbs down and this game needs a few more thumbs down to get the point accross this is a very niche game be aware of what you are getting into there are certainly some who will enjoy it for me it s going to be infrequent but i will keep it installed for an occasional laugh
