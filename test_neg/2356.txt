2021 after playing 100 hours of this on steam and another 100 hours on origins and dropping 160 on the game to get ramparts heirloom they banned my account for seemingly no other reason than gameplay disruption because i cant stay connected to a game with their house servers have sent in multiple requests to get my account unbanned but i guess they cant afford real humans to work there either so i cant get any real help on getting my account back thanks ea of not only robbing me of my time but now my money because i liked the game enough to support it but they got what they wanted i suppose please do not support ea and the way they handle this game they care more about bringing in more content for you to buy then your ability to actually play and enjoy the game
