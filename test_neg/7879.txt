2023 the community in this game is the worst i ve seen by far in any game i ve ever played firstly i shouldn t be name called and harassed for playing a game that i once enjoyed so many times i ll be playing and encounter someone who hasn t put the game down since it s conception and is the most toxic person in the entire world it happens quite a bit and then i get my stuff stolen i do love wasting 2 hours of my life for it to be stolen but that is the name of the game and it sucks this game is very draining to play and hard to get back into when you get your stolen by others especially when they are extremely toxic and just straight up about it obama gaming does not approve of this game i hate sea of thieves and all it stands for and nothing will ever change that but that s just me there is fun to be had in this game but i have rarely ever found it
