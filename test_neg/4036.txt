2015 single player is fantastic so why the thumbs down gta online it turns the game into a way over regulated sandbox i m going to start with modding because it s the sole reason that a large number of fans prefer to play gta on pc as opposed to console private modders motivated solely by wanting to do crazy things in this big open sandbox would do just that create tools sometimes even scripting languages and such to expand previous installments to way beyond what they were as of late may the relationship between rockstar and modders is tumultuous at best rockstar realizes that the modding community is a huge aspect of the success of pc releases but they didn t really prepare for the modding community and it has ended up clashing with their regulated sandbox and business model which is a hodgepodge of things that companies have been doing in the last 5 years that have worked so what is this regulated sandbox that i keep going on about and why is it so flawed lets start with the reputation experience point and currency systems ironic coming from someone who used to be a rabid rpg fan but experience points in an online game are a bald faced skinner box system that gives a game artificial longevity and is essentially a mechanism for compulsion it takes somewhere between 150 and 250 hours to hit level 120 which is where you ve maxed out everything except the maximum number of armor you can carry to get there you can go through hastily assembled missions that don t even have voice acting heists which get old after awhile various deathmatches parachuting races and a bunch of activities that most people don t enjoy doing like tennis and golf there are daily objectives that help speed up this leveling process but it s just another compulsion loyalty element as it must be performed every day the problem with this system and much of it stems from the fact it takes so long to max out everything is how imbalanced it makes the game if you re a level 8 in a deathmatch against a level 110 you re probably going to be annihilated because the level 110 has twice as much health as you and more armor capacity not to mention faster reload speed and less recoil if the deathmatch is allowing inventory weapons the imbalance gets much worse with weapons like rpg and heavy sniper to contend with races are no better you cannot win a bicycle race if you lack max stamina which allows you to pedal furiously forever versus about 15 20 seconds with sub max handling and other aspects are affected by driving skill and of course unlocked weapons affect the outcome of a gta race custom vehicles also imbalance races so basically rockstar made all this regulated pvp and yet it s completely imbalanced and thus can t be taken seriously it s no wonder that so many deathmatches are made simply for farming rp and cash i go back to my artificial longevity point to mention that most people are going to pick a few things that they like however no one wants to repeat the same mission over and over nor will most people want to get trounced in pvp by people who have no life irony intended what is especially hard to stomach about all of this is that the game itself openly mocks the majority of what they re doing with their call of duty parody named righteous slaughter 7 xp persistent upgrades and pay to win are among the things they mock all sins that gta online commit even though this compulsion system is highly flawed rockstar is hard at work protecting it against the evil modders how dare people not earn level 120 by shaving weeks off their lives how dare people get money from some other source than rockstar to purchase roughly 30 million worth of goods that are exclusive to the online stores there was a mass banning in early may 2015 over this reason rockstar wants you to buy their imaginary money with micropayments much like zynga in fact with price points almost lifted directly from zynga s catalog the highest price point is even you guessed it 99 99 for the whales and let me put this into perspective rockstar has made roughly 3 billion from game sales alone it s the most profitable single game ever made and they re alienating an important part of the fan base for what surely amounts to less than 1 100th of that now it s worth noting that rockstar is trying to figure out how to handle the modder issue but it s a bit too late the port needed to be made modder friendly from the ground up they could have released server software and automatically have stat changes on private servers not be reflected on rockstar servers however because they didn t it s going to be some time probably not until gta vi that these issues are resolved so what about their own creation tools i ll start with the video editor it s less flawed than the creator but it s only good for artsy videos if you need to make any kind of tutorial style video don t even bother the caption length is too short the caption placement handling is awkward and the text editor for captions lacks basic features like clicking between letters and having the cursor go there the creator is very flawed in overhead mode it can be very difficult to place checkpoints on hills if you want to place any objects in midair you need to spend many hours manipulating the very fine time space windows allowed for this kind of placement even though some of the most popular community maps use this rockstar hasn t embraced it and has kept it limited there s also a profanity filter that s so poorly written that words like sniper and skyscraper get filtered out of descriptions it s virtually impossible to promote your maps and there s a glut of maps due to there being mini achievements for publishing a map and having it played it s possible for maps to be viewed as corrupted and need to be made from scratch it s happened to two of my crew finally once you publish a map any time you go to update it you can t save a local copy without making a brand new duplicate it won t update for anyone who has bookmarked the old version and the editor will crash a lot even on low settings this aspect didn t fit in anywhere else but the online loading times are terrible it can take over a minute to load into a freemode game with all the complaining in this review which might be viewed as unfair i need to contrast this game with tf2 valve has embraced the modding community with all its source games including tf2 rockstar is struggling with it in gta v in tf2 players pay real world money for cosmetics that don t affect gameplay while in gta v real world money is used for an in game advantage tf2 does charge for weapons but these weapons are easily acquired via trading or random drops far easier than in gta v but it s only fair to point out tf2 s one sin tf2 s hammer tool is frankly superior to rockstar s creator though i can only fairly compare the interface speed and how much potential time is lost due to errors with the software alliedmodders a fan made company handles all the other aspects of tf2 modding and they do it well because they care tf2 lets fans run servers and valve only very lightly interferes with the management of these servers entirely related to paid cosmetics which is fair gta v isn t there yet and may never be there tf2 has balanced pvp gta v does not gta v has artificial longevity through skinner box methods while tf2 s longevity is a product of a solid base along with the company working along side its community it should be no wonder that gta s been slowly losing players and will soon be overtaken by the aging tf2 i write this scathing review not to bash gta v but in the hopes that it will be read and will influence the development of gta vi gta s overall fan base is enormous hopefully rockstar will get it right in the next installment
