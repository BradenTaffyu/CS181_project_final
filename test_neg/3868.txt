2017 grand theft auto v the greatest example of how to release an absolutely stunning fantastic game on launch day and then completely muck it up with miserable post launch decisions and greedy marketing when your parent company flat out wants to squeeze every last dime out of it s daily player base as possible gta v is one of my favorite open world games of all time it s a beautiful well crafted world with interesting sp missions and a functional hic online that said i bought this game knowing it would be modded like every gta game has been for like 15 years i also bought it on the basis of gta online being something i could play regularly and have decent progression and have a vain hope of unlocking content in without devoting my 24 7 life to grinding for money with the shoe horning of shark cards and an endless stream of supremely overpriced content online with little actual fun content added to it that makes me actually want to play it for fun rather than feel like i m grinding for cash every waking minute it completely ruined the experience of gta online who really wants to farm cash to blow 10m on an in game car or plane for reference that s more than 100 usd real world money worth of premium micro transaction shark cards if you wanted to just skip the time and buy a plane pair that with the fact that there has not once been an update to gta v s single player mode more importantly you can never get the premium online vehicles in single player to mess around with and enjoy the vtol hydra nope all those amazing super cars nope low riders and super bikes with boost nope rolling tank military suvs delivered to your doorstep nope none of it that was until the glorious modding community came around and added all the best features and content of gta online back into single player for all of us to use that was great i could play the game the way i wanted access all the content i ve paid for and i don t have to deal with online players destroying my vehicles if i don t want to that is however until the corporate overlords at take two interactive decided to file a cease and desist claim against openiv the primary crew that made modding gta iv and gta v possible the best tool available to make all other mods compatible and the very backbone of single player mods in gta v yes single player despite their claims that openiv is allowing exploits into the gta online world it is not openiv has nothing to do with online it it a closed source software so no one can exploit the reverse engineered software to hack the game illegitimately and it even disables itself if you go online so none of your mods will carry over they purposely built the utility to tick all the boxes and keep the software for single player use only but that doesn t stop tti from shutting them down on the basis of it being harmful to their online community well sorry to tell you but the online in gta v is already a vile hell with a plethora of third party hacks that have nothing to do with openiv those are the people that need to be getting cease and desist orders not the one team that did everything in their power to keep their tool on the up and up and appeal to take two rockstar s wishes for online to be their property with no outside mods update june 23 2017 as of writing it appears that take two have stepped down at least to a degree and that openiv is back in action and being updated so potential for modding may have returned that said this review will remain negative due to the fact they not only tried to pull a massively anti consumer practice and only turned around after massive backlash but also the fact that the last two years since the game s release on pc have been nothing but endless efforts to add more and more costly updates to gta online but they also have done nothing to support the single player and as this recent debacle shows they are actively trying to get people away from the single player and into gta o because the sp doesn t net them a constant stream of microtransaction money frankly gta online is one of the worst grinds for content i ve come across in recent years modding things into sp is the only way for many like myself who have actual day jobs and responsibilities to even access half of gta 5 s content in a reasonable time frame
