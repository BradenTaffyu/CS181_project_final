2023 i love this game and i have spent hours modding it but ca has done nothing but break the game and make it harder to mod each update adding new things that seems to make modding harder for no reason or changing mundane things that break every single portrait for no reason why did you add no culture when you had portraits done perfectly why is the database tables constantly changed ca isn t a small indie company there isn t an excuse that they can t fix bugs and make the game more fun for certain factions i supported the game to be a full game not be a forever beta due to the recent dlc i can t support it but if they change around and support the game i love i will recommend it again i don t want abandonware
