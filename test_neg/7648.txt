2023 here are my honest thoughts on the game high seas with over 150hours invested into high seas i feel i am in a good position to give an honest and fair review of high seas so here it is high seas players for the most part are pve players looking to enjoy friendly pvp encounters but want to focus on pve content with maximum rewards gained for their valuable time and effort however if the comments in these forums are anything to go off those that would have you believe that the pvp community are lovely people are full of themselves the pvp community in this game is by far the worst i have ever come across even worse than dayz and that s saying something they will constantly shun you and purposefully try to bully you into believing their opinion is the right one and that you are not to be believed nor trusted with your experiences because they themselves have never had a bad one or have good ones every play through this is far from the truth if you load into high seas you can be rest assured that within your first few hours of playing the game you will have some sweat lord roll up on you and do what they do best get toxic verbally abusive to the point of telling you to end yourself and sink you while throwing slurs and abuse your way god only help you if you re a female player because you are going to get called a lot worse and really have some disgusting things said to you this is if they don t chase you across half the map first or you don t manage to run away and scuttle before they get to you high seas to the devs and pvp lords is a perfect game couldn t be fixed and must be played to their pleasure not yours i have spent many hours playing high seas and it has only gotten more toxic since safer seas has come out noting once again in these forums there are a few select people who get confused with pvevp and pvpve the concept is simple pvevp player vs environment vs player while pvp is a concept and component in the game the core focus is pve and the game should theoretically be played as such with the game mechanics facilitating this with pvp elements to your pve gameplay not the other way around as these people love to try to say this game is pvpve it is marketed tagged and sold as a pvevp and unlike the very out of touch select group in these forums having played my last hs session today i can tell you this entire statement is accurate having been minding my own business and rolled up on by a sweat lord sworn at called a coward told to go end yourself edited because the 3 letter acronym is banned text go play ss if you don t want pvp loser this is the type of gameplay they will try to tell you doesn t exist or rarely happens you re just unlucky but the truth is it happens more often than they will admit and if they say it doesn t they re probably the ones instigating it with their entire argument backed by its called sea of thieves or you got a pvpve game its what you paid for sad mentality which these people seem to harbour so much saltiness towards the pve player base for some unknown reason but its very sad they are so driven to make the pve player base leave by bullying them out or at the very least conform to their ideology bringing me back to the whole pvevp meaning and what the game is actually marketed as compared to how the game is actually played safer seas oh let s talk about this game mode it was wrongly advertised and wrongly marketed as a place where people who enjoy the aforementioned pvevp can go to really enjoy their experience of player vs environment and not be punished for it however we have seen a couple of moderators and players tell us this game mode serves as a tutorial for hs and if that is the case should have been marketed as one in the first place before people spent real money on a game to play a game mode that failed to deliver in its initial concept marketed purpose since this game mode has come out these forums have exploded with many many players expressing their sincere displeasure with this mode and how it has been delivered attempting to give honest constructive and genuine feedback to the moderation team and as stated in a statement from rare this team works directly with them the devs in the hope that they would listen to this feedback and act in the best interest of their player base and not their own selfish desires however this has been the case where we have now seen the admin team forming a single minded agenda based response system copying and pasting responses shutting down threads that tell them they are doing a bad job and like myself banning people who speak out more harshly against this type of despicable behaviour the feedback given should of been welcomed but instead we have been told that unlike every other game on the market the devs will not adapt to their player base and will instead stick their heads in the sand and wish it all went away by censoring and silencing people who speak out against it let s get this out there while this game mode might be enjoyed by a small handful of pve players who like to play with their families or may have special access needs this game mode is not enjoyed by the majority of pve players for its simple yet obvious attempt at giving the pve community the middle finger by cutting profits rewards taking away captained ships blocking voyages and more the attempts to silence people and delete their comments only go to show that anyone who does not agree with the dev s failed vision of a pvp only game will be silenced like many others i have spent real world money on this game and in the epic store buying skins etc helping to keep the community the player base and the game alive not to mention pay these devs mods bills i am sincerely appalled at the moderators and the dev team for their actions in silencing people for having opposing views that may shine a light on their actions and calling them out for it in an age where censorship is the only way to enforce your point it is disturbing to see it happening here too i have compiled and will continue to compile video evidence of the censorship taking place on these forums which may make a great video one day who knows all i know is if you have read this far and are considering buying this game i would carefully think about your valuable real world coin because if you do and are hoping the game will be a welcome place where you can act like a pirate but have fun in the game you may want to think again the support structure in place both in these forums and at rare will not support any grievance you have pvp tickets raised for toxic behaviour go unaddressed and you had better not have an opposing view to that of the game devs or stand from under because you re in for hell if you do if the devs truly cared about the game and their vision they would listen to their community and adapt accordingly take fortnite for example it listens to its community and adapts to the times giving its players what they ask for because of it they make millions of dollars a week estimated 8billion in 2023 from 6 billion in 2022 and are one of the most successful games running for many years now if the devs want to look at successful game models fortnite is one along with many others and paying attention to what s working and what isn t for your community is how you run a successful business game it s really that simple i know that i will cop a lot of abuse from these select group of players in these forums against this post however i have said what needed to be said and am not afraid to stick up for what s right and wrong i am no sheep i know this comment post will probably be deleted and probably see me banned again but i have other ways i can get this comment out if so
