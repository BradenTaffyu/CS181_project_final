2021 i will continue to play this game with friends and i will continue to cautiously recommend it to other people i really do enjoy the world the story and the way things generally handle and play out in sea of thieves amassing hoards of gold and doubloons and chests and gems and everything in between is great and satisfying but the one extremely glaring side of the game that i m having a really hard time getting over recently is the pvp there s nothing that feels good about the pvp here if you re a person who doesn t want to delve into how fight other players as efficient as possible you pretty much just throw things at other people and hope they land and you end up on top swords have a 3 hit combo that only continues if you re hitting a player or a pve enemy and can get very frustrating very quickly when fighting another player due to the ability to just spin around each other and keep swinging with no apparent movement speed penalty the eye of reach sniper rifle and pistol at least do as advertised but have the drawback of not being able to precisely aim them due to a lack of a proper sight which is fair honestly my biggest gripe comes from the reasoning behind engaging in pvp is it efficient no is it personally fun and satisfying for me not at all why should i want to engage in pvp aside from maybe getting some achievements or commendations in game achievements done pretty much none even the faction that s supposed to be the bad guys has a limited number of scenarios in which you gain reputation for your emissary for sinking other ships the important bits from the wiki reaper s bones emissaries can gain emissary reputation in the following ways picking up any treasure for the first time stolen and reaper s bones treasure will reward higher reputationplacing any treasure on your ship for the first time stolen and reaper s bones treasure will reward higher reputationkilling other emissary player pirates of any company gives reputation up to 3 times within 10 minutes things that do not give emissary grade reputation for reaper s bones emissaries killing non emissary ship piratessinking any trading company emissary or non emissary ships reputation is given for picking up the broken emissary flags instead essentially what this means is while you re flying the reaper s bones emissary flag collecting stolen treasures and putting them on your ship gets you rep and killing other players that are flying any of the emissary flags can also give rep but only 3 times within 10 minutes so hardcore spawn camping is useless beyond a certain point the great thing is since this faction is has its basis in pvp and stealing and such you can see these ships on your map and what emissary grade they are with reaper s bones i ve used this plenty of times before to plan ahead and avoid people that could possibly pose a problem to whatever voyage i m doing the issue with all of this people don t care they won t fly the reaper s bones flag to benefit from killing you and turning in your broken emissary flag they won t care if you even have an emissary flag or even loot for that matter there s a very unfortunate number of people that will roll up on you rail your ship with no text or voice chat offered and move on doesn t matter if you re minding your own business doing a tall tale if you re a new player who is trying to get used to the game or someone trying to teach a new player and introduce them you ll sink all the same and this all hurts i ve had fantastical experiences with people in this game before such as me and a friend meeting some dude and his wife and we ended up doing multiple skull forts in an alliance bantering with each other and chilling for about 2 hours before they decided to hop off i ve help people with tall tales with their own voyages with fighting krakens and megalodons and skeleton lords the cooperation with random people that you can experience is fantastical but it s so harshly undermined by the dozen or so times i ve invested an hour into a long voyage and been completely and utterly shut down despite offering alliances handing over portions of my treasures or even all of my treasures just so i can continue my voyage and finish it out in peace for the reputation and a fraction of the gold i would ve normally gotten one of the things that s really harping on me as of late is trying to introduce my new and inexperienced friends to the might and magic of doing fort of the damned going and getting all the flames of fate working together and being amped up the entire time then when we re a significant portion of the way through the boss railing on him while he chomps down bananas we hear two cannon shots as two of our masts go down by the time we get down to our ship two people are at the top of our ladders with their swords and pistols ready stopping us from getting back on one of my friends and i try and communicate through voice through text and get no response whatsoever after all of us dying to the crew of mutes i try and hop out of the ferry of the damned and back onto our ship to see what they re up to and if they wanna talk this time i immediately get blown away by one of the new siren weapons and multiple of them come to emote on me as i m dead they went a bit further than some of my other experiences with mute pvpers with the bm and emoting but this is not an uncommon experience an immediate stop to your fun and your mood just because other people could the vocal community continues to shoot themselves in the foot insisting to new players that this is sea of thieves not sea of friends or that s just how things go if you can t handle it go play something else seemingly trying to ward them off rare has added and introduced far too much pve content in that of original set of tall tales the pirates of the caribbean tall tales and their whole suite of 3 new types of pve enemies to expect everyone to be happy with getting thrashed by relentless pvpers as much as i wish it was this isn t a perfect world and you don t have those cool epic interactions of uneasy alliances you have people sailing their brand new ship back to the people that sunk them and fighting again and vice versa getting stuck in this loop until either one crew loses the desire to continue fighting for the treasure or the treasure is sold sea of thieves is an amazing game to play and vibe with friends on chilling and shooting the between islands and voyages and there isn t really another game that offers this to my knowledge we like the sailing and lamenting about going into headwind again and getting struck by lightning and flying off the boat we have a hard time wanting to launch the game and take our chances of running into another one of these crews and that s a real bad feeling to have
