game updated for the dlc and now the game gives me inappropriate activity detected and refuses to play online steam deck no mods total bs others are having the same issue and no word from fromsoftware updating my review although the company really should have thought of this the installation of the base game leaves out an empty file folder named dlc that the anti cheat looks for so unless you bought the dlc you can t play online dumb you have to manually create the folder and put it in the right place then the anti cheat sees all the files look normal and allows online play leaving the review the same until fromsoft fixes this
