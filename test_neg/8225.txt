2021 this game has everything it needs to be amazing there s definitely no lack of content and the overall mechanics and level design of the game are solid it s a game i desperately want to love but i just can t it s just ruined by major issues that are so silly to me one of which is quality of life your inventory is so ridiculously limited and hard to manage in general in contrast to the immense number of things in the game most of those things are useless btw honestly a lot of skill in this game is just recognizing how much of what you find is junk or so niche that you shouldn t even bother with it but if you just wanted to have fun well you can t cuz you have no inventory to carry anything but the essentials speaking of which trying to have fun and experiment mostly just results in you dying let me tell you this game is so painfully slow that the comedy of your death does not outweigh the frustration of having to restart all over again this game isn t so much hard as it is you just progress so slow and die so fast it s not like you need to pull any crazy technical stunts i mean you don t even have a dash or sprint but if you aren t ultimately cautious all the time you can just drop in a second the oppressive difficulty and inventory constraints of this game make no sense with the vast amount of content that you could potentially experiment with you just end up doing the same thing every game cuz you literally have to to survive i just don t get it if you mod it i m sure you could turn it into a 10 10 game but as it is vanilla it s just not good i think for the first 10 20 hours you will enjoy it because your having fun learning what all the spells do and stuff but when you realize how limiting the game actually is in terms of what you should be doing to win and how you can t do anything fun because you don t have the inventory patience to backtrack it will probably kill you anyway you start disliking it more and more over time
