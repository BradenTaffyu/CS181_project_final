dragonsplague is the best way to infuriate anyone who s spent hours playing the game the mechanic is thus subtle warning that a pawn may be infected or who knows you re imagining it well guess what if you have an infected pawn and go to an inn to rest mind you the inn is an auto save mechanic that will replace all other saves well the moment you wake up every npc in the town is dead killed by your infected pawn no you didn t get to fight back no there s no fixing it unless you have a ton of wakestones so in summation the game punishes you for having pawns
