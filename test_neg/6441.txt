2021 a fundamentally fun game that is the best of its kind simply because there is no competition after playing for a week the game loses its horror charm and it literally just becomes a game of cat and mouse with frequent annoyances like broken hitboxes and unbalanced perks these things could be fixed in a few patches but apparently the devs think its more important to make bad changes to the ui and animations that literally nobody asked for tldr fun game but wouldn t recommend until devs get their sh t together
