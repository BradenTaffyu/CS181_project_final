review contains mega spoilers obviously tldr after putting a decent chunk of time into this game i honestly can t recommend spending 70 on it the combat is incredibly fun before you start out leveling everything but that s really the only thing that kept me going for as long as i did exploring the world is fun for awhile until you realize that there are very few dungeons that are unique or creative in any way the vast majority of places you discover are a small cave ruin with a few saurians goblins bandits around along with a few chests that contain nothing notable the main story of this game is basically non existent after the first act or what i would assume is the first act since it feels like a second act was cut altogether and a third act started and ended almost immediately the dragon has absolutely zero build up throughout the story and then just kind of shows up at the end like he forgot about us the whole time and was sitting at home like oh dang i m supposed to fight the arisen today overall this game feels like it s in early access or a combat demo with a really big map i put hundreds of hours into ddda on the 360 so it s honestly pretty crushing to realize that the sequel i ve been wanting over a decade is just a shell of what it could have been this just goes for me personally but for me to only put 80 hours into an open world rpg that i was excited for is unheard of for me even starfield got 170 hours out of me after launch and i was disappointed in that game overall as well combat the combat in this game is by far the best thing about it and it s not even close i really enjoyed all the vocations yes even trickster and feel like they all bring something unique to the table a little less so with sorc which felt mildly gutted compared to mage and it s previous iteration in ddda and synergize well with each other the addition of things like ragdolls stagger and take downs add many different and often hilarious ways to take down enemies by yourself or together with your pawn the addition of being able to stand on large monsters also opens up the combat a great deal allowing almost any vocation to be able to effectively mount large monsters the small monster variety in this game is not great but in my opinion the different variants of them behave differently enough to make them not all feel like simply reskins overall the combat systems in this game and how they allow you and the monsters interact with each other and the environment feel amazing and are incredibly fun story npcs the main story in this game is honestly painful to even think about i don t think i can even say it s bad and that s because it barely even exists there s not much of the story that s complete enough to actually critique in any meaningful way but here goes i guess the first act of the game vermund starts off really promising you escape from your gulag and make it to the capital where brant tells you that you re the true arisen and that queen regent disa has installed a false arisen on the throne you re then tasked with sneaking into the castle and surrounding areas in the first few quests to find proof of disa s misdeeds expose her as a fraud and convince the people that you are the true arisen sounds like you ve been set up for plenty of juicy political intrigue with some fun cloak dagger shenanigans right wrong when brant tells you you ll have to sneak into the castle under the cover of darkness what that really means is you re going to stroll into a side door walk right down the main hallway past all the guards and through the castle like you work there pick up a scrap of paper and jump out a window another one of these quests has you breaking a political ally out of jail and even gives you the key surely you ll have to sneak past the guards whose only job is to keep the prisoners in prison right nah just walk right in unlock the cell right in front of them hoist og over your shoulder like a sack of grain and walk right out easy peasy they really made the first few quests in the main story stealth based and then added no stealth mechanics to the game whatsoever the npcs you re sneaking around have no agency whatsoever and couldn t give less of a crap about who you are or what you re doing in the castle the only thing they re thinking about is whether or not they ll have a nice tipple before bed this isn t unique to lowly guard npcs either it s everyone if any of the big players in the main story are standing around somewhere that you can get to you can just walk right up to them and they ll just give you an oblivion npc line about the weather or something anyway you go through these stealth missions and gather your evidence and allies and then all of it leads to nothing absolutely nothing you learn of the godsway and phaesus disa s partner in crime and then the story pivots to finding phaesus and the entire disa plotline is forgotten about altogether so now we re off to battahl to find phaesus and learn more about the godsway here s where i would talk about the second act if there was one we re in battahl now and we re unknowingly a few quests from the game ending here s where nearly all sense of narrative or continuity completely flies out the window we learn of the forbidden magic research lab and are tasked with finding a way in so we can learn about the godsway so naturally we just follow the road signs to the super secret and mysterious lab walk right in the front door and find what we re looking for before leaving nice now we re off to find a man named ambrosius who phaesus has tasked with finding special blue crystals which are used to create godsway crystals which can control minds we know this because when we find ambrosius he just tells us exactly what they re doing why and to what end he then asks if we d like to help him out in exchange for some gold to which we agree from then on the game frames things as if we are working with for phaesus at this point it feels like the story completely falls apart in every way i m not gonna go into the ending of the game in great detail but from this point it s basically bada bing bada boom dragon just kind of shows up and you to your thing game over you can fight the dragon but you re probably going to kill it in less than three minutes then ironically the true ending is to not fight the dragon at all after all this you finally get to the endgame which is a sort of boss rush that leads into the last cutscene there are plenty of powerful monsters around the map in this section of the game which would lead one to believe it to be this game s version of the everfall or bitterblack in which you can repeatedly battle farm these powerful monsters to your heart s content well turns out you only have a couple days worth of time to enjoy this there are ways to stay here but the game is clearly designed for you to complete the game and ng as soon as possible once here in summary you go through the first act and meet a few main and side characters that you assume are going to be interesting and important down the line and then they just aren t a few of them like ulrika who is on the cover of the game mind you and wilhelmina have one or two more side quests and then you never see them in the main story again nadinia also top billed the empress of battahl the country with long standing ties to vermund is a completely optional npc when it comes to the main story disa the first antagonist just says yeah whatever man in the end and she s done then you and the homie phaesus take a walk and the dragon shows up done 5 10 and like 3 of those 5 points are the combat sadge
