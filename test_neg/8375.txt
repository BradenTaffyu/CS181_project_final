2022 a game that loves to punish you instead of rewarding and if that s your thing you re welcome to buy it the gameplay is incredibly fun the game engine itself is unique and impressive along with it s stoner music it s a great experience until you re dead for the 50 000 time the game is incredibly unfair i m fine with a game punishing you if make mistakes but you ll die even if you ve been the most careful and calculated as you could random exploding items wands that kills you if you try them once massive amounts of enemies that comes out of the dark from all directions and you won t be a able to see with many rouge lites it s common to die a lot but each time you play again you ll get better and get better items i ve played 70 hours so far and the game rewarded me almost to none you ll hear the quote after you play it 100 hours it s going to be great but why to wait such an insane amount of hours to get good with 70 hours you ve already beaten most rouge lites by now like binding of issac enter the gungeon risk of rain and such why couldn t this game be more rewarding with much less time invested in it with dying for the most part there are many secrets and the world is huge but should you really spoil the game for yourself by watching guides on the internet for the game s fault being obscure i m not sure about it and yeah exploration would reward you with death for 99 of the cases in it s core it s a good game but the amounts of fruastration and time wasted on it doesn t feel worth buying it
