2022 this is another instance of where i wish that steam offered a in the middle option issues lacking much content leaderboards challenge viewer stats menu i am sure more that i cannot think of menus are hard to navigate and everything feels hidden the ui is overall pretty atrocious and not user friendly no idea why they didn t stick with mw2019 s ui it was good and usable crashes oh my god the crashes three crashes thus far during multiplayer 15 20 crashes during the campaign from a bug that has existed at least in vanguard if not longer that is clearly not fixed and just moving on into this game complete and utter lack of optimization the menus are basically always frozen textures constantly are popping or low res in menus everything in the menus is lagging removal of red dots on minimaps and the changes to the perk system mid campaign pros feels a lot like mw2019 which was the best one since bo2 imo so much weapon customization that it is crazy also the ui makes it hard to track unlocks and what guns unlock other guns and ugh just the ui ttk feels good maps are alright i would prefer shooting range and some of the other mw2019 maps over ones for this game but they aren t the worst i ever played overall the game is definitely a 5 6 outta 10 right now the steam reviews are at a 64 positive and i think that is a fair score there is so much weighing this game down update i do think s1 made many improvements to the game but it still in a rough state and needs a ton more work
