2019 product received for free dead by daylighta game blighted by the ugliness of its community which can at times overwhelm the experience rating 5 10purchased cost freedead by daylight is a difficult game to review if you were to review dead by daylight at its best it is a thrilling cat and mouse between the killer and the survivors at its worst it is a nasty experience filled with people who are all too willing to create the most toxic environment they can whilst the developers haven t promoted this toxicity they also have done very little to counteract it which has allowed it to fester within the community the entire game was crafted around the concept that survivors are unable to communicate outside of the two silent gestures included in the game and various other ingenious ways that people find to communicate to include anything else would fundamentally break the game in a way that can t easily be fixed which makes it even more baffling as to why the developers then allowed the inclusion of survive with friends swf which allows you to play as a team using third party communication to completely flip the tables on the killer and experience the game in a way that it was never designed for i can understand they wanted to sell more copies of the game and needed a way for people to play together but the way they have implemented it is perhaps the second biggest issue the game faces and also one of the principal reasons behind the main issue of toxicity dead by daylight a screenshot of dead by daylight by harv then comes the stale gameplay there have been numerous patches and dlc packs released yet most games at the higher ranks as survivor you ll be facing the same killers using the same meta perks whilst the killers will face the same looping and generator rushing gameplay that has always existed along with the new survivor meta you ll rarely come across anything different and if you want to experience different gameplay you need to drop into the lower ranks which also brings its own problems this then brings us onto the overpriced cosmetics and the vast array of expensive dlc which also plagues the game there is an argument that most of the dlc is available for free if you are willing to grind however the time required and rewards so pitiful you are better spent buying them and you will need to buy them if you want to run the current meta for both killer and survivor require you to own certain dlc or be lucky enough that they appear on the shrine for free whilst you have enough shards to pick them up dead by daylight a screenshot of dead by daylight by harv it feels as though serious work needs to be taken to fix the big issues the game is currently facing but looking at the way things have progressed i can t see anything changing in the immediate future one change the game needs is fairly straightforward and easy to implement to start with they need to disable the end game chat people are willing to sit in a full game after they ve been killed for twenty minutes just to abuse the killer player i would go as far to say that they should implement an anonymous system where you can t see who you are playing against but that brings forward potential problems about reporting players for cheats and exploits they also need to start running more events that change the game for a short period of time we ve seen two killers in games with the most recent exploit they should run a one month summer event where they mix things up these are things the community are finding a way to do that the developers could utilise something completely different but a timed event that enables them to revert back to the original gameplay afterwards there s so much potential in dead by daylight sadly potential i can t see the developers ever quite realising
