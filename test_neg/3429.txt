2022 i can no longer recommend this game in good faith with the gta online portion after being suspended after 300 hours of playing the game and grinding away at the agency auto shop and heists and just enjoying the game with a band of friends losing my character with all the progress i made when i have done nothing wrong except literally going to bed one day and waking up to see i ve been suspended now i outright fear even going onto the game even after the suspension is gone in a month along with my other friends and never being able to play again the policy that is in place where one is not allowed to appeal a suspension or a ban is absolutely insane and i know there are other innocent players that have been getting false flagged by their overly zealous anti cheat but due to their policy anyone who plays legit and gets flagged or even sabotaged by a modder cannot do anything about it but accept their fate of losing all their progress the first time and than condemned to just never play again the second time they get flagged one can go onto youtube reddit or even check other reviews here on steam on this matter they ve basically shut down the customer service over the phone and if you respond on their support questioning your suspension you just get the same copy pasted message and your requests locked even speaking to a live service rep via their website just results in you immediately getting the same thing and them closing out the chat you won t even get to know why you were suspended banned as they stated they will not release any information on why action was taken against you
