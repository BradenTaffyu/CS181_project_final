2023 this is the grossest example of overinflated pricing based on a 20 year old reputation for a product that isn t even close to playable the game is almost a year old and is more unstable than when it launched not to mention the fact that lobbies are dead and filled with npcs to give the illusion of an actual player base at least the actual player base has something in common with the npcs they are all completely brain dead if you have any sense at all please save yourself the money frustration and humiliation that comes with paying any dollar amount for this bottom of the barrel cash grab money farm this game has no soul this franchise has no soul and the developers 100 do not have any souls anybody who defends this game has a sub 60 iq and deserves to be mocked publicly thank you 0 10
