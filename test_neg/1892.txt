2022 tldr don t buy lots of bugs that ca seem reluctant to fix plus pricing is a problem original review posted july 2022 see bottom of review so its been almost a year since i wrote my short review to answer any questions about performance it has improved greatly it s still not the best but it is miles better than it was for me at least as for pricing i stand with the larger community ca have tried to push a price hike to make up for their predicted losses whilst their other projects are in the works that s not the communities issue and should not be expected to cover that predicted loss is the game worth buying in short i feel it is not tww2 is a better game with far more polish at this time buy that and any dlc at a key site on sale and you ll have a blast furthermore there has been very little in terms of bug fixing including a long list of issues that really break any positives i could raise in this review the following is a comment from the tw subreddit listing a few of the major issues that dev leads seem to not be willing to fix a year after they were reported for me it feels pointless to even consider purchasing dlc when the base game is in a state like this most of these have been reported countless times and are often marked as a known issue for many months to spread awareness in the playerbase customerbase of the critical core long standing bugs issues in tww3 here are the ones i know of campaign map ai utterly sucks unable to put up a proper fight build upgrade up its armies or effectively develop its empires diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy ai in all ways forms is beyond awful especially around vassals and alliances ai is bugged limited in its perception of nearby faction ai is literally not aware what factions are nearby no diplomatic contact unit pathing in manual battles especially cities with construct able barricades is awful units refusing to path through broken city gates destroyed city walls instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up exhaust themselves cavalry monsters getting models stuck which pulls back the whole unit into death units dropping forgetting orders even in the middle of pitched melee combat units not shooting because they are moving fast while being stationary units unable to shoot despite having clear line of sight battle maps being broken for pathing and losight especially on top of wall crenelations auto resolve insists on damaging killing single entity monsters and especially artillery pieces even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1 auto resolve still gives cities a ridiculous advantage even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1 certain units lords heroes fail to properly do their charging attack units especially large ones will randomly die when attacking certain walls gates or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger units even lords on foot will randomly die when climbing ladders some lords cathay dragons especially just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time ai does not understand nor properly react during the defence of siege battles it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force ai charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death especially lords heroes like belakor ai clueless about properly using aoe magic magic in general which also makes anything anti magic rather useless hundreds of bugs related to skills techs items unit abilities stats building mechanics etc etc sometimes two characters lords heroes will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map permanently preventing them from movement and interaction item qualities being nonsense with common ones often being better than rare special ones lord hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones wochaos revive norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by ca because they could not be bothered to properly fix it manual battle ai will sometimes simply not activate instead its units refuse to attack defend move seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defensive battles countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords heroes do not work properly ai occasionally able to see your ambush hidden armies from across immense distances react to their positioning skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger react causing the ranged unit to just stand still ai will often prioritize targeting sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership fleeing unit especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord squads of large sized ranged units like salamander razordon hunting packs after finishing a move order will take forever to wiggle around before actually firing confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics skaven etc will often start at zero loyalty confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts confederated legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait meaning their next death is permanent completely non functional mechanic for automatic development of cities everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked ai lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation bugs related to construct able objects on defensive maps where units get stuck in barricades or cannot attack them fresh bugs like bretonia damsels wood elf ariel nakai unit recruitment etc etc black ark unique map army spawn positions again bugged after it was fixed in late twwh 2 black ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby dark elf armies bugs out when the black ark is garrisoned in a city ai will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly but not yet at war factions which are still surrounding that location from the previous turns razing ai will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force instead of fighting where its chance is best inside the capitol some sea objects like islands treasure skull carcass will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop ai will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering overpowering the garrison 5 to 1 and auto resolve showing certain defeat for the players city various lord hero equip able ancillaries that fail to work properly vampire count coast ui for showing raise dead pool possibilities near city bar ui does not show units recruit able from battle casualties certain unique cathay caravan rewards are again inaccessible despite being fixed in some previous patch such as the vampire weapon there is a limited number of names for generic lords heroes and once they have all been used up the game notifications will start showing nonsense mixing up factions names icons etc 20 mins played with very poor performance it s difficult to understand why they made changes to the engine when wh2 looked great 3080ti and 7900k for reference it s a shame because the game is unplayable on the campaign map with less than 10fps unless i am zoomed right in fyi i did not pay full price for the game edit will likely follow if i get this working well enough cannot recommend at this time
