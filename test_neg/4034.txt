2017 i got this game with my friends and we played it quite a bit but after a while it gets really boring and you start to realize that it s just a massive grindfest that isn t really fun open play was not enjoyable not only because of the scriptkiddies running around wrecking everything but also because just about everyone else in the servers were hostile with every new update that adds content you start to realize that the prices of the new content get higher and higher so you would either need to grind mod buy shark cards in order to enjoy the new content but we all know they just want you to buy the shark cards that s why they ve done away with the modding because as long as people are cheating in money they can t make a quick buck honestly i loved this game but it just gets really stale i wanted to like it i really did but it s apparent that take two just want your money
