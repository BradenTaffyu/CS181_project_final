2020 playing dbd is like being in an abusive relationship there are genuinely good times you can remember them they were great fun but as time continues to tick on you realize how unhappy playing this game makes not only you but everyone else around you it s some sort of weird purgatory where people knowingly hate the game yet still play it as if they can t shake dbd out of their system or something these are people firmly in the loop that dbd provides it gives you just enough to keep you in but you re firmly aware of how much you hate it the entire time will that stop you probably not welcome to the abuse reconsider your time before playing this i promise you there s better expenditures of your time
