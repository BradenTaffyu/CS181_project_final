why won t you let me like you if there was one sentence to define this game it would be that there s so much here that just begs to be enjoyed exciting the mind with possibilities and fun yet just when you re hitting that groove the game hits you with a right hook designed to make you regret purchasing it i want to recommend this game i ve enjoyed dozens of hours with this game but it would be absolutely irresponsible to not front load any review with the mind numbing dredgery this b tier rpg is more than willing to lampoon its players with because there s no other way to describe it the game will just outright bend you over sometimes perhaps its due to bugs perhaps the quests wind up failing themselves before you even get to interact with them the number of times you ll be interrupted when focusing on something will get to some people while the wildly shifting difficulty might get others expect your companions to fail you whether its because their pathfinding breaks or they just don t follow orders correctly its pick your poison planning around their screw ups is more optimal than trying to stop them same could be said for the npcs and their unending escort missions know now that most are optional so never feel inclined to do them for anyone you don t care about i d ramble more about the bugs or the utterly baffling methods of monetization but those have been talked about to death and are honestly just a small portion of what damages the game s longevity if you re the type of player who can overlook all of that then you ll find a decently entertaining rpg underneath the story s neither good nor bad more of just a skeleton for you to chart your adventure through some love it others hate it but the gameplay is the saving grace from either camp combat ranges from good to stellar in places but your mileage will vary drastically given the range of classes available the selection is an unquestionable downgrade from what the prior game offered but whats here is serviceable given the length of the game you could get dozens of hours of entertainment out of it but i m not convinced most people wouldn t get more out of playing something else if you re determined to get it then please wait for a sale you owe it to yourself and your hard earned money
