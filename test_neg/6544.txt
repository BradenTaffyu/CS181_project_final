if you ever thought warframe didn t respect your time don t touch this with a ten foot pole worst grindfest i ve ever witnessed also for the wf vets imagine a game in wich you have to forma every slot 10 to have and endgame build because all mods costs like 12 16 units and that it locks you with this build preventing build flexibility because all slots have polarities then consider the fact levelling to max each time it s a warframe copy pasta system wise takes 3x the time it takes in wf no trading no ducats no way to earn ingame currency caliber and buy character slots only solution is to buy from the shop if you are f2p warframe will give you much more in return for your time if you are an average heavy spender you d have much better time playing destiny 2 the game has its perks though nice shiny ue5 graphics clean but kinda souless tho boss fights colossi are not bad stealth is nowhere near what warframe can offer in this department tfd is young so i guess it may deserve a second look in a year or so to check how it evolved it s nexon though so i got my doubts
