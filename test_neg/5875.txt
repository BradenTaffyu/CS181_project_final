2017 this game is absolutely amazing the mechanics are very unique and fun to use the feeling when breaching through a wall and killing everyone all of this is great however the one let down is the community just because of the community i cannot recommend this game to any players playing in asian servers the community is extremely toxic the community is so unbelievably toxic that i have stopped playing r6s for a while i am only level 40 which is enough for teammates to call me a noob and kick me if my teammates don t kick me when i get 4 kills or aces i always get called a hacker noob and get kicked i cannot believe how toxic the asians are they have pushed me to the point of playing less and less i wish people like myself who absolutely despises the asian r6s community to be able to play in american server gameplay 10 10community 1 10
