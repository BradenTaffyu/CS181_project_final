2019 i didn t bother with single player and multiplayer is pretty dead i mainly got my hours from zombies and the workshop maps don t pay 44 99 its not worth it try and get it cheap somewhere else instead instant gaming has a pretty good price oh yeah make sure you buy the zombies chronicles dlc if you only plan on playing the zombies mode the vanilla map is not noob friendly
