2017 this game use to be good used to be good when the game started everything was fairly priced however with every update if feels like they are trying to scam you more and more last 4 5 major updates have added new bunkers hangers causing the amount to go up a ton not to mention that the game has a bill system so everyday in game it takes some cash from you with all the new buildings constantly being added it beings to quickly drain your cash adding up to be almost 2000 dollars it sounds small but it adds up really quick another issue coming up with it is that things are becoming way too over priced for any average person a few years ago you could buy the best house and the best car for only 25 real bucks now you can buy 100 bucks worth of shark cards and be barely be able to buy anything then to top it all off rockstar recently took millions away in cash not only from be but other players too then have the balls saying you wanna buy overpriced virtual crap this game has become nothing is reasonable for a casual player to get and its hard to start off as almost everything is behind a pay wall or grind for hours upon hours for a tiny amount of cash save your money and buy something better
