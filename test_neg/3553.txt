2015 the game itself is a masterpiece every server seems to have someone modding though to make the experience cancerous though tbh they tend to kill everyone and make it look like other people are doing the modding so that they get banned sometimes they ll give you money which is good or bad depending on if you want to play legit or not the company itself y know it s cool that the dlc is free and everything however the game was much better optimized at release when gotten gains started it started causing many if not everyone performance issues also rockstar was originally banning people for using singleplayer mods which was a move by rockstar in fact i believe most negative reviews on this game is because people have been banned for using singleplayer mods such as the fov mod grand theft auto v itself is easily a 8 9 or even 10 10 game in most reviews the ai is amazing esspecially the cops in this game the visuals of this game are incredible it has a good story and unlike past grand theft autos three main characters each with there own unique personality the voice acting is great it has a good story and it s so fun to playthrough it however that s the game itself multiplayer lobbies as i said are trash with hackers and poor optimization most of the games community is very aggresive and modders hackers everywhere the fun in missions heists races etc can easily be spoiled in some way such as doing a heist and somebody decides to leave it s over the heist will end and you ll have to find someone else this game is very difficult for me to review because this is one of my favorite games it s just due to rockstar and some of the community to make the experience annoying i feel that because after everyone beats grand theft auto v and goes to gta online though i d have to give it a negative review considering that is what everyone is going to be doing aside from singleplayer modding or whatever they ll be doing so negative review from me
