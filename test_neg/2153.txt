2023 s s s s i really really want to recommend this game but the state it is in at this very moment i cannot the concept is amazing and i adore all the cute animals along with the cosmetics that are out and the collabs they ve done visually it is a really good a cute cartoon y game where you get to be a stuffed animal unfortunately the community is already incredibly toxic and the game hasn t even been out more than two weeks i am a girl and i feel like i am in a cod lobby by the amount of hate i get when speaking it is very common to get cussed out in games and called slurs because you knocked somebody out or are just playing that game the way it is meant to be played or because you sound like a girl if i get told to make one more sandwich i am going to put laxatives in it you would think with the game being about really cute stuffed animals the community would be nice and welcoming but it s not you can argue that i should just mute the voice chat or just ignore it but the game was made with voice chat and i enjoy interacting with the wholesome section of this community the ones that are just trying to have fun and don t threaten to un alive you for knocking them out and the game play i could write an entire review just about this you can pick up a weapon and it is pretty much game over for everyone else without a weapon unless the weapon holder is miraculously knocked out or they run out of stamina if you get nun chucks or a shovel then it is almost impossible to get close enough to that person to knock them out especially on maps like the alligator river or airplane because those are not at all forgiving and one misjudged jump is the end i think weapons should have some type of cool down or some type of durability at least there should be no reason a single cat with a pair of nun chucks can knock out eight people in a row and win the game simply because they were the first person to pick up a weapon it is ridiculous speaking of being knocked out what is the point in playing when people can just stand over you and continuously knock you out there have been many times where somebody is upset and targets me or another person and tries to keep them knocked out for the entirety of that game and it is incredibly frustrating to stand up only to be drop kicked into the shadow realm once again this is just a quality of life request really but they should add something in the game where you can see your own stuffed animal better this would help visually impaired individuals because sometimes you can lose your own character in the chaos of everyone maybe a little glowing outline or something else to better indicate where you are in the group overall i like the concept of this game it is cute and fun with friends but it certainly can be improved if you are looking to buy it i would wait a little while to see if there are any updates update 08 october so they updated the game to make seemingly all of the games 4v4 which is ish imo they should add an option to have 2v2 modes and 4v4 modes that way duos and large groups have options to play together on the same team i think the 4v4 isn t necessarily a bad thing but having a wider range of team sizes that you can select from would be nice update 10 october they reverted back to the 2v2 modes thankfully update 23 november just updating this for the steam awards for the better with friends catergory but i think that the changes the devs are implementing soon will definitely help the game
