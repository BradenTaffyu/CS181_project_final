2019 i really wish i could recommend this game but i can t not because of ubisoft servers or balancing issues and whatnot but i cannot possibly recommend this game s community i am not a ranked player and rarely play ranked gamemodes in any game and have only been ranked once in rainbow six that being said i only play casual and i can t even play 2 3 games in one sitting without becoming extremely burnt out due to the toxicity and ridicule laid out by this community i find myself extremely stressed in every game i play because of how this community treats low skill players like myself this game is by no means beginner friendly and every mistake minor mistake you make will cause at least one person in the game to harass you for the rest of the match i only come back to this game for the exciting and enjoyable gameplay itself but i am constantly turned away by its unrelenting community
