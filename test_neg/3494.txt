2016 so when i bought this game on the xbox 360 at launch and then later pc at launch i loved this game until somehow at rockstar decided that the grind isnt hard already and make it even more harder for people to get new content oh let me release a new car that costs almost the retail price of this game if we look to ea s starwars game they got so many backlashes on the community but rockster is getting away with this i feel that rockster destroyed their own master piece after years if you look in a buisness way this is a great way for making an money printer also because servers are expensive but sadly i started to get fustraded and decided to glitching money in the game what ofcourse resulted to a ban and purging 3 4 years of gameplay sure this is my own fault but their anti cheat system is not perfect forexample i ve heard alot of storys that innocent people got banned and their account purged and customer support gave a big middle finger to you this did happen to some of my friends even cheaters have an way to get you banned and rockstar wipes your account so this is my honest review after rewriting it after a rage attack 2 years ago i still cannot recommend this game at all maybe the singleplayer content yes but online no stay far away from this game now even with the new free dlc it feels like they re no longer put much efford into the game sure its a 5 year old game but still rockstar trys you to milk you from your monney and i feel that gta online is there to milk you from money until you re bone dry oh dont let me started if you didnt bought for example an nightclub moterclub company etc if you dont you re getting constantly nagged with phonecalls you cannot deny that says that you need to buy one
