2020 i really wished there was a neutral review option since that s my review atmbasically speaking my review is going to be focusing on gta online instead of the singleplayer so look away if that s what you re more interested ingta online is fun don t get me wrong with randoms it can be a bit bad and hectic but if you have some friends to play with or with people you know it can be an absolutely fun experience either doing jobs together or just doing random stuff in free roam as a groupfun is a good big part of the positives but now i m going to share the two major downsides it has1 the grind is obnoxiously hard and rough if you want to get basically anything you have to basically play jobs events constantly to even get to an acceptable enough level where you unlock enough stuff and the second part just makes it worse2 the networking is absolutely horrible sure you can go say your internet is just trash but that wouldn t be much of an issue if gta online didn t use a horrible peer to peer system where it relies on everyone s connection to work properly instead of needing per user connection like a regular dedicated server this causes massive issues with gta online when you re trying to load connect to anything and it wouldn t be so bad if the actual rockstar servers would actually be stable and not constantly make it so you can sometimes can t buy anything due to connection issues
