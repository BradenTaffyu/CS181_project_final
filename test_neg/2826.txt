2017 banned for 1 month as many before me for no reason what so ever after playing 62 hours in a private session with a friend account was reset and there is absolutely no point in ever playing this again called rockstar support and the guy told me laughing that they hear this all the time but they can t do anything and i ll just have to live with it after all in his opinion all of us banned people are hackers and i m apparently a liar for telling him i didn t do anything wrong i was swimming in the ocean towards a boat since they are randomly banning people and not giving a about it rockstar is now dead to me thanks
