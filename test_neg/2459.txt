2021 this game just gets worse by the season skill based matchmaking in this game can and will ruin your day i just love coming home after a tiring day just to get placed against pros whereas my unfortunate teammates have barely made it past the tutorial also almost every season in this game has some sort of balancing crisis where one character or weapon makes everything else obsolete moreover the one thing that respawn and ea have accomplished in this game is developing a new definition of bad server it s almost become a tradition for the servers to become unplayable or for them to crash whenever a new season is released
