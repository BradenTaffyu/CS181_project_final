2023 game is fun some of the time early game takes too long try to speed through and you have no money to buy anything or re roll perks going slow and taking you time means you will find more hidden wands and items but by the time to get to the interesting weapons and perks you have been slogging for almost an hour finding anything interesting or useful is not guaranteed either plenty of people love the game look at the reviews and i did at one point but the tedium is becoming very apparent i think there is a good game buried under there that shows itself every one and a while but the time fun ratio is too off for me tl drearly game is too slow and boring for the amount of times you will be playing it mods might be able to fix but this review page is for the game not mods as a side note the physics of the world kinda become blah after some time a lot of emphasis on things burning and this also takes way to long tons of floating single pixels you will get stuck on you are also apparently wearing a nylon robe soaked in lighter fluid
