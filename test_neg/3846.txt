2017 first i d like to say i bought this game three times once for ps3 on release then ps4 and again here on steam when i finally decided to build a gaming pc this should be a testament to the overall quality of this game s single player alone as i have no real interest in the multiplayer component due to rockstar s and take two s business model and their priorities however that said i have had this game s social club render itself defunct for no reason multiple times every week no matter how many times i reinstall the game and the social club it eventually re breaks for no reason within the week while this doesn t impact the quality of the game itself when it works it very clearly shows how inept rockstar is at making sure this sort of issue doesn t happen 150 aaa games installed on my pc and one has this issue gta5 the music is on point and fits the game and the story very well and each of the three main characters are all well written the story while good feels a bit all over the place at first but i genuinely feel it is due to how much the story seems to just rush what i mean by that is that it seems like things just keep escalating and escalating for the main characters rushing from one crazy event to another to another while it was enjoyable the entire way through that pacing of the story made it feel a little disjointed for me at times despite making perfect sense the ending was also a bit lackluster and felt rushed in a bad way to me an arbitrary a b and c choice with one being a very obvious right choice two choices lead to less satisfying endings and the other leads to an ending that is very clearly a tie up loose ends mission both literally and narratively you kill all of the antagonists you run into in the game in a mission that simply screams we had to wrap it up somehow that said it should be noted i ve beaten the main story four times while it has some very glaring flaws narratively it s still a fun time now on to the multiplayer the reason i m not into it is actually not due to me being primarily a single player focused gamer but also because of how the entire thing is set up i played red dead redemptions free roam multiplayer for hours upon hours and enjoyed it despite it being fairly empty gta online it s even emptier than red dead redemption in order to have any fun whatsoever you need to make in game money you do this by playing deathmatches heists races and various other game modes the problem is that the payouts are so incredibly low that you will need to grind for countless hundreds of hours to get enough money to keep up with the updates and this game while fun is nowhere near good enough to warrant that type of dedication the reason for this is so they can get you to spend literally hundreds of dollars on microtransactions in fact when gtao launched the payouts were actually reasonable and balanced only to be nerfed to insane degrees just to make their shark card sales not only more enticing but make it damn near the only way to legitimately have fun in this game this turns people to script mods that give them hundreds of millions of in game money to circumvent this unethical business model many modders however go further by making themselves invincible invisible can insta kill anyone and do anything you can think of to ruin your fun in response take two put an end to openiv which is literally only used for single player mods like graphics mods that don t even work on multiplayer eventually take two reversed that decision and began allowing openiv to be used again for single player modding however just a couple short months later has take 2 and r stripping a very large number of players of their in game currency they started up an event where warehouse missions which are the best way to make money in the game despite still being abysmally lower than they should be yielded twice as much money people grinded those things from the event s start to finish when the smugglers run dlc hits a large number of them see all of their money whiped everyone who contacts r about this then just gets sent automated cookie cutter responses from their automated system and then ignored seriously and then people wonder why this game has such a severe problem with modders online maybe it s because r actively goes out of its way to screw everyone and as a result gives everyone a valid reason to say your microtransactions i m going to pay a modder 15 for 100m rather than pay r 1 250 for 100m then there s the fact that the only bug fixes r does are gtao money glitches there are still many bugs left over from the ps3 360 release and how r never began work on the three expansions they claimed gta5 s single player was going to get because gtao padding their wallets was more important it s very easy for me to say that i can recommend gta5 s single player but i cannot in good concience recommend gtao if i rated the two parts seperately the single player is a solid 8 10 with the multiplayer being a 4 10 6 10 when with friends at the very most even when you ignore the ethics behind r and take two s decisions
