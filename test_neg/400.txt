2014 i ve held this view of csgo for quite some time but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts i ve been playing cs for many many years starting in the early 2000 s through to present day this time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages enjoying leveling my character in wc3 mods smashing heads in deathmatch surfing backwards long jumping bhopping played in quals for wcg competed in cevo and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments i ve enjoyed cs from 1 1 to 1 6 cz css and also csgo no this does not make me a better player than you and no this does not mean i know everything it simply means that i have spent a lot of time playing different titles of counter strike have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases there are a handful of things that really upset me with csgo and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after i have first played the game these issues i consider to be game breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play i enjoy cs because there is a skill curve if you want to be the best at the game you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent this was certainly true in all other cs games i have played but not csgo csgo feels like it is a game of luck and chance as the game stands it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or mm is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game hitboxes are not lag compensated to follow the model of a player when jumpinghitboxes are not lag compensated to follow the model of a player when crouchinghitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bombaimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag compensatedif you are on 70ms ping in a 64tick server this is how most events will play out you see an enemy jump you shoot the enemy and get no hits you see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle you shoot thin air blood appears and you get a headshot killyou see an enemy standing there you shoot his chest you get no hit and then he crouches instantly you see an enemy standing there you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot because he was crouching on the server you see an enemy shoot first die and get no hits watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof you are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb you crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times slowly one by one you get no hits and die all of these aspects of the game i consider extremely game breaking the fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves yeah that has happened to me on a number of occasions just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed in it s current state the game rewards people for not aiming aka good players in the game need only aim at the ground run and shoot and they ll likely get a headshot because as long as you don t aim at the model that you see there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit the only one of these bugs that existed in counter strike source pre 2010 ob update was the hitboxes on the planting animation an example of a bug that i do not consider game breaking but extremely frustrating is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player for some reason after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this a feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch that is a huge disappointment people standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them but the player s screen will be completely black this was an unintentional meta change when trying to fix one way smokes and this new issue has existed for months now the game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them throw a smoke down wait until it starts to fade teammate resmokes rinse repeat and run down the timer retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can t capitalise on the blind criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible what a horrible meta change why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago 3d sound is non existent in csgo it is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind this game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny i find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems i see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable it d be nice if people were able to draw the dev s attention to these issues and press for a resolution
