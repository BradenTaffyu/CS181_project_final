2023 simply put match making sucks it doesn t recognise the casual i ve got to work a 9 5 and pay taxes players amongst the try hard teenagers who have got nothing better to do other than ask their mum when dinners going to be ready and make sure they put their dirty clothes in the washing machine i ve always enjoyed a cod game i love a bit of pew pew shooter shooter but honestly there s no incentive anymore when it s comes to this franchase i recognise there might be a skill issue but honestly i don t think that should 100 my problem to fix anyway i ve got to go now to make dinner and wash my dirty clothes maybe i ll try again tomorrow because i quite like the gun progression but not when i get beaned by some sweaty git with a battlepass skin and a golden gun it s just stupid
