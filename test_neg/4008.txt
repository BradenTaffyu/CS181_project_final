2017 gta v used to be an amazing game and it still could be there are so many things that you can do or at least that s how it appears at first sight everythime you think you can go do something fun there is a huge pricetag attached sure you can pay for it with in game money but it is insanly expensive and can take weeks of farming cash and jobs just to get enough money they push you to buy in game currency with your own money even though you already purchased the game most likely at full price but now they take it a step too far they are declaring all modding on single player to be illegal however there are still hackers and cheaters running rampant through the online mode most people bought gta v on pc because they would be able to mod it and now it is being taken away so listen even though there is a lot of fun to still be had with this game you need to rebel and dislike the game we the gamers need to show them that it is unacceptable to suddenly take away such a large part of the gaming community
