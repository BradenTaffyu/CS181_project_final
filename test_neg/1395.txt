you block roll a string of 12 attacks with the bosses flailing and jumping and flipping and breaking your target lock you see they ve probably finished their string and try to get in one r1 but little did you know there was an unreactable delayed aoe explosion at the end of the string to punish your attempt to get the tiniest bit of damage or maybe they fling their sword up in the air for twelve seconds and catch you rolling with some absurd clearly designed to with you delay which boss did i just describe most of them the only advancement to your moveset in this game from souls is the ability to jump and almost no enemies use that as a mechanic every weapon art that isn t bloodhound step or raptor is virtually useless against the bosses torrent isn t available for bosses often enough and is often straight up worse than being on foot you don t get to do anything cool the boss just does all the cool to you these bosses would be way more fun in a game that expands what your character is capable of like sekiro nioh or monhun i ve beaten the game four times and just finished the dlc i m not bad at the game they ve just cranked up boss health bars and damage and movesets to an absurd degree and left the player character with the same roll block and attack they ve been using since demon s souls now that i m done with the dlc i ll probably never boot up and replay this game ever again which is a shame i want to love this game it s just too much of a slog to ever do again
