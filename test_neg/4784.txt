2022 game is nice but unplayable right now crashes every 10 minutes impossible to get into more than one consecutive game with my party catastrophic launch avoid right now i will change my review once game is fixed edit game runs fine now stutters microlags also gone with newest nvidia update gunplay feels great i like the progression system audio visuals are very good movement also feels nice to me i actually like it that there is no slide cancelling anymore footsteps are a little to loud and it kinda feels like campers get rewarded too much it s not horrible though but i m still not going to change my review because of the horrible sbmm from hell it has never been this bad i have the same kd every game and kill distribution in a lobby is in 90 of cases sth like 30 25 22 22 20 18 it s just so boring really i will change my review if they change sbmm in casual lobbies after the implementation of ranked queues but my hopes are rather low
