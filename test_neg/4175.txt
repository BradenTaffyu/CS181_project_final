2017 how i enjoyed this game upon launch on the xbox360 i got it as soon as it came out on pc re played through the whole story online was fun for awhile finally modders revitalized my interest in the game the enhanced graphics being able to play as a super hero tethering vehicles together i ve experienced online modding too and most the time it wasn t even that horrible getting tased non stop people flying in cars the bannable yet free money they d often give away none of it made my experience terrible but experiencing these fantastical mods only to have them taken away that is terrible
