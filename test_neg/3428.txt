2015 hackers have completly taken over gta online wouldn t reccomend playing in public sessions until this is fixed otherwise love this game edit almost five years later and the problem is just as bad starting to feel like if you can t beat em join em rockstar clearly doesn t care about how bad this really is almost every lobby is full of hackers blowing up everyone on the map or using god mode they re even able to kick other players out of the online mode entirely do not buy this game for the multiplayer you will only be bombarded with random explosions by cheaters
