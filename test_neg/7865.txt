2021 edit after 100 hours i didn t give up playing i got better at pvp being part of it and more importantly sneakily avoiding it but everything else still stays the same i have just adjusted my expectations and turned off auto voice chat to prevent swearing gankers from filling my kid s ears with profanities as we are being raped and pillaged i would change the recommendation status to recommended if you can handle everything below original review after 3 days of really trying hard to keep my love at first sight feeling alive and to use it to persevere and keep playing in the end it was the very thing that was supposed to make it fun that killed it for me other players pvp sucks if you are solo new player pvp sucks if you are playing with your wife kid or any other person who is not pvp skilled despite my background in pvp games ranging from wow to eve to wot trying to get into this game was a nightmare as i was crippled by both learning curve of the game itself and being outnumbered ganked and constantly interrupted devs made this beautiful world of islands with fantastic visuals atmosphere weather music scary moments of getting attacked by skeletons while digging the treasures on islands and filled it with tall tales storyline quests various voyages serial side quests and messages in bottles aka pieces of maps with lost treasure quicker quests all of which require sailing to and exploring 2 3 islands digging around gathering clues and loot getting lost in the beautiful awesomeness for 2 3 hours and then one of two things happen 1 unwanted pvpa you get jumped by a crew of 2 3 experienced pvpers not to say gankers that suddenly attack you in the middle of your questing not pleasant but oh well it happens b they kill you you respawn on your ship while they are demolishing it soul crushing experience after you spent time customizing it filling with food ammo and materials they kill you again you respawn they kill you again they can keep killing you for as long as they want camping on your ship if they decide to sink your ship then you stop respawning on it and you spawn on a new ship in a random outpost on the map miles away from where you were questing and collecting items you also have an option to scuttle sink your ship while you are a dead ghost to avoid further camp ganking with the same result as above but in both cases c everything you ve collected all the quest stuff you ve got all the loot treasures everything is lost you can t even start the quests again this can be digested once or twice but very quickly it becomes quite frustrating 2 you need to step away for a few minutes wife kids meal time any real life reason that requires that you log off a your entire progress is lost b all you undelivered quest items loot and treasures are gone c all the items from your ship s inventory food ammo planks materials are gone practically your entire game session resets and next time you log in you spawn at the random outpost yeah just like when you died except you didn t or didn t you it doesn t even save your location it doesn t even save your ship s customization nothing groundhog day conclussioni really love this game for what it offers in content but i really hate that it effectively pushes me away all i want is to log in hop on my ship get some stuff done save my progress and get out knowing i will hop in again continue where i left off and keep enjoying this charming world but mindless gankers that are not happy with just taking your stuff and moving on code of pirate honour is on the door of every outpost you wake up at for f k sake and game mechanic invented by some person who should be shot hanged then shot again is making me click uninstall such a shame
