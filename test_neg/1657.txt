the idea of playing warhammer 3 total war is more appealing than actually playing it due to how much of it is still broken for example reinforcements units under ai control can get stuck in ditches at the edge of the map and fail to do anything unless enemy units are drawn over to them units frequently fail to follow orders properly indirect fire units such as mortar teams will decide to walk into melee rather than shoot if the battle map has interesting battlefield features on it such as cliffs the mortar teams for example will also sometimes simply decide not to fire when fire at will is on with enemies in range due to becoming confused by terrain features the same is true for indirect and direct ranged units which get confused by unwalkable terrain you want them to shoot over which causes them to start shuffling around when you desperately need them to shoot something ordering faster melee units to disengage has always been something of a pita which has not changed as you constantly need to babysit them spam clicking to get them to move properly direct firing units like handgunners are particularly painful to try to command as obstructions will easily result in them not firing such as very slight elevations in terrain you cannot see unless you zoom in closely or terrain features messing them up whilst this could also be an issue on 1 2 i ve found it is particularly bad in 3 during sieges attacking the enemy gates can result in your units getting trapped or cut in half due to the gates opening and closing this a problem for obvious reasons i never recall having this issue with 1 2 even if the gate is opened i remember my units not crossing the threshold unless i tell them to or have them attack a unit on the other side of it the balancing in general is all over the place and new dlc factions are blatantly more powerful than others also enjoy seeing units on the campaign map and being given quests to recruit units you can t due to not owning said dlc it is almost like ca are trying to compete with paradox interactive in terms of how much hate they can get for their dlc practices the load times in ie are not great though that is somewhat forgivable due to the size of the map the same is true of the ai taking their turn in the campaign map until factions start dying off what is also understandable i ve repeatedly tried to give wh3 a try after enjoying 1 and 2 but for some reason the game fundamentally just does not play well i did not play multiplayer but its possible you might have more fun with that on flat grassy plains maps with much less chance of your units getting confused and knowing your opponent has to deal with the same issues with their units that you do i want to enjoy the game but the gameplay never meets expectations due to all of the issues above
