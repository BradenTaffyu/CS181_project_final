great graphics mediocre game play there s a lot of artificial difficulty you will run into invisible walls your entire play through many bosses have unavoidable cutscene grabs that do damage combat is basic and reminiscent of the first ninja gaiden unfortunately not nearly as fun combat as ninja gaiden hit boxes on many bosses are goofy and lazily made you find yourself chest to chest as close the character box will allow and still attacks won t reach an entertaining game overshadowed by the frustration of issues games have long since fixed looks great plays poor
