2021 barely playable but not because it s poor quality yeah reinstalled to try to get into a match dead game is dead 40k players in china maybe what it is a battle royale focused around melee combat rather than guns this is actually a lot more entertaining than you would think with movement being a big part of the gameplay gameplay a very combo heavy methodical combat which requires you to be on your toes constantly especially when fighting multiple enemies at once movement skills are a must quick inputs and good timing are necessary it s to the walls at all times difficulty skill ceiling is not visible graphics pretty good they aren t the best or groundbreaking but you won t be disappointed by them by any means personally i like my frames so i run them low audio fantastic 360 degree immersive sound replay value depends how far your patience goes this game is a true test of it what i like the combat is unique the gameplay is fast paced the animations are smooth everything is here for this game to be really nice and unique and fun to play what i don t nerfed a large portion of the games movement via scale rush and haven t address any of the realistic balance problems the game has i don t even have fun anymore every single match in gold v to gold i and back down again is just a bunch of sea sweatlards and it s ruining the na gameplay not to mention local leaderboards are broken because of cn players using vpns rip to being 1 in my state since randomly one day an asian player was at the top shrug leaderboards are infested with boosters using new accounts friends to drop elo and farm improper teaming within asian teams is common at higher ranks they like killing nas hitboxes are buggy both because of latency netcode and because they aren t very accurate parry has reached a state of full uselessness there is no proper ranked system for matches you ll be matched with silvers in plat and plats in bronze it literally is just a clusterfrick at this point as of this review i am gold iv and have been plat once and in that time i have seen more plats as a gold iv than i ever did as a plat it s goofy as hell i wouldn t buy this game to be honest the devs show no interest in fixing common and real player complaints instead erring on the side of using surveys which are vastly weighted in favor of the cn player answers most of whom all main the broken characters weps so they never receive the nerfs they need honestly man after 240 hours 80 in game 500 matches and being wr on one of the characters former temulch 50 i can honestly say i hate the state of this game devs have released a new character which is busted and basically replaces an existing one with better skills they don t seem to actually care about anything other than shelling out 20 dollar skins for weps and characters at lightning paces if you re an american with a social life or a family or full time job you will never achieve sea levels of sweatiness leaving every game to become dodge the guy with the asiatic name until final circle and then get smacked because their parry worked facing 180 degrees away from you
