2021 i am writing this negative review because of a fundamental flaw with its game design people play games for various reasons will pick what games they play to fit their interest in that regard noita is definitely worth playing if you are interested in interactive environments exploration however the rules perimeters of the game seem to be set up to punish you for doing the very thing that the game does best the game has a wonderful system for designing wands but only allows you to tinker with them in a confined room that summons a powerful enemy if you damage the room the game has interesting environments that interact with both the player enemies but if you extremely limited health will die instantly to most interactions now you might excuse these elements as difficulty that is supposed to challenge the player encourage them to improve do better on their next run but if the end result is that the player deliberately avoids taking risks or interacting with the games systems what was the point of programming them in the first place if the correct way to play the game is not fun or more correctly only fun to a limited amount of players the game is failing to live up to its own potential it also supposes that it is impossible to have multiple difficulty settings something that the game already has but only to make itself even harder if you however for some reason beyond my comprehension like difficulty in the form of randomly generated traps i would recommend noita
