2023 so this game can be fun every 1 10 games camping tunneling is prominent and that basically means that you are not going to have a good time i would never recommend this game to anyone as it is in the worst state this game has ever been in this game will disappoint you and waste your time and money the community is toxic the devs are clueless and must not play their own game they just make fodder perks and skins leaving the dumpster fire they created behind to torment the fanbase if they dont care about their game neither should you if you do get this game then prepare for dc s tunneling camping unbalanced gameplay toxicity bugs etc none of that will be fixed by the dev team because they are money hungry fiends
