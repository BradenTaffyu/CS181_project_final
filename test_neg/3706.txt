2017 the single player is pure fun it is great unfortunately that fun turns into pure disgust and frustration when i made the mistake of launching the gta online the online mode combines everything that can be wrong in an online title constant disconnects laggy peer to peer hosting cheaters modders pointless open world pvp which is enabled by default horribly unbalanced deathmach modes with no reconnect or a real team balancing every single remotely interesting online mode race is empty and everything aside the featured adversary mode is just unplaylable also no server game browser tldr the single player is great but the multiplayer part is pure cancer
