warframe is a curate s egg good in parts it is ambitious and has a lot of good and fun aspects overall though this 11 year old game is showing its age in a similar way to older mmos or especially path of exile another f2p action game an ever growing collection of overambitious neglected content islands where the developers try and include a whole other genre of game into warframe eg space shooters railjack soulslikes duviri roguelikes duviri again open world games plains of eidolon etc then they get bored of it and move on to the next new game genre i m surprised there s no battle royale mode in warframe engine limitations which mean that these new game modes have to be shoehorned into existing code in awkward ways eg the open world areas which are just very large mission instances you have to finish the open world in the correct way or you lose all your progress just like if you abort a mission an overlong leveling experience the star chart that is pretty dull repetitive and unrewarding when compared to more recent content 11 years of power creep means gameplay especially coop is all about zoom zoom gotta go fast mowing through hordes of brainless totally unchallenging enemies in order to finish the mission as fast as possible things like spy missions exist but stealth gameplay is counterproductive because it takes so long to finish a mission stealthily compared to just blasting everything much of de s monetisation is designed around regular release of new warframes playable heroes games that rely on this eventually run into problems because there end up being just too many characters and abilities to balance properly older characters end up being neglected and the developers are tempted to make each new character op cash shop prices are pretty inflated you re nickel and dimed through much of the game s interface and there are some predatory tactics eg when you go to buy a gear blueprint in the market it prominently shows you a price for the item in platinum the premium currency and hides the fact that you can buy the item s blueprint using in game currency melee weapons are stupidly powerful i basically never use my primary or secondary weapons gun because i can just throw my exploding melee boomerang glaive and obliterate everything there s also no need to use warframe abilities in most of the gameplay as enemies are so easy to defeat this means all the warframes play exactly the same zoom zoom throw glaive everything explodes warframe is a looter shooter but there is almost no actual loot instead virtually everything that drops during missions is crafting materials at a guess there are probably over 500 different crafting materials in the game the only way almost to get new gear is to craft it at a crafting station in your spaceship you have to wait real life hours or days for the crafting to complete like a mobile game or you can pay platinum to speed it up the thing which finally prompted me to write this review however is the quest called the new war this is a massive quest released in 2021 it is part of the main storyline and lots of game mechanics are gated behind it so it s really compulsory if you want to reach and keep up with warframe s endgame once you start this quest you are locked in it until you complete the whole thing which takes at least 3 4 hours you have no access to any of your warframe characters or gear instead you control various quest characters who have their own limited sets of abilities this is odd but tolerable until you reach a section where you must defeat 2 out of 3 new bosses archons these boss fights are far harder than any previous fight in the game that most players will have encountered think dark souls 3 but the bosses have an obnoxious amount of health to fight them you don t have your overpowered warframe you have a puny human armed with a bow which has to charge up before each shot and each shot removes only about 1 2 of the boss s health did i mention the bosses can heal themselves and teleport behind you so once you reach this stage of the quest your account is bricked until you defeat these overly hard and tedious too much health bosses you literally cannot play the game anymore you are locked out unless you convince digital extremes support to deactivate the quest on your account git gud i guess i ve beaten ds1 ds3 and elden ring but i can t be bothered with these boss fights they are just not what i play warframe for there are other better games for that it s fine and good to include challenging boss fights but they should be optional late game activities not a compulsory roadblock
