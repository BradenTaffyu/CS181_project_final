2020 been playing for a long time on both pc and ps4 i simply can no longer recommend this game to new players i recently invited a friend and my brother to try out the game after a couple hundred hours of playing each with me guiding them along they got to the point where they can melt lvl 120 heavy corrupted troops soon after they asked me what now to be honest i told them that was it do it again for other weapons frames they both quit soon after to be completely honest i don t blame them once you get a few tridolons under your belt complete the star chart and get some decent rivens primed mods you hit a wall the rng and mindless grindfest gets old very fast you spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours getting rivens for your weapons applying ridiculous amounts of formas and upgrading prime mods for what to kill the same lvl 30 60 monsters over and over and over again and no sortie missions are not even remotely challenging you get to the point where your weapons are so strong they don t even register the hits on low lvl monsters at times there is absolutely no end game no boss to kill no lvl 200 300 400 missions you can queue up to pvp is a joke even if you like it no1 plays it ect absolutely nothing stop trolling with the whole end game fashionframe recently they added the kuva lich system with a ridiculous amount of grind annnd a nice little sprinkle of rng on top of it it is becoming very apparent de is trying to mask the lack of end game content by adding mindless repetitive rng laced content to keep you latched empyrean was very lack luster and laced with more rng mechanics railjack and the lich system does not remotely resemble what they promised yet everyone is quick to give praise players are fed up content creators are fed up new content with lower player base the numbers don t lie
