2022 product received for free erdtree update ill buy the expansion when they unlock ultrawide that has been here since the base game launched as they just letterbox it see original review section for details on that updated review i played the base game for about 5 more hours i feel like they have fixed a lot of the networking though have not played long enough to try more secluded locations i am now playing under modded conditions with the seamless co op mod i can now direct connect to my son and now his friends whom have picked up the title just don t have invasions while i have mixed feelings on this as some jolly pvp can be fun it s kinda refreshing to just know we can sit down for 2 hours get into game and just do what we wanna do and not have to struggle with getting wiped and resummoning because of seamless coop i am able to fix ultrawide and it is glorious honestly it was coded into the base game you can tell once you play a while with it unlocked i couldn t go back to 16 9 i am leaving this review as a thumbs down untill they unlock base game ultrawide support it should not have to be modded to this extent p s as i have seen this argument before adressed in comments as well no ultra wide is not pvp breaking it s no different than using suround sound headsets to pinpoint your opponents location by sound no amount of debate will change my opinion on this original review son got me the game for someone to play with so i m playing it it s fine as a single player game however the multiplayer system is so broken about 75 of the time i get failed summons or people will get summoned into my game only to get disconnected near right away or shortly after when they do get disconnected it soft bricks my game it makes it so i can t ride torrent any more i hop on and then hop off right away like the game thinks i m still in co op and then for some reason the game won t let me quit it greys out my quit button on the menu so i hard close out the game only to log in to it nagging me about not quiting properly every time i get that stupid message i m about ready to not quit properly forever then there is no ultra wide support and because of eac i can t fix it myself unless i play offline only with how broken multiplayer is i could just do that however it defeats the purpose of trying to play with my son i have had the game load up for a good minute in 32 9 with vignetting so it is programmed in the code to work with ultra wide screens they just disabled it for some stupid reason it was glorious for the short moment it worked i dunno if this next complaint is tied into my rant about multiplayer not working or not but i personally feel the open world aspect hinders the game more than it helps it really the world is so big that the players are so spread out that i see few to no summon signs near boss fights and dungeons could be a fault of the networking when you finally do get the multiplayer to work it has that dark souls magic that is really fun but fighting most the time to scrape out some chunks of fun ain t all that fun lol also due to the massive world size multiplayer should have been handled differently this time around the sign system don t really cut it 1 stop around with summon signs it works in the more linear titles but not this signs could remain as a system for picking up randos however 2 let us just connect directly with friends and literally hook into their world and play together all players also need use of torrent as trecking this massive world on foot is a joke and ya just opt not to and play by yourselves also 3 stop kicking friends back to their own game after a boss is defeated with a project this scale and there being lesser world bosses after we beat something we should be able to continue our treck to the next open world boss or next keep castle all it s doing is adding another attempt at summoning each other that will probably fail and soft brick the game again it s just silly it all just proves to me again to stop buying games at or near release i literally have a 1 year policy where i don t touch any new games for atleast a year and elden ring was gonna be the same if my son had not bought me a copy now i m near 100 hours in my son has pretty much quit due to the fact we are rarely able to play together and i m too invested to quit so here i am frustrated at a boss room writing this review as i look at 3 summon signs on the ground that i know when i activate them they will fail sure do love this new world of games we have had the last decade or so where devs just release broken titles with intent to patch it later sand no it s not my internet every other game works like a champ we are a 4 person household with over a dozen pcs a hand full of tablets phones ps4 5s and switches you name it we got 1000 down and 200 up with 10 50 ms latency and any device that can be hardwired is hardwired also rocking new mu mimo wifi 6 mesh network basically my review needs a middle grey dash option but since steam don t have that i m giving the big red thumbs down button til the matchmaking is fixednetworking issues aside i d say it s a pretty decent title wait a year or more for patches or get a goty version with xpacs bundled in
