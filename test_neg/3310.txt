2016 gta 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me because i can t really review the whole thing as one game gta 5 s campaign and gta online are two very different things and deserve two completely different reviews i also want to note i ve also played this on ps3 pretty much since it came out and have played way too many hours on it on console first off is gta 5 s single player campaign which is in my opinion really really good there s not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as the game is just good and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas you wouldn t think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis but both of them play really well the golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf from gta 4 the driving shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell now the tumorous microtransaction riddled elephant in the room gta online simply put it s a massive grind apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won t be buying one for a pretty long time new cars are similarly overpriced the newest super car in the game costs 2 million vehicle modifications such as armor engine tune ups suspension and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do because logic i guess all of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling shark cards rockstar s overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort you can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2 99 which i believe only gets you a hundred thousand not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo to 99 99 which gives you 8 million looking back at their newest super car at 2 million that means that if you want to avoid the grind it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of real money to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game leaving you with just a little spending money even more ludicrous are the new yachts which act as big floating player homes in the ocean these start just shy of 5 million to put it plainly according to rockstar they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money this is more than the retail price of gta itself and is just aweful to sum up this half rant half praise of a review it almost seems as though gta 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game and they did just that the game that is gta 5 is still a very good game and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it the city of los santos is colorful and fun and even out in the country side there s an astonishing amount of detail however it s like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to gta online at which point rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything everything about gta online exists to make money from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat it s really a shame because once you ve played the heists which reward you with almost nothing but more cars boats planes etc to buy there s no more reason to play the game if you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp if you just like to race fast cars there s better experiences to be had it s because of gta online that i can t reccomend buying gta 5 all together especially when rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content this is all coming from someone who has been playing gta 5 since release and it s sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for
