2020 i really loved this game their ideas the gameplay and the absolute triumph of achieving the build or equipment i was looking for or finally beating that one thing i ve been meaning to beat it is a damn beautiful and cool game to boot the frames and weapons took my breath away and the things i heard about them before made me proud to be part of this communitybut all of that feels empty now not because i got tired of it but because it lost it s meaning they ve been steadily dropping the drop rate of components over time despite people nearly begging them not to do that oh the one piece you need to finish building a frame or weapon do that boss run for a couple hundred more times maybe you ll get it fine that s all forgettable but it s been 3 years or so since one of the most ground breaking quests that went into the lore of warframe they promised the new war they even went and promised us duviri paradox but still haven t delivered on these and it seems to be forgotten now there are still some game breaking bugs they haven t fixed both on pc and ps4 i m a little sick of following through the floor and now their newest update deimos freakin arcana what i certainly wasn t hoping for i want to recommend this game like i used to i had been talking to friends about playing it but now i just can t bring myself to mention it to them it s too embarrassing thinking back on the times they said it was boring and not as interesting as it used to be until they get their act up and actually do the things they promised and stop doing things like decreasing the drop rate or nerfing abilities and weapons and actually fixing some of the problems showing up in the game i can t recommend it sorry
