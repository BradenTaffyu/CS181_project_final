2022 update there s a lot less instability stuttering fps drops but they are still very much there just not as aggressively and immersion breaking which is a good thing obviously but the problem still stands 60 fps cap no ultrawide support and also the networking is horrible you wanna play co op sometimes it ll work flawlessly other times it ll never work sometimes it ll work but some guy with 10 000 ping that is desyncing kills the host and himself with the network issues and co op ends oh nyooo but you can t separate co op and pvp otherwise how will the toxic be toxic fromsoftware needs to stop making everyone so soft and stop catering to these virgin overlords either way you do like this and people are just gonna make mods to go around it so whatever it s an amazing game but i m rocking an i7 10700k oc to 4 8ghz with an rtx 3080 and i get framerate drops instability stuttering and memory leak sounds like the four horseman of terrible game launches not only that but there s a 60 fps cap and it can t even hold it up without lag cherry on top of that is no ultrawide support even though dark souls remastered came with ultrawide support we know you re able to do it hell even modders are able to do it why can t you stop using consoles as a basis for development it makes no sense edit you can use flawless widescreen just make sure you look up a guide on how to do this and disable the anti cheat and stuff otherwise you might get shadow banned to mod the game to turn ultrawide on it also comes with an fov adjustment an fps uncapper an option to turn vignette off an option to turn chromatic aberration off and an option to increase animation distance which you need on if you want to play with ultrawide otherwise npcs that are within the area that was now unlocked will have no animation and it ll look wacky the main negative to this is no online you gotta take a few steps to ensure the game doesn t launch with anti cheat and make sure you set the game in offline mode before doing all of it i mean who cares about souls pvp anyway it s for sweaty nerds sitting on their gaming chairs with their doritos giggling at the monitor as they roll a group of casuals just having a good time and they look around their basement room to see no one around alone and dark in this miserable underground the giggling slowly stops as they look away from the monitor and notice they re alone ugly and fat they consider whether it s worth living like this with no friends no value to life or to themselves they look at the bag of doritos and their awesome character build they found on youtube and spent a whole week changing their own nappies to keep up with the meta and think this is an appropriate life for them their grandma comes in with some baked cookies and they yell gosh grandma get the heck and frick out of my room i m playing fricking elden ring and he throws his filled diapers at the wall and the grandma drops the cookies and runs away crying the fat sweaty doritos covered nerd thinks to himself while he decimates at elden ring i am a true gamer and everyone should respect me as he s himself to continue being a god tier elden ring player anyway it s cringe that players who aren t even part of the official dev team figured out ultrawide and all the other fixes for pc within less than a month meanwhile the devs are like hor gorge r r marteeen waoooow yes i know management corporate is probably a giant cocksponge 100 responsible for all these fixes not being official and the developers did their best so when people refer to the devs with this sort of thing most of the hate should go to the higher ups that don t understand how it all works or maybe the actual developers should ve made it a bigger deal who the knows i m not a developer i m just a cucked consumer who paid money for a product that a bunch of randoms fixed for free either way cringe
