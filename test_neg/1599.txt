2022 real time strategy game where orders you give are simply not followed through units get half way stop for no clear reason then stand around dying while you try and out micro the ai this issue does not exist in any other total war title this is a new feature they added for twwh3 and renders the game near unplayable at the best of times it adds an element of you can t control your army to the game which is about as fun as being mugged the ai never have this problem in fact they have the opposite of this problem and can freely move without impediment even through your armies if the mood takes them in siege battles which are now a nightmare of overlapping narrow passages with zero opportunity to outflank or outmanoeuvre the enemy just shoot and smash your way through them this is a particular issue as the ai will blindly run through your armies to get to a specific area these web like mazes are a huge issue for pathing in general which is best described as rudimentary in this game on the subject of siege battles trying to make them better than attack square city made of copy paste blocks they decided to dive off the deep end and add the ability to spawn whole towers in behind your army because this is what ca consider fun and intuitive gameplay adding them before the battle makes a lot of sense a dynamic defence that you can tailor to your opponents deployment after the battle starts makes no sense how do you just build a tower behind an attacking army in seconds what the hell add to this graphics that are no better than the last two games but run far worse constant crashes and general tw rocky launches and you have possibly the worst total war game ever made twwh2 was a masterpiece twwh3 is terrible
