2023 elden ring is just worse than all 3 dark souls games the only thing it does that dark souls doesn t is the open world and while that is really nice at the beginning it gets old pretty fast but the biggest problem of elden ring are its bosses there are only like 5 unique bosses the rest gets used over and over and over in various gank setups in the increasingly caves as the game goes on and the worst part is even the unique bosses aren t that good fromsoft said they want to make the game more accessible and lower the requirements on coop and it shows it shows so badly most bosses just attack nonstop or teleport around their arenas so you either summon help or you use one of the broken builds and just trade hits with them the boss design is just so boring for the last few achievements i just used the mimic tear summon and went like 50 levels higher than i originally planned to just to finally get it over with closing thoughts elden ring is a huge disappointment most of the time you ll feel like a ds2 remake with the amount of reskin gank bosses and the few main bosses are very poorly designed the open world is nice but gets old relatively fast and very early into the game you ll just ride by everything
