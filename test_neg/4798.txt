2023 so to put it bluntly matchmaking has basically made this game just un fun to play you can read a lot of these comments about how good the gunplay is or the graphics but the only people who approve the matchmaking is those that are unaware of how bad it is casual players who aren t actively trying to get a high k d or trolls who think it s funny the get people who are mad about the matchmaking even saltier old style matchmaking prioritized connection to ensure a good uninterrupted gameplay without too much of an issue with the sbmm stupidity however if you play too well say goodbye to playable gameplay as it actively keeps pushing for people around your exact or higher skill level this can hit casual players too if they got that one 30 4 k d as they suffer for 5 10 matches of sweaty lobbies with horrid connection from having played hundred of hours in mwii 2022 a few hours in warzone and a bit in dmz i ve honestly gotta applaud activi ion for absolutely ruining the name of the old mw2 and soon to be mw3 since they re reusing the same sbmm between them you sweat every match in mwii 2022 well expect the same in mwiii 2023 2024 from my first match to my 3rd i legit spend more of my time getting spawn trapped by sweaty players than actually enjoying a single match if it wasn t for the skin for playing the beta to lv30 i wouldn t even touch mwiii 2023 2024 i would also like to add that having this all tied to warzone having 3 games in one like with the previous bundle of games i thought it was pretty clear that not everyone has the storage space for holding 3 4 games 500gb in one edit to fix this a bit you can uninstall which ones you don t play but the fact you have to install all of them at once to start still should not be an issue honestly from seeing the beta in its current state just basically being an obvious dlc to the mwii 2022 just with another 70 price tag for like what a few features that should have been in mwii 2022 ya know perks that are all available at the start of a match when you equip them a working minimap rather than a sticker to use only until you re used to the map before gluing your eyes to a compass a working suppressor when using a ghost perk and dead silence as a usable perk rather than a field upgrade i understand the devs under activi ion are trying their hardest to applease both the community and the higher ups but at this point i m seeing call of duty becoming more like a sinking ship than anything salvageable as things progress when i played this kind of game back in cod4 and mw2 i was garbage at the game and got better over time by having my ass handed to me so many times that i got a handle of how certain places work and what angles were horrid to hold there was no overpowered sbmm protection for people back then nothing to keep sweaty players from just demolishing people but they were so few and far between because there are a lot less sweaty players than casuals and because of that you were more likely to get a match where things were even because people were all there specifically to have fun how high was my average back then and did i sweat like 15kills a match but just as many if not more deaths not going hard into trying to get kills nowadays i d be lucky to get 10 without 40 deaths because i had 1 match of 20 18 sbmm isn t something protecting players it s honestly doing more harm than good casual players can t learn tactics without getting swamped hard for 10 matches after doing well in 1 sweaty players legit act as if it s ranked mode 24 7 and those of us who got good overtime from learning well none of it means jack now because if we preform well once we get thrown into a blender and dumped down the garbage disposal for a week this is not call of duty just a stupid micro transaction hell copy of it
