first of all i think the game is not bad and it should be played the reason i am writing a negative review is that i am fed up with the stupid design choices that have been continuing since dark souls 1 and no one is talking about the obvious problems of elden ring i will point out the game s flaws in my own way hoping that maybe even if it s just a small chance other players will do the same and they will make this quality game even better npc questlines the same classic silly setup that has been continuing since dark souls 1 persists in this game as well the difficulty of completing npc quests and coming across them let s admit it 90 of players complete these quests by looking at guides but even if i overlook that the progression of the quests is the same we press the interaction button repeatedly with npcs who stand like statues after doing this three times in different locations the npc quest is completed sure at the end of some quests we fight and so on but the process is the same press the talk button then press it again at the next location and continue i wonder if anyone is genuinely affected by these mostly depressive npc stories there are no cutscenes or cinematic settings they are just immobile statues this needs to be improved open world elden ring has a much larger map compared to its previous games but this beautiful and large map is filled with many repetitive bosses and identical dungeons even the creatures inside the dungeons are the same however the thing that most undermines the sense of exploration is this you re traveling in a location defeating enemies specifically placed to frustrate the player and the result you are rewarded with crappy material or an item you won t even remember the name of instead of these useless items they should include enemy armor sets weapons and items with different low drop rates this would make the sense of exploration much more satisfying and save players from meaningless and unenjoyable grinding storyline and narrative d the bosses the bosses in elden ring are really great both in terms of design environment and patterns generally they are good but it s clear that some are filled with unnecessary aoe damage and sometimes excessively high damage just to make the boss fight very difficult and frustrating for players i m not saying the bosses impossible to beat i believe the aoe combos they should be balanced and the damage they inflict should be slightly reduced the end despite its many flaws elden ring is a high quality game and i will continue playing it if we as players criticize these obvious issues we can indeed make this already high quality game even better
