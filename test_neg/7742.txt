2022 if you are planning to sail solo on your noob sloop in 2022 consider yourself a shooting target for the other players you plan to sail seas to hunt treasures and to become a pirate aaarrrr maybe try another game sessions are worst than gta online for noobies at least in gta some heroes come sometimes to the rescue but here nope i have not encountered a single pirate but trolls toxic griefers and way more advanced players than me beginning in the game you need to get the logic of the game first die respawn on your ship die because they are waiting for you to respawn die again and again and again trolls hide on your ship playing loud yt meme arrr wherrrre arrrrr the trrrrue pirrrrates the game is cool beautiful but that s it you have to play it with your friends against trained players mostly tryhards unlike gta online you cannot find another session you need to quit and restart not super fun experience
