2022 any fun i m having with this game tends to be despite the game rather than because of the game needs tune up for unit responsiveness in battles and pathing sick of units deciding that the contested ladder looks so much faster than the wide open unblocked gate and i absolutely 100 orders a unit to run around in a circle for the purposes of them just skipping the entire shift clicked route and decided that actually they were just going to count it all as completed and get completely deleted by artillery they also still haven t really fixed siege battles walls tend to be kinda barren and it just feels wrong still for a setting that is known for some extremely well defended cities it would be good if there were fallback positions or something that were consistently viable across the various walled maps ai also cheats or is given mechanical cheats like how you often aren t allowed a retreat zone from ambushes the retreat zone exists outside the map and is inaccessible so fun and engaging when skaven get to paint themselves purple as you watch and then cut your limbs off with no reinforcements so engaging great design offensive ambushes in general are bad mechanics that have zero counterplay aside from having a good enough individual army to just win every battle after you watch the completely meaningless unskippable 15 second cutscene of your leader walking which is so interesting when you have to deal with another stupid rat ambush performance is honestly terrible maxing out a 3070ti on high at 1440p not quite 60fps on the campaign map the same campaign map where zone edge borders are aliased when there s corruption like it s 2005 i don t have ridiculous standards but i do expect some quality of life from the third game i should not be ragequitting from bs every session after getting sick of clawing for every shred of satisfaction not to mention the questionable notion of campaign difficulty impacting auto resolve instead of the battle difficulty setting surely if auto resolve is meant to represent your battles the difficulty thereof should be what controls it rather than wanting diplomacy map blobbing and economy to be more challenging bug are a thing i have a campaign where the quest battle didn t spawn and can t be teleported to ai also appears to play by different movement rules so they kinda just teleport behind you for a fun and engaging game of whack a mole with march stance they also like to do nonsense double jeopardy battles where they ll assault and lose then immediately re attack and this is mechanically bs because defender units get completely wiped out when they break but attacker units do not it makes some sense because half the time defender units run out into enemy territory but that s also nonsense because there s a keep to retreat to and because the chain of nonsense isn t quite over yet this game causes frequent bluescreens about 1 every ten hours of playtime it s only this game and it happens exactly when i click an in game button and there s this weird thing where ca required the first two games for a good chunk of the immortal empires content but also still absolutely 100 insists they re worth the full aaa 60 pricetag for reasons re review all of the same hold but mods do improve it but mods can only do so much and cant do anything at all about how your units have a mind of their own and or ears full of cotton might as well build a monstrous infantry doomstack because every unit behaves like them it also disables all your mods every time the game updates so you better write down which ones you had on and for some reason fullscreen is just two or three pixels short i was hoping it d go away but no amount of debugging and troubleshooting actually made the game not have strange bugged pixels in the lower left and a few columns along the right no other game including the previous two games does this so it s just completely baffling
