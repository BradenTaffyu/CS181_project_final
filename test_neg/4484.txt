2023 the entire game is sliding and jumping to launch through the map as fast as possible because theres nothing else happening grind some lvl till you get the thing you want then wait several days till you can actually use it repeat nonstopits a boring game begging for you to spend money at literally every screen its absurd i wonder in general how many buttons in this game ask for platinum dont bother with this also make sure to laugh at all the nerds on the p2w dlcs going this is the only p2w game that deserves the money so i ll give them 20 dollars got back to it forgot again how much of this game is literally just waiting 12 hours to craft a part for a warframe after getting those 3 parts crafted now you can craft the warframe which takes 72 hours for it to craft wait a day to repeat the platformer initiation test or get the next one each mission ive done since playing i cant even tell where the enemies arre because people just slide and jump through the entire level with aoe guns one shotting everything the second it spawns just running levels like that over and over impressive how it has not changed since i last played itstill cannot skip dialogue or disable a specific one who keeps talking constantly honestly i dont know why we need 3 4 people constantly repeating the same quips or voicelines every 20 seconds in the ship its annoying also why is it however many years later since this was in beta and everything still looks like ass like humans look like they are wearing someone elses skin and everything looks like smashed together clay their mouths dont even move for half the npcs that actually talk
