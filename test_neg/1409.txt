2022 it has been anticipated for quite a long time to say expectations were high would be quite understated being part of its sizable feverish following you naturally wish for it to fulfill the idea of a game that you have made up in your imagination which in hindsight often seems foolish elden ring is fromsoftware s shot at an open world i avoid most open world games because i do not care about mindless collection and completion rodent wheels that most of them are built to be i was hoping for fromsoftware to have the wisdom to steer away from the typical trappings of what they were going to attempt and to actually deliver on what open worlds have promised to be ever since they have become the industry s favorite gimmick no need to make it explicit i don t believe they did i will not go much into the performance issues that have blighted this game so far they exist and make the game worse though my gripes lie more fundamental in nature and unlike the poor technical constitution they have no hope of being mended i am also going to assume that you are familiar with dark souls iii since this game lifts quite much from it it is more timely to simply point out where it differs open worldthe world of elden ring is segmented into several distinct zones each with a main dungeon that is relevant for making actual story progress and a variety of side content which is in significant part rather generic and repetitive there are a vast number of random soldier camps and mini dungeons that primarily exist to hold certain items of loot but do not stand out as worth seeking out for their own sake once you have seen an abundance of them the enemy rosters of the various overworld zones have a disappointing amount of overlap with soldiers and knights of various factions just being reskins of the same base model and many lesser foes being ubiquitous across a large portion of the world quite a few of the minor bosses also get reused to a silly degree at some point you may consider that stopping to fight them just doesn t seem particularly worth your investment and would rather make use of that new horse to skip right past without any trouble overall different regions are primarily distinguished by the looks of their terrain which do indeed look very pretty but in the end they largely share a lot of the same stuff and blend together as you keep playing the moment the game shines however is when you leave the uniformity of the content pastures and enter the main dungeons these are actually well crafted and intricate large structures that merit your attention and time they resemble something closer to a fromsoftware level with winding paths shortcuts and atmospheric architecture the addition of jumping has opened up new ways of traversing them and generally the pathways are more complex than ever before evoking the feeling of exploring a truly massive place gameplayif you are familiar with dark souls iii and its moment to moment combat elden ring will feel strangely familiar the basic combat loop is the same in essence with many weapons attacks and spells being completely identical to their older counterparts the most notable addition is horse combat which allows to swing weapons while moving very fast with a little bit of practice most overworld encounters can be fairly trivialized with hit and run tactics because enemies rarely get a good chance at retaliation before you dash away ground combat has a new shield counter move aswell as the ability to slot looted weapon arts onto arbitrary weapons what is odd is that elemental infusions can now be arbitrarily changed at any time now no longer is it necessary to dedicate a weapon to a particular type of damage or stat scaling it can be adjusted at any time while resting it puts to question why such a system still exists if all it does is reshuffle around some damage numbers to whatever seems suitable at the time rather than being a means to permanently invest into a weapon like some kind of roleplaying game i struggle to really come up with a succinct way of describing how i feel about bosses beyond just being generally unsatisfied with them there being such a large amount of them really underlines how dependent fromsoftware has become on creating frantic confusing difficult to read movesets as a means to create challenge for many if not most bosses i was frequently compelled into long periods of passivity unsure about when i actually had a valid opening for attacks or actions other than dodging and blocking it felt less like fighting a creature and more like playing a guessing game with frustrating stakes which technically has always been the case for dark souls to some extent but never had been this obvious before many moves are designed to force you into a timed roll by cheap means and punish simply maneuvering out of the way many melee attacks either have an aoe blast on them to force you into abusing i frames regardless of whether the weapon actually touches you or worse simply drag the boss towards you so that an attack hits even if you have pre emptively backed up not only does this make fights feel very one dimensional it also looks incredibly silly very few bosses manage to break away from being a moveset that you just have to memorize the few that do are pretty much recycled concepts from past fromsoftware games including everyone s favorite machete wielding giant storytellingcontinuing the theme of eerie familiarity is the story and lore elden ring continues the trend of having characters speak in very vague and cryptic metaphors and item descriptions being the main catalyst for worldbuilding this section may spoil the overall trajectory of the story it becomes rather obvious after a while that the story is almost beat for beat the same as dark souls iii with the names of characters and places simply being swapped out the tarnished are undead in all but name and the quest they embark on has them collect great runes instead of cinders of lords to link the restore the elden ring so that life may once again flourish in the world or maybe you want to go for the age of dark ending equivalent which i am going to predict the game will offer without having actually finished it once again it s not exactly the first time that fromsoftware has repeated itself but this time feels particularly blatant especially in context with all the other recycling that has been going on in the rest of the game final judgementi derive no joy from not recommending this game i wanted to like it as badly as anyone else it s not like it is entirely awful i have enjoyed it early on in the honeymoon phase when everything was still new and i had no idea where the game was gonna go but the creeping realization eventually set in that it really was just stretching a small amount of fresh content over a vast space and that it was not going to become any better the elden ring experiment has failed it has resulted in a shallower bloated and bland game but it looks like it s made a lot of money so there is no reason to assume that this won t be what awaits us in future fromsoftware titles this is the first one that i shelved before completing it simply due to being burnt out and ceasing to care not because of any one particular road block i have lost count of how many times i ve encountered the same dragon boss fight being repurposed by merely applying a different color and elemental damage type in once instance i even correctly predicted the reveal of an ice flavored dragon simply by the presence of a suspicious large open frozen lake there is one boss gimmick that is original to this game however i don t want to spoil it though i think it sucks
