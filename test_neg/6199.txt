2021 i try really hard to enjoy this game i genuinely want to like it because of the unique 4v1 gameplay and horror theming but every single time i finish playing the game does nothing but leave me in a terrible mood the gameplay loop is very repetitive but it works out for a few hundred hours dedicated players could easily sink thousands of hours into the game with advanced playstyles and fancy techs but that s about the only positive thing i can say about the game every other aspect of the gameplay falls completely flat the grind is absolutely horrendous to the point you re going to be wishing for gamebreaking bugs just so the devs give you free bloodpoints the game s currency as compensation it s so abysmally tedious to even just level up one single character with the perks you want to the point it took me 20 hours just to get 2 of the perks i wanted to use many gameplay mechanics are never explained and extremely unintuitive the game makes almost no effort in teaching new players how to play well and instead often encourages bad gameplay habits if you want to learn the game you will have to rely on external resources just to cover all the basics the game is insanely unintuitive for new players the learning curve is extremely steep not only do you need to learn the basics of playing as a survivor which the game s tutorial barely covers but you need to learn about every single killer their perks their add ons and their mechanics on top of trying to figure out how your own perks work with 26 different killers each having 3 perks of their own alongside a dozen add ons each you are going to be overwhelmed and confused for most of your first games and since most killers are locked behind paywalls you won t be able to play them yourself to get a better understanding unless you pay more money while there are a lot of community made resources to help learn the game faster you re going to spend more time trying to read those guides and watching those videos than actually playing the game if you go with that route combine all of this with the complete lack of a training mode the aforementioned lackluster tutorial and the only gamemode being online pvp with an mmr system that doesn t even work and you ve got a recipe for a game that is extremely unfriendly for beginners an frustrating to learn speaking of the mmr system it doesn t even work what is supposed to create balanced lobbies instead looks more like completely random pickings you could get paired up with survivors who have thousands of hours against a killer who just started or you might end up with teammates who have barely started playing going up against a killer with thousands of hours of experience the matchmaking might as well be completely random because it has no semblance of balance whatsoever and it results in most rounds being a completely one sided stomp the game s performance is also pretty terrible being extremely poorly optimized and even having performance issues such as severe fps drops and stutters for something as minimal as mouse interpolation being set to a high value the game only seems to support 500 and lower the default fps cap is also only a measly 60fps this can be raised to 120 with some file changes but most of the time you ll be struggling to reach that even with a decent pc all of this doesn t even touch on the community yet while a handful of players are laid back and just trying to have fun a lot of people in this game seem to make it their sole purpose in life to be as condescending and toxic as possible all while maintaining an inflated ego bigger than the burj khalifa if you thought lol or cs go were bad dbd is going to give you a terminal disease with it s levels of toxicity everything bad that happens is always the opponent s fault and everyone always knows better than anyone else what changes the game needs survivors are constantly whining about killers and killers are constantly whining about survivors the incessant crying over the most menial things is all you will hear in the community hubs along with perpetual trash talking of the dev studio on top of that trolls and griefers are abundant and they will find a way to screw over you and your team at any given opportunity all in all the game might look cool and fun with lots of content and i did enjoy playing it when i was queued up with friends but i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who s looking to have a fun time on their own because dbd does everything in it s might to ruin your experience at every turn unless you have 3 4 friends to consistently play with dead by daylight is not worth your money
