2021 pros fun gunfights legends with unique abilities beautiful mapscons horrible anticheat system bad servers balancing team devs easily cave in on pro streamer cries sbmm makes you carry your two teammates lots of cheaters in rank mostly diamond up note this game is pretty fun and i ll probably still play it but the reason why i can t recommend this right now is mainly cause of the bad servers apart from lag packet loss and crashes you ll most likely be dealing with missing teammates when you play solo duo update if you ve heard of arena mode and wanted to see if it s good here s my experience so far if you plan on playing solo on arena get prepared to get your balls stomped in by 3man squads cause matchmaking in this new mode is almost non existent you will get teamed up with people that will quit after you lose the first round my initial review on this game still haven t changed servers are still bad cheaters are still rampant and sbmm is still gonna give you two bots for a teammate
