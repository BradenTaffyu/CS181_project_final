2022 this is basically a negative review for people who like soulslikes and all previous souls and sekiro games if it s your first game it might be fine for you albeit very hard on the main bosses i ve played for 13 hours beaten about 2 3 major and 4 6 minor bosses and i want to say that it s honestly underwhelming firstly as usual it recycles a lot of previous enemies and bosses from dev s games however what new it adds makes very little sense and does not feel thought out at all at times as if this game was composed by ubisoft so now we have crafting what it does it do you can craft arrows and some consumables after hunting down some animals and searching for plants is hunting animals fun you ask no is looting plants fun no in previous games you simply bought all the stuff but honestly you usually didn t bother at all because consumables aren t required for progress then there s open world it s basically same as crafting as in i have no idea why they added it now there s maps there s monster camps of sorts and there s dungeons we get on this one later maps are aquired very easily and only reveal landscape even without it there s no difficulty in navigating but the problem is once again there s no real fun to be had interesting encounters are almost non existent and there s nearly no good loot to be found and even if there was you can t tell if your search will provide you something useful i must say the dungeons are obscenely bad all dungeons are structured similarly and their bosses often are very halfassed there s next to none story or interesting feel to the dungeon usually it s just some random caves or crypt with cruelly placed enemies and single obscure item in the end other than that this is basically a ubisoft game which was built over the stronger ds3 base you want more of ds 3 then you can get this you want something closer to sekiro or something more original better get nioh 2 it s way more fun honestly i m surprsied miyazaki did such a poor job on the new mechanics he decided to implement but i also have some faith that latter parts of the game will be better than what i saw so far edit after 60 hours so as i m closing to the finale of the game i have a better grasp of its problems basically the closest comparison i m willing to give it s a dark souls 2 all over again some parts are better some worse but it s basically underwhelming to the premise the core problem of the game is that it tried to go open world and adapted the worst parts of it without addressing the ingame issues which make this awkward many of those aren t seen intially but become apparent the more you play this is not true openworld er has no quests as in visible trackable quests you can do for fun no activities barely any feel of exploration worst of all the areas are very restricted at where you can go there s also no cool movement stuff like glider graphook or really anything but basic horse i d not really like to present this as an issue except for people who genuinely wanted an open world game but as er was advertised as such the intention has clearly failed worse even by trying to go open world the game plays very awkward after you progress a bit and go into areas which clearly were planned to be progressed earlier and there s a lot of those the game has astonishing amount of repeating enemies and bosses there s probably like 10 dragon fights which have same model and similar movesets there s about 6 or more golden knights it s actually easier to name a boss which wasn t reused multiple time through the game the enemies aren t very different either remember how every skyrim dungeon had draugers this is it same stuff different hp and damage everywhere before i finish i want to name some more issues which really should ve been fixed but didn t why not every boss has a respawn point by it just look at sekiro why you introduced new respawn points which are terribly hard to see in a murky pallete why not make it glowing why weight system wasn t reworked so player would not have to juggle stuff like bows and torches out of their inventory just look at nioh 1 2 why not make souls autopickup when entering boss room which also does not alloiw you simple escape anymore to save it just look at nioh 1 2 why not allow us to use runes items at the campfire shop why close the inventory after you ve used 1 why weapon damage system wasn t reworked the problem with ds weapon system is that you can t realistically know how good is the weapon later on without upgrading it and having stats for it so more often you end up with a weapon you ve started with or planned to play with you can t switch weapons most of the time because anything you find will be unupgraded this is simply bad design for an open world game with a variety of cool weapons just look at nioh 1 2 i d also like to critic the combat system but i m willing to accept that it s a dark souls 3 system and they are unwilling to change even though i believe sekiro is vastly superior but at least fix the management systems speaking of some stuff i quite enjoyed and welcome summons are kinda cool concept even though it s very stupid you can only summon them at specific points like why talisman pouches memory slots is a good concept even though they were already existing in like hollow knight weapon arts are really cool albeit fairly imbalanced also the ability to change your weapon enchant for free for your current situation at the camp site is great similarly buffing potion is good albeit pretty weak
