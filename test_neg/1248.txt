2022 elden ring is a good game perhaps the best game fromsoft has made give or take sekiro there are a lot of people who are going to play it and love it unfortunately there are also those who will read the ridiculous aggregate reviews rife with some unseasonably lofty claims and forget that this is absolutely a fromsoft game i came into elden ring as someone who has never really enjoyed fromsoft games hopeful that this would be the one that finally snags me i mean look at the reviews right despite my distaste for the sub genre i ve played and beaten each game at least once for reasons more to do with social circles than aught else so i feel like i have experienced enough of fromsoft s content to be well versed in how each game flows i was thus expecting elden ring and its open world to be the major shake up the series gameplay desperately needed in my opinion sadly this was not the case essentially in place of an engaging rich open world i found a dark souls themepark it s vast and overflowing with dark souls things you can do everywhere you look dark souls under that rock in that cave look at that castle on the hill guess what s in it that s right dark souls if you like dark souls you are going to have an absolute blast elden ring is an incredible unforgettable dark souls experience in fact for you this review should not be taken as a negative but as an overwhelming positive that said if like me you have not historically enjoyed dark souls don t expect there to be much gameplay left beyond that classic loop to make up for it elden ring is a dark souls game through and through the rooms are just wider edit horse is pretty cool tho
