2022 i paid for a game 2 years i ago that game was r6 no joke i loved the concept of the game when i bought it i couldn t play it i wasn t warned that ubi decided to limit some cpu s the ability to play to avoid fps advantages over others i bought a new ass cpu for this when i started playing i did love it then some things changed i didn t mind change is part of progress then the vanilla operators got wrecked to so that the newer ones had a better chance i was sad but i can see why it was needed maybe it the future it would have been fixed then somehow even terrorist hunt the pve mode got changed into a training one that mode now it rewards nothing first it was like playing a normal pve game but with the idea of really stopping terrorists now that game mode is dead i kept playing r6 pvp and pve alone anyways trying to get some enjoyment out of the hollow shell that is this game today as i write this review it s clear to see that buying multiplayer games is pretty much a scam you pay for a thing it gets changed and it s not small change either the pve mode is now buggy too enemies get stuck on things constantly newer operators with gadgets that are creative but often are op when first released and by making them high price with the currency you can gain by playing often than not you gotta use real money to use someone that s actually worth it in competitive play in a game you already paid for shameless i no longer support these damn scams may i play this game again because i have some friends who do so maybe but if i had a better option well ready or not is looking hella good right now so if you are reading this go check that game instead it s way better edit this keeps crashing
