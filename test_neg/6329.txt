2018 being a software engineer i can t recommend this game because their code is bad their coders must be using beginner tutorials from youtube some reasons why when i patch comes out fixing one thing something that should not be related to that at all gets broken their code is what we call spaghetti code their map objects are not sized right running to go between two tree s that you can easily fit through survivor and killer only to get stuck on them that s just being lazy if someone leaves the match 10 seconds before it starts the match will still start up now creating a very unfun unfair game lobbies constantly fail loading into game constantly fails in which you also lose your offering in the process the game allows me to be put into lobbies where the killer has a ping of 1000 killers can hit the survivor through the pallets because the code delay lag and a ton of other code related issues fix all of that and the game would be amazing but i cringe when i see the bugs that they have that have been there since launch two years ago and still haven t been fixed but let me tell you they have no problem releasing more dlc
