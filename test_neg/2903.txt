2017 gta online doesn t have any anticheat with gta online being a game where you can purchase currency for the game with real money surely they can t legally be selling shark cards right now someone can literally spend 50 on a shark card and have all that money drained by a modder in seconds with this catastrophic exploit in the game surely rockstar are not legally compliant in still selling shark cards until this is fixed so i urge them to take shark cards off of steam until this is properly patched
