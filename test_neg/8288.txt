2021 noita is the best game i cannot in good faith recommend to you right now it s an interesting and innovative take on the roguelike formula and its myriad of good points can be found in other reviews but in its current as of now 1 0 state i have difficulty recommending it the cause is a game design choice that when it happens to you is borderline unforgivable and usually instantly run ending to the point of souring the rest of the experience in noita between the main levels of the game there is a shop rest area a temple where you can buy spells and wands and is the designated place where you are allowed to edit the spells in those wands the core of the game s decision making you re encouraged to do this here because there are training dummy statues that tell you the amount of damage your spells do and anywhere outside of the temple you will be unable to re edit your wands if you ve made a mistake unless you are lucky enough to find the relevant perk that allows to to do so the problem comes in the fact that in noita almost everything is destructible if you try hard enough the brickwork of the temple is remarkably resilient compared to the average material in the game but with determined effort and ingenuity it can still be excavated by the player doing this is a huge cheese on the game as it allows you to go back to previously visited areas keep your wand editing powers have a permanent safespot etc etc so in order to counteract this there is a system in place where if too much structural damage to the temple area occurs you will have angered the gods causing an extremely powerful and dangerous lich like enemy to spawn in the shop to destroy you in retribution that means you can do it but unless you re prepared for the potentially run ending consequences you re discouraged from breaking the game too hard all good so far the problem comes in the form that certain enemies and environmental hazards can and frequently do cause damage to the temple entirely without your interaction there are giant worm enemies that can spawn at any time and burrow towards sources of food the player and through any material including the temple there are spider like enemies in the jungle level that have the ability to burrow downwards to chase you acid burns through nearly any material and a sub type of enemy that can appear as soon as level 1 bleeds acid when you shoot it any of the following reasons or more can damage the temple beyond the point the gods are willing to tolerate often without your even having seen it causing said enemy to appear and more often than not kill you before you have a chance to form a contingency plan fun not fun the devs gave a token effort to remedy this problem in the form of crystal that repels digging worms in a small area around the shop but it is woefully inadequate at its only designated function worms frequently dig through the rightmost area of the shop farthest from the crystal despite it and the spider enemies and acid are entirely unaffected by it the lead dev has expressed in interviews that he thinks this random interaction can be a source of fun for a run and experienced players will hand wave this glaring issue with the game as acceptable because the strong enemy can technically be killed and even cheesed if you are experienced but with the overall length of time it takes to get a run going compared to the relative frequency of these occurrences i can t classify it as anything other than an egregious oversight in an otherwise refreshing and compelling roguelike in my experience with the game so far you will have a worm thoroughly ignore the anti worm crystal roughly 1 in 20 runs and if you get a run deeper down into the game to the jungle where the spiders hang out they will ruin your day while tinkering with your wands roughly 1 in 5 runs for a game where a good run can take 1 2 hours just to get started this is a huge blow to enjoyability edit from more play experience the other hidden danger is literally hidden information most good roguelikes do a pretty good job making sure any mechanics are well explained and information is not unduly hidden from you so that you feel like any deaths are strictly your fault and not the game s noita does a reasonable job providing useful information about its spells and mechanics but frequently hides critical hidden information from you about its spells and perks that can end up hobbling or outright ending a run this shouldn t be confused with me complaining about secrets which also frequently kill you or the usual roguelike self inflicted yasd or an unknown enemy one shotting you that s normal roguelike behavior for instance there is a perk that tells you it reduces spell spread at the cost of increasing spell recoil no problem there however if you pick it you may suddenly notice that your spells also take longer to cast a downside entirely unadvertised in my case it turned a tuned primary wand from my best combo weapon to non functioning all because i picked up a perk with hidden drawbacks wands can have similar hidden passives based on what spells they have slotted electricity spell wands will instant kill you if you enter water for more than a few seconds fire spells can set you ablaze from the flaming tip of your wand noxious gas can come from wands with toxic spells equipped none of these are advertised effects you will eventually die to one of them you didn t know about before or worse forget about one you ve already died to and it won t be your fault in addition for wands that have an auto cast spell you cannot hover over the tooltip of the spell to find out what it is unlike a normal slotted spell don t know what spell that symbol is too bad hopefully it doesn t get you instantly killed finding out my recommendation is that if you commit to this game you should break the unspoken rule of roguelikes and look up as much information about spells and wands as you can from outside of the game the spell lab mod is particularly great at this as it has a challenge mode that explains hidden spell mechanic interactions that can help you get the most out of what does exist in the game
