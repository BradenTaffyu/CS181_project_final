2022 i really want to like this game but i can t it can probably be a good game for players who like pvp if in the right company but it s not a game for solo pve players like me like i wrote in my old review i wish there were dedicated pve servers or the possibility to play in offline mode i mean the content is there they don t need to add pve content they just need to make the game have seperate servers for pve and pvp some pve players most i think just want to do thier pve stuff without getting killed by other players all the time especially since there s people who will spawn camp you for hours 4 against 1 then for pvp players what fun is there to bully someone who just fish and don t even try to fight back if you want pvp action you surely would enjoy playing against others who want the same so in conclusion i think everyone would benefit from having seperate pve and pvp servers or at least an option to turn on pve mode which let you play on pve server even tho pvp remain default old review 5 7 h there really should be dedicated pve servers some of us just want to enjoy the pve aspect without getting killed over and over by pvpers also the game feels sooooo slow and unrewarding sadly edit so i gave it another try and it seems that the player base is quite toxic as well not everyone but most people on pc at least from my experience most people attack everyone on sight regardless if you re just fishing or talking to an npc even a full crew on the biggest ship attacks a solo player on the smallest ship and spawn camp them this game can maybe be good for playing with friends if you enjoy pvp but sadly not respectful towards casual pve ers
