2016 product received for free alright boys and girls super salty rant time this game is not worth the money if you want it for online only i repeat if you are only interested in online do not purchase this game there have been a lot of false bans being issued recently and r does not care if you were falsely banned i have been banned for 4 days now and i have written 4 tickets to support three of which have recieved the same response two were from a bot the third was a real person but still the same response i don t have a clue why i was banned because ive never modded never exploited and never even recieved money from any other players the only thing ive done in the game is cuss some guy out because he called me a f aggot after i said he was salty supposedly you can be banned for being overly racist homophobic or disrespectful towards a religion i cussed someone out for using homophobic slurs i defended homosexuals while he bashed them so if that warrants a ban me right ive done everything i could to contact r support including the 4 support tickets as mentioned above a forum post tweets and dm s to both their support and games accounts and ive even called the support line over 100 times only to never talk to a human all ive asked for in my tickets dms posts whatever is a reason for being banned or a removal of the ban yet im still no closer to understanding why i was banned if and only if i hear back from support before my ban is automatically lifted i will alter this review to reflect upon it but as of right now i cannot recommend this game for anyone only interested in the online feature as of this particular point in time i wont be playing online until i get a response from r support telling me why i was banned in the first place because ive read many a post about people being banned not knowing why then getting banned again after attempting to play online again go ahead and say what you want im sure i ll get lots of you cheated you got caught deal with it comments but i know that i havent broken any rules and i could honestly care less what people assume of me edit they never got back to me but i would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like teamspeak discord and skype as well as possibly steams fps counter or recording software like bandicam and fraps
