2018 instead of just adding a filter that blocks out racial slurs you ban people for it this is not how you fix a problem like this have to give it a thumbs down because of it no i do not agree with abusive racial chat messages but if you are gona ban people because of it then you might aswell ban people for doing the same in voice chat if you got the balls to auto ban people from chat then don t worry cause full censorship is already well on it s way
