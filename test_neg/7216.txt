dragon s dogma 2 looks better and is bigger than the first everything else is either on par or worse than dragon s dogma a lot of stuff could be fixed with dlc but right now i don t think it s worth the price you are better off waiting for a future sale preferably one that would include said dlc enemy variety is a problem none of the bitterblack isle enemies make a return and even some enemies from the original base game are missing there are a couple of new additions unique to this game but aside from the minotaurs all of them are either one off encounters and or can only be found in a single location so for most of the game you will be fighting the same goblins bandits ogres cyclopes and such over and over and you fight a lot in this game despite the game being so much bigger than the first enemy density is really high when exploring the world it can get to the point especially in the game s second region that encounters start to stack on top of each other because of how close they are as a result of this it s easy to get tired of the small selection of enemies very quickly exploration is a bit of a mixed bag on one hand dragon s dogma 2 gives you the freedom to go wherever you want whenever you want even if a location seems blocked off to you for story reasons there s likely an alternate route you can take this is useful considering that two of the game s vocations are located almost right next to where the end of the game takes place but aside from cases like that and a few hidden encounters across the map i didn t find exploring to be all that rewarding a lot of the caves in the game don t have any side quests tied to them don t have a boss or unique encounter in them and don t have any interesting loot at one point the last piece of gear i found in one of them was a cheap chest piece i had already bought at the city in the same region there are some unique gear pieces you will only find out in the world but they re rare enough you can easily miss them speaking of gear the equipment system is much simpler compared to dragon s dogma the gloves are now tied to your chest piece and the clothing layer for the chest and leg slots no longer exist instead being tied to chest and leg armor respectively there isn t any armor with unique effects so most of the time you will just be using whatever has the highest stats unless you are stubborn like me and choose to forsake efficiency in the name of fashion what vocations can wear what armor doesn t always make sense either there are cases where pieces of armor look like they should be part of the same set can t be worn together because separately they require different vocations all this combined will likely result in many arisen and their pawns looking the same as other players i m personally not a fan of how vocations were handled compared to the dragon s dogma despite every vocation gaining an extra active skill slot and some old ones being made into passive core abilities some vocations ended up being more limited than before a good example is mage in dragon s dogma mage had to slot in their main healing spell but they also had 2 sets of 3 skills for a total of 6 in dragon s dogma 2 mage s main heal is now tied to their heavy attack but they only have 4 slots total meaning they lose out on 1 or 2 since you didn t need to keep your heal in dragon s dogma fighter is similar since sword mace and shield skills now share the same slots instead of being separate mystic knight and sword based assassin despite getting replacements or being folded into other vocations are sorely missed in terms of play style vocations are all limited to a specific weapon type so no more sword dagger and bow builds which i really felt with how many times i wish i could just pull out a bow on my thief to hit a flyer the new warfarer vocation who can use all armor and any weapon is flawed in that weapon skills don t swap between weapons and swapping your weapon takes up one of your skill slots so if you were hoping to recreate one of the old hybrids you might be disappointed the game is also too easy and lacks a hard mode there is no everfall or bitterblack isle from dragon s dogma equivalent to be found here the post game ends up being more of an annoyance rather than a challenge enemies don t even scale up when you enter ng despite ng offering additional ways to increase your character s power you will eventually get to the point where nothing can threaten you even without maxing our your gear and levels the story sucks there s no sugarcoating it most of the main story has you doing fetch quests and running around to talk to different people most of which don t involve any combat hell literally half of them don t require you to leave the game s first major city and come from the same guy once you get past this boring political intrigue plot the story tries to speedrun you through the game s second region so fast that it s possible to accidentally find yourself at the end of the game before you even realize it s also really odd how the game spends so much time having you learning what s going on in the first city only to completely gloss over the second one as a minor spoiler the leader of this area is featured on the game s cover art and you never interact with them outside of a few very brief sidequests but even if it we did interact with them more i likely wouldn t have cared anyway there s a very small handful of interesting characters in the game and even those are still limited in how relevant they are i think i would have liked this game more had i not played dragon s dogma specifically dragon s dogma dark arisen it feels like no lessons were learned from the original game i see people talk about a potential dragon s dogma 2 dark arisen being able to fix these issues but this is stuff that should have been part of or considered for the base game i don t want to end up paying more money for this game to get up to the point where dragon s dogma dark arisen currently is that s why i can t rightfully recommend this game in it s current state at it s current full price
