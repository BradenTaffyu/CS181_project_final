2022 all of these hours are from the good ol days up to the eidolon update in my opinion problems with warframe were really starting when archwings came out and hearing about the various changes over the years just solidifies that view back when it first came out there was an achievable progression and that space ninja vibe was really in place some of the best times in my life but that will not cloud what i perceive to be an error in philosophy the best parts of warframe are the frames the abilities builds and the modems that go with augmenting them the most amount of polish in the game is concentrated there no doubt it is the best part of the game and it kept my interest for 800 hours when you spend so much dev time on very middling and mixed expansions such as eidolon or archwings such the dissonance there really detracts from the experience i respect the fact that game development itself is fun and trying new things is fine but when you implement things that in themselves don t truly flesh out the game and do this multiple times there comes a point where the identity of the game is in question eidolons were very clearly implemented when open worlds were hot and the archwings were whatever they were trying to be i feel like the cohesion of your game should matter a bit more than whatever you feel like cobbling together lastly the grinding perhaps with regard to newer players the number one reason i can t recommend warframe there is that difficult territory when you are trying to accomplish making content that keep older players interested as well as drawing new players and one solution to this is padding of whatever the new content is this favors the older players and makes it more difficult for newer players sure the new players will be wowed by the initial warframe and its moderate beginnings however when an mmo adds so much grinding and adds so many systems to navigate optimize this game is no longer new player friendly it is adding new things not refining the old and hoping that the young are entranced enough to deal with the curve that warframe now has now maybe for someone who is a glutton for the whetstone this may be fine it may be a worthy investment of time for me though it no longer is and i feel the same can be said for many others tl dr for anyone new i won t denounce giving warframe a shot enjoy the experience while you can extract that warframe feel the game is free but i will not recommend staying the grind at this point is and what else value you get out of it is perceived at best
