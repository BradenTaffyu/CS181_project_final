2022 after patch 1 02 1this patch claims to address some performance issues first of all on my rig the loading times became noticeably slower before travelling to sites of lost grace was almost instant now it s very much not i checked with my friend who played before and after he also noticed the same furthermore now i see stutter in some indoor ares whereas before i had it mostly in the open world areas outdoor areas are not working any better for me too basically i have worse experience than before the patch original reviewok the core of the game is brilliant sadly i can t recommend it now as of patch 1 02 i disregarded all the technical reviews where a lot of people complained about performance most of them didn t run the game on the highest end hardware so i thought hey my specs are better certainly my hardware will manage no this is definitely not subjective not specific to only my software hardware as you can see all over the internet people with 20 series and 30 series are having the same problems as i am i have strix rtx 3090 oc i5 12600k 32 gigs of ddr5 and wd black sn850 i also have the latest video card drivers the ones that explicitly mention elden ring support the latest windows 10 updates the game manages to drop frames as low as 40 on pretty much any settings i also have vrr monitor and it helps but not much i can perceive frame drops without any fps counters as it reflects on the gameplay it s especially noticeable in the open world areas and affects not only the visual fluidity but also the flow of the battle for me basically not only the frame rate drops make it harder to time a dodging roll just because the game suddenly stutters right during a boss attack it also directly translate to input lag where pressing a button does not immediately result in a corresponding action this game requires precision and the stutter cripples that in dungeons literal dungeons or areas behind the fog it runs pretty well for instance i had no problems during the margit fight and enjoyed it a lot but fighting tree sentinel was so choppy i just had to quit the game for good edit after playing more godrick the grafted which is not open world and is not optional fight was pretty awful performance wise most of the time it was smooth but at random times when i was very close to the boss and he would do some attack the game would stutter only because of that it took me almost twice as long to defeat him now on the same hardware i can run dying light 2 with all the ray tracing effects on at 4k with dlss with locked 60 fps well it drops very very rarely and i can see it only from the counter it doesn t affect the actual gameplay if i disable rt in that game it runs so well my pc is dead silent doesn t stress anything enough to engage fans to make them audible enough this is mind blowing i mean elden ring looks great but it doesn t have any of the interesting technical effects i wouldn t call this game next gen in any sense it doesn t have photorealistic textures of horizon forbidden west it doesn t have incredible shadows and illumination of dying light 2 sadly i can t refund this anymore more than 2 hours played most of that time i spent trying out different video configurations and going to different areas of the game finally i went on and bought the game on xbox series x in performance mode it looks good never scales up to 2160p in open world so it s not as clear on 4k display as the pc version and runs perceptibly better it does have fps fluctuation but it doesn t effect the gameplay as much as it does on pc furthermore xsx runs the game dead silent while my pc is very audible in open world areas as the game makes the gpu card clock speed go to the maximum frequencies are higher here when in dying light 2 with all the rt please don t support this sort of attitude from the developer with your money i regret that i did this is the only new game that runs worse on my pc than on the current generation of consoles it s beyond ridiculous if you have the chance go for the console version if you don t just wait for some patches some additional information for more clarity geforce driver 511 79 has game ready for elden ring in the release notes things i ve tried in the game settings changing pretty much every setting from lowest to max 2160p resolution 1440p resolution pretty much the same issues i mean on rtx 3090 what the bloody hellnow it s a d2d12 game so it has direct access to low level apis which means i had little hope in any of the suggestions found online would help but it didn t take me too long to try so i did the high performance thing in graphics settings of windows unlimited shader cache size in nvidia settings disabling microsoft device association root enumerator none of the above resulted in a smooth experience basically whatever is causing the stutter would cause the stutter no matter what settings i had i can run at 1080 with lowest settings and get stutters at exactly the same places as with 2160p and maximum settings the game is not bottlenecked by any of my hardware it s something wrong about the way the developers used d3d12 it seems out of curiosity i ve underpowered my gpu from power target 100 to 80 lowered gpu boost clock from 1860 mhz to 1674 mhz listen to this no effect on the performance whatsoever i mean elden ring was actually utilizing the gpu to the max and stuttering now it works absolutely the same with significantly underpowered gpu now as for comparison to xsx version as i ve played it a bit more now initial loading time continue from main menu is twice as slow on xbox series x as on my pc this is a bummer looks like loading time on death are slightly better than the initial loading but it s still much slower than that of pc in open world the resolution is very noticeably lower than 2160p furtermore the frame rates are very eager to drop my current go to for testing is the very early tree sentinel fight on pc it s jarringly bad on xsx in addition to having sub 4k resolution the frame rate here goes pretty low but it doesn t feel that bad with vrr i actually almost killed the boss with the initial level character on my first attempt on xsx on pc i struggled to kill him even after gaining levels and downing margit only because of the major stutter in conclusion please don t give money to this kind of developer i see already that the game sold very well on pc and it s sad i mean who forced the company to release the pc version without properly testing it i am awfully sure they were aware of the performance issues when they released it otherwise they had zero testing which is even worse why not release the console versions first and delay the pc version also i scanned the steam forums reviews and there are still plenty of people claiming they have a smooth experience at this point i don t believe they do by now i know some people tend not to pay attention i ve seen plenty of people before current gen consoles claiming they are totally happy with 30 fps in their games and saying that 60 does not improve the game now look since the ps5 and xsx started having plenty of games supporting higher frame rates the console crowd is loving it and complainign about new games running at 30 fps now people are saying that anything higher than 60 is unnecessary and not even perceivable yeah right in a couple of generation the consoles will have 120 fps in plenty of games and people will enjoy that
