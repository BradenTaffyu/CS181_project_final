2022 fubisoftsiege was fantastic and fun in its first 2 years despite an exclusive focus on multiplayer which then alienated existing fans of the r6 franchise then ubisoft let the smell of money go to their heads and gradually drove it to the ground in both gameplay and tone they took an existing franchise and rode its name to create a mainstream crowdpleaser with fortnite tier cosmetics and events which make a mockery of rainbow six r6 siege didn t start as a game for r6 fans but it could pass off as a worthy mp focused spinoff of the franchise it doesn t even hold that title anymore this is now a game made for clickbait streamers whales who would suffer through the ridiculous monetization and sweaty overly competitive kids who must maintain their kpd and verbally violate everyone s mother at least once per match in order to live through the day to further hammer home that ubisoft don t know and don t care what rainbow six fans want the next upcoming r6 game is confirmed to be based off an event siege had with aliens they could name it ayylmao s final retreat and it would get the same attention or lack of attention for that matter you did not need to use the r6 name for that crap but of course they did bother renaming it from r6 quarantine to r6 extraction because avoiding a silly misunderstanding and sensitive journalists stirring the pot with the game s name is something they do care about this is unworthy of the tom clancy and rainbow six names ubisoft is not worthy of these names nor ghost recon or splinter cell the moment tom clancy passed away ubisoft has opened the floodgates of cringe and just went to town on the licenses they own where the conversation isn t what would be the next logical step for this franchise but rather okay how do we apply our moneymaking cookie cutter template on these franchises reputation be damned
