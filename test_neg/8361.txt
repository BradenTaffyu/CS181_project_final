2022 1 even if you play like a god you only achieve the bare minimum and are still at the mercy of rng so it s just not worth it going out of your way to play well when rng is going to make or break a run 2 one of the selling points wand crafting is barely present most of the time i ve literally never been able to craft an interesting wand because the opportunity simply was never there powerful combos are more interesting than powerful spells but the latter s all i ever found 3 spells are not that varied after a while it got really repetitive a lot of them are useless which is only exacerbated by how limited the inventory and the wand crafting mechanic is 4 criminally underutilizes it s own tech simulating every pixel is largely inconsequential for the type of game this is and during gameplay itself really makes me wonder if a roguelike was the best choice 5 i understand there are material interactions involving liquids and powders but this is also something nearly impossible to use it also feels either underdeveloped or underutilized not to mention using potions is a big hassle for no reason which barely pays off i m surprised that i d find a game that just rewards the player less and less the more they play i d argue this game is actually easier than something like cuphead but playing it is just not rewarding enough for me it asks for way too much patience for something that is trying to entertain and if my 58 hours isn t enough to get to see some then i d just have to move because this game isn t worth the effort anymore edit lmao at the manchild defense force apparently bombing a freaking review
