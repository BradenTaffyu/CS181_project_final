2017 don t play this game with your wife gf etc it s toxic for relationships this is a tough one i love this game but i also hate it the game can be so much fun yet it can also get so frustrating progression in ranks resets every month so you get new players and prestiged ones all in the same pool for matchmaking it is so imbalanced that it can put people with 10 hours and 2000 hours in the same game then there are people that de rank themselves on purpose so that they can play with easy inexperienced players to feed their egos the victory cube update totally screwed the game up yet the devs won t admit it before the update ranking up was easier for killers they just had to make points and it didn t matter how they made them they would take more chances play smarter risk a hook for the thrill of a chase and overall it was just more fun for both sides killers are just camping hooks now even after setting traps and hexes or they just stay in blink chainsaw hatchet distance with insidious perk can t blame them completely since the update kind of forces them to secure kills in order to progress in ranks but it has totally taken the fun out of the game killers can see survivors profiles and characters they can equip perks and addons depending on what the survivors are bringing to the match flashlights immune to burn toolboxes hex ruin etc they can decide to dodge lobbies when they come up against experienced survivors however survivors can t see sh t what is even worse is the killers host the game and they don t even have a ping indicator in the game you go in blind and start running into walls and trees if you disconnect you are kind of betraying your teammates gifting the killer a secure kill and losing 3 pips from your progression there are 3rd party addons to show latency mlga but they really need to build one into the game also the feature to block face camping killers so you don t have to play with them again it s not an aaatitle it s not really expensive but it has 27000 people playing right now it s probably too much to handle for a small studio so things take a while to get fixed it has so much potential and it s different than other survival games of it s kind but i wouldn t recommend the game in it s current state
