2023 boy oh boy i m gonna get some smelly pirates angry at me but please read first this game is amazing so immersive so beautiful literally feels like the world is alive but i m not really a pvp person if i can i will avoid it but i love doing the main quests related to the story and fight skeletons and bosses pillage vaults and active forts there s so much content i love that doesn t relate people more often than not i just want to farm my fishing rank by selling it to the emissary in the sea post and some degenerates in a huge boat will gank me and kill me for 8 bananas in my possession and then if i display my displeasure towards such unnecessary retaliation i get insulted and told it s called sea of thieves not sea of cucks okay man do you even hug your mother do you need some sort of support you spend your money constantly on boat skins and seasons passes but can t even afford therapy bro let me fish in peace i don t want your smoke sometimes i m just focusing on the tales and literally have only 8 bananas in my possession you bet your runt i will sail into the red sea and make you waste your precious time if you follow me i would love if this game had a single player option or an option in which i could host to play with my friends some people just wanna focus on the lore and fight mobs and npc s you re not any better than me if you play this game 24 7 and constantly pick reaper to torment people that aren t even engaging in battle with you let me do my thing and enjoy the same game i bought with my money the way i see fit just like you that argument that it s called sea of thieves and blah blah blah is dog water it just shows you use little to no brain and think only your way of thinking is the right one if you really have this mentality you re boring anyway that s all if they do add a sp feature in the future i will change my review cheers edit hey people thank you for the awards and kind words via dm s also the clown award givers i m glad you decide to give me points even though you disagree with me 3 i got so many 10k profiles if i m a clown at least i ll be a clown with a fancy profile edit 19 10 2023 i want to thank everyone who agreed with me and were loud along with my complaint we did it we can now play with our friends without dealing with toxic degens thank you for making this possible
