2022 edited 09 08 2023im adding on to my previous review in light of the dlc price reveal for shadows of change 25 euroes is a joke thats almost half of baldurs gate 3 for less content than some older dlc i dont know if its sega forcing the price or ca being arrogant but this kind of customer milking while not even fixing existing bugs regularly makes me sad more than anything else whats supposed to be a capstone of the trilogy is just being constantly mistreated as a money cow with the attitude of they re going to lap it up anyway needless to say i wont be buying the dlc review edit end complacency if there was one word to describe this game its complacency warhammer 3 isnt a bad game not enough to usually warrant a negative review but in the context of its messy launch lackluster or poorly thought out content the entire selling model of the franchise and knowledge that the main team has been pulled off the project entirely definitely makes it clear the higher ups just expected it to sell with no respect for the consumer
