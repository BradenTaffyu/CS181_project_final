2015 below is my previous review that was written right after launch my view on the game has since changed my reccomendation has since changed i do recommend the game my biggest gripe at this point is the fact that the entire rainbow six franchise is based off a novel and this game has no story to speak of we miss you tom clancy it s fun and everything very fun but it s amazing how little content there actually is for the 60 dollar price tag in 2015 compared to it s predecessorsi can t recommend it at full price though i d recommend waiting for a price drop or getting it on sale though editi will delete any comment regarding a particular key reseller congratualations on missing the point
