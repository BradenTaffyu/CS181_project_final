2021 first up this is just my second account on steam on my main account i m level 172 plat 2 with almost 900 hours on pc and played since release on xbox till plat 1 almost diamond feel free to share this review with your friends and or buddy s to finally get ubisoft to understand that rainbow six siege is just a show that needs to be reworked and rethought to stay relevant rainbow six siege is a game that i loved playing almost religiously every single day with my friends nowadays i see myself tired of this game almost playing next to none playing games like halo half life csgo homeworld remastered hearts of iron 4 day of defeat source left 4 dead battlefield 4 and 1 again and having the fun of my life inside those games that s a moment i thought to myself how come i have this fun again this mysterious feeling of i up but i m still laughing about it this was the time it clicked inside my head you see all the games listed above encourage you to play casually and to have fun the games don t take themselves seriously yeah yeah csgo has a massive pro league behind it but we still play it casually or like your friend saying yo man if you one click this awp in mid with a deagle i ll spent ya a beer and you of course you go ahead and do it even if you die you all can laugh about it or you can just mess around in tdm conquest battlefield co op and i don t know what else rainbow six siege doesn t encourage casual play which it needs it even punishes you for it that is sad but also true think about quickmatch remember when it was called casual yeah we all miss those times right you can t play siege for fun or casually as the game doesn t allow it siege would need to make the in game events playable for any given time like sugar fright doctors curse and yes i know you can host event game modes in the near future but you would still need 9 other players for it and invite them also rainbow six siege could also add team death match where players just play for points respawning and killing the opfor opposing force for all of you who don t know what opfor stands for of course they would need to make maps for this specific game mode but wouldn t that be better then to search for an quickmatch where you die the moment you spawn because of spawnpeeks or an operator that your team didn t call out because there is no real communication going on and then wait 3 whole minutes to play again because this one teammate decides to stay on the roof on bank to save his k d quickmatch is also infuriating for many players as they play most of the time solo or with a buddy and then have to sweat for nothing just because the 9th million jaeger or ash main destroys you and treats it as ranked and even talks you in the chat it becomes tiresome and frustrating but hey atleast the devs put much effort into making events and event maps that we can only play for a limited time instead of adding fresh new game modes to a game that would really need it now as we are on the adding things the game is stale there is no need to lie as even a hardcore fan must admit that it is really boring as of right now flores didn t add much to the game and is almost forgotten as a maverick or zofia ash does the job much better than him in my opinion which can differ greatly to everyone to any region because they aren t handicaped because of mute and or mozzi which you see often in the game with the new season north star or however it is called the new healing operator thunderbird is also underwhelming as people tend to use doc because of the mp 5 giving her the ability for the spear 308 won t change to much about it even if it is an assault rifle that she gets doesn t mean that she will be strong and even will be nerfed before she even comes out like they did with flores the same applies to the jager nerf who in their right mind though it s a good idea to nerf his gun if you think about it the devs wanted to make roaming with him harder as he can t be as strong in firefights anymore as before but its his ability that makes him great and the gun as people love playing with it looks cool works smooth and is satisfying and removing 5 bullets and an increase of vertical recoil won t affect him to much as he is still a viable operator with a satisfying gun and the best gadget in the whole game we must wait now for almost a year for the nokk buff and melusi nerf nokk is not picked often and would be greatly improved with it while melusi is not only overpicked but is also a really strong operator and great intel giver as her banshees have these wobble sound effects when you come near them but oh yeah right melusi got nerfed by removing the t 5 and replacing it with the mp5 sake ubisoft whatever you smoked stop it or at least give me some of it too ban phases oh boy oh man how about you guys just delete this system and just implement one like csgo has where can you choose the maps you want to play on instead of having 3 different random maps chosen for you where you ban with the opposing team but you still end up banning bank together and now it chooses between theme park and oregon great thing right i mean yeah this whole map ban system is complete worthless as it still is random which map you play on in theory it works but practically it doesn t i guess i can give the at least you tried award to you guys for this one feature toxicity is something you guys are working actively against but still it shows no real impact even with your new system that will come with the trust factor won t be doing too much against it look at overwatch the whole community there is toxic as hell and yes i played overwatch back in 2016 as some friends forced me to it this is something that every heavy competitive game must go through as players become actively frustrated because of their teammates and the enemy being hardstuck gold i for the entire season and don t even rank up as they clearly show a higher skill level unlike their team and still play against diamond players but eh guess this is how things are now ubisoft you must do much more to the game then you imagine the way you handle it as a very serious tactical competitive shooter doesn t work don t forget the casual players and no don t tell me you didn t forget about them and that you try everything possible to make everyone happy as this is not the case don t listen to much what plat 1 champion players say and what the pro league says it s the same with zofias withstand mechanic for all the years it worked perfectly fine after this one match in pro league it got removed as it didn t fit into rainbow six siege and not because of this stream i call as it was a great mechanic and i never felt that it is unfair as only zofia could do it with only 5 hp and most of the time you still died but it defined her character in my opinion you guys miss the mark in what rainbow six siege wants to be you treat it as a very serious tactical shooter but the more serious it gets the more frustrated players will be they stop playing the game because they burn out and can t have fun in it and eventually leave new players can t get a foot in the door as they either get demolished by smurfs or good players and maybe play the game 5 hours and eventually leave when they meet with a very sweaty and toxic community the game is stale for long term players as you don t make new maps we can play on and create new tactics if you can call them tactics anymore no real interesting operator no new weapons that spice things up again i think there is even more to add to this review but it already is too long and i thank you all who have read this far i think that everyone who comes across this review should also add their own opinion to the current state of the game which i enc
