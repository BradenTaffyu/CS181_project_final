2022 this was written before champions of chaos was announced i will not be changing the rating delivering unfinished products and updating them later is not a practice that should be rewarded i m new to total war i began with warhammer ii back in 2019 inspired to purchase by mandalore s video i enjoy 2 far more than 3 tl dr don t buy this even on a sale wait for it to be complete because it isn t done yet let s start with the game itself the campaign is ass granted it s much better than it was on launch but you d think ca would have taken criticism of the vortex campaign in 2 and made something more bearable but it isn t as a matter of fact it s worse than the vortex you are hard pushed to play the campaign whereas vortex allowed more freedom one of the reasons that roc sucks so much is these rifts that start spawning after 30 turns and spew chaos corruption which tanks the control of your settlements and one of four effects depending on the flavor of monster energy you have to deal with these rifts will also pop out enemy agents and sometimes armies that will always prioritize you as the game goes on and more souls are collected these armies will become stronger and stronger until you have to start babysitting your settlements lest they are torn from your control and you start hemorrhaging even more money and you have to do this for every province group of settlements thus the game almost forces you into two or three if you re lucky provinces so you can manage whatever the rifts decide to puke at you all while handling anywhere between 2 to 5 different enemies and their 3 deathstack armies on your own that s yet another issue potential a new background mechanic that was introduced in warhammer 3was faction potential which from what i m aware of dictates how much a given ai faction will cheat and they will cheat the thing is minor factions have significantly less potential than factions directly competing against you in roc this indirectly affects diplomacy specifically military alliances when you ally either defensive or military that faction s ai is heavily gimped their potential hits rock bottom and they will be hard pressed to protect their province capitals with 20 stacks and if that faction just so happens to be of your race say cathay or kislev good luck confederating because for some godforsaken reason the ai considers your military power in addition to theirs when you offer confederation now some of these issues may have been already addressed but i don t care as of original writing i have not touched this game since april two months after its release which fun fact is about how long it took for a patch to come out that even slightly addressed these issues ca s radio silence for the first three months of warhammer 3 s release is despicable warhammer 2 received many more substantial updates including the highly anticipated map painting mode in one month we are expected to receive a beta for immortal empires in september what s even more frustrating is a relatively small issue that being slow replenishment for tzeentch and slaanesh being on a roadmap that should have been fixed a week after release
