2016 lets start with the pro s of r6 s unique gameplay with a plethora of descructible surfaces unique operators with unique gadgets constantly shifting meta more or less decent variety of weaponry and operator nationalities proper level design besides for two spawn kill spots which are easy fixes and a growing playerbase now to the cons which i believe greatly outweigh the pro s no i m not making my claims out of rage and salt i ve gathered roughly 700 hours between both of my uplay accounts on this game i ve come to notice and condemn each and every problem to my knowledge 1 valk glitch with her camera still not patched seriously ubisoft 2 the absolutely horrific hitregistration don t discredit your community ubisoft 99 of us aren t idiots we know the clear difference between headshots and neckshots evidently you don t know basic human enatomy expanding on hitreg it s terrible it was initially terrible from release they started fixing it but it just took another plummit after skull rain whether it be body shots head shots shields through walls ect the hit registration fails a large portion of the time if you don t get consecutive headshots you may not be one to notice it but for those of us that do i m sure it s a huge problem for you us the fact that a ranked match can be decided by my headshot not registering is aboslutely cancerous and has infact happened 3 the massively large amounts of connectivity issues throughout the community i know not everyone will have the greatest internet connectivity and so on and i can say they have slightly improved their connectivity issues however it s still abissmal you can still get stupidly long wait times you can still randomly be removed from a match for xxx error not only that joining parties with people is a huge hassle especially if its a friend over in the uk or elsewhere i m glad they re taking steps to improve their connectivity but the game has almost been out for a year and connectivity a large portion of the game if you can t connect you can t play period 4 now i don t exactly know what to call it but we all will know what i m talking about you blow a wall to run outside and you rubber band back in heres another fantastic example i was streaming a few days back from this post date on plane i opened the door right outside of the bottom of cockpit staircase to peek a blackbeard sitting to the right low and behold i go out to peek and cannot go back in i keep getting rubber banded out i was essentially a uselss sitting duck for the rest of the game and this is not an isolated incident for me or anyone i play with this is a huge problem not being able to move through an area you breached a huge problem it could be the difference between winning and losing a match 5 for this next number i m just going to generalize the rest of the random bugs and issues that have been popping up on certain areas of certain maps shooting a drone will destroy every mute jammer on the map and give the person who shot the drone minus however many points for however many jammers were down on certain areas of certain maps shooting meleeing or breaking an object connected to the floor will destroy any and all ads systems which were attached to said floor at the same instance blitz s hitbox is still utterly broken they managed to somehow break grenade timers with the latest patch blowing up anywhere from instantly to the ususal 6 seconds later however ive heard this was patched already i cannot confirm it myself with every patch ubisoft makes they break something else instead of focusing souly on the problems they continue to push and push for skins and new operators and maps this is not okay this game used to be my go to game to play but as of skull rain i can hardly enjoy this game for its current state its more frustrating than not and i find myself treating it like the proper joke it is do i think this game could be much better yes do i strictly hate r6 s absolutely not i still hold this game close to my heart if these problems were fleshed out i d very much change my review and it d be an entirely different story if there wasn t a large abundance of problems with every patch or they broke a new thing with every patch i personally would not recommend paying the full 50 for this game until the biggest problems are fleshed out no game will be perfect i m 100 aware of that but siege is very very far below the acceptable threshold in my 700 hour opinion update red crow patch did not fix any of the important issues as promised
