2016 this game would have potential if the company behind it actually gave a about the game and not just about money the community is dead already on many gamemodes and i can t blame them you d think this game is still in beta if you played it full of game breaking bugs and the hitboxes are worse than ever before whenever there is an update all they seem to do is add extra content to the game where you can spend your money on this company never gave a about the community and i guess they never will to sum it all up for you guys bad hitboxes at times more than previous cod games laggy at times framedrops buggy random disconnects and graphical issues for many players updates are more about extra money generating content than actually fixing the game small community every game i play i see at least 4 people i know majority of the community are just a bunch of raging kids same as at least the last 5 games needs a high end system and still runs like if you have one results vary though they didn t balance the weapons properly shotguns and thermal dingo kids all over the place activision sometimes permabans people that never cheated in this game and never say why the dlc maps are only playable in limited gamemodes without the ability to play original maps they actually seem to ban cheaters if you send evidence to the right place the gameplay is fun if you actually find a lobby or get to play without issues or dingo kids cool weapon emblem and character customization optionsblack ops ii was the last proper game they made and times like modern warfare 1 and 2 are long gone the game reminds me more of cybermonkeys in space than the oldschool call of duty games the only reason i still play this is because of my clan and the fact that boii has almost no players at all i m praying to god that the upcoming remake of mw1 will be decent or else this game will be the last of my 6000 hour cod journey
