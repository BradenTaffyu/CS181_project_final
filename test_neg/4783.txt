cod hq is a crap show and the ui is a mess netcode is trash bought bo6 need to launch cod hq precaching shaders need to open bo6 through main page relaunches different game finally get into a game and it s the same crap it has been for years terribly optimised looks like it s 10 years old and plays crap no consistency in hitreg between matches a couple of games i dominated and i was bored out of my mind in the next game i m spawn killed within a second with enemies behind me i couldn t be bothered to try it further plenty of better games to play the whole notion of grinding to unlock attachments or other guns or perks is so dated simply rewards those who play more with an unfair advantage
