2020 i must say the experience is so bad that the chinese are so proud of cheating in a game with prime status i don t feel there are any actions on handling the cheaters to protect the gaming environment feeling sad for the other players trying so hard to improve their skills for those doubting that i met some chinese cheater but not somebody who acts like a chinese i guess their smooth simplified chinese is good evidence to prove they are the same nation of people i understand not every chinese player accepts this kind of bad game behavior feeling sad that their reputations are getting worse by those rude people with no sense besides i understand some of the chinese players may blame this comment and claim it is a baseless accusation i am not trying to argue anything as they don t have my experience and i don t have theirs i am just leaving the text area open for those with the same feelings
