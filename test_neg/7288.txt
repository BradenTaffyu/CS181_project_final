remove the micro transactions its a full price game on top of that it s a single player rpg where you want to immerse yourself fix the optimization horrible frames even with a rig higher than the recommended settings in the cities its just unplayable fluctuates between 33 to 45 so fast feels like 20 frames edit after 35 hours gameplay is great story is fine but i see mostly goblins everywhere need more mob variety at least 2 more types of bosses to fights
