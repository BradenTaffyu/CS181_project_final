2018 the game is extremely addicting but you will end up hating it and or hating yourself for the time you ve invested into it let me clarify below you ll have a massive amount of fun when first playing you ll probably experience the horror and adrenaline that this game was supposed to be filled with this releases those feel good endorphines and you queue up for another round this might go on for a couple weeks before you slowly start slipping unknowingly deeper and deeper into a game where the main theme is trying to interact with a killer who is actually a 6 year old with an incredibly fragile ego whose feelings are protected by their own ability to control every aspect of your enjoyment trust me when i say this killers do not want you to have fun their goal the entire time is to ensure you don t get to have any cool interactions in order to not feel their ego being threatened you ran from the killer and it took him over 30 seconds to finally catch up and down you he will consider this as toxic behavior and will camp tunnel you to ensure that you do not get to play or earn points for the rest of the game knowing you re desperately holding onto life by breaking your spacebar to prevent death as a hook is piercing through your helpless chest that bearded man with the ego of an orphaned child behind the keyboad is the one who controls whether you get to actually play the game or not do you know why this is because the game is designed to force killers to behave in this way if there are 4 good survivors against 1 bad killer or just 4 survivors who are abusing strong items perks it will seem disgustingly one sided and almost hopeless so the killer just resorts to being toxic themselves though this can be said for both sides huntress with one shot hatchets add on who ll probably get flamed by survivors for just playing the game the way the developers made it the game is just terribly balanced and people are forced to do things through the game s own toxic and asymetrical design no matter how good you are you will end up feeling defeated this is not horror this is cancer
