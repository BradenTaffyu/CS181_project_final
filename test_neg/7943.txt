2021 absolute train wreck of a game you can spend 10 hours on a single story line quest building up a hoard of treasure following maps and collecting enemy bounties and then at the very last moment when you turn in your treasure a group of level 100 player killers will come by murder you spawn kill you while they take all the treasure off your ship grief you and turn all of your 10 hour hard work in with absolutely nothing to prove the time you just put in all the while screaming profanities racial slurs and constant personal insults ok that s a very rare scenario one might say daily every single time you play you will be assaulted by other players it is guaranteed and they play just to other players so they re good at it so you can t play the games quests because they kill rape and pillage you and you cant fight back because they kill rape and pillage you so whats the solution switch servers nope no choice play off line nope you have no choice at least can i report the guy who stood on my ship in the one place that forces me to spawn directly underneath him lining me up for the perfect one shot one kill blunderbuss shot while repeated calling me a retarded n gger as i slowly despawn to at bare minimum try to discourage rampant player toxicity there s no report function the developers of this game gave absolutely no when considered toxic horrendous behavior and not only do they do nothing and watch they encourage it with the hundreds of thousands of complaints against the disgusting behavior in this game socially they take the hey yhat s the pirate life stance no this is a video game that people use to escape their lives because they want to be able to enjoy themselves for the 2 hours of minuscule free time they have when they get home from work before they have to get back on with their depressing life rut and slog back to work tomorrow if you re considering pass it this one up the repetitive game play and minor joy you get from pirate adventuring is insurmountably outweighed by the most toxic player base of griefers i have ever witnessed in a video game
