2022 i used to love this game it united my friends and me for over 500 hours of gameplay as for gameplay the game has lost much of its original charm as a swat simulator careful planning and tactics have been replaced by what are ultimately now superpowers in its early beginnings most of the abilities and operators were somewhat grounded in reality now many of the characters feel more like knock off marvel cops as they litteraly kool aid man through walls and punch with robotic arms add to the loss of realism the unfortunate reality that the game has been taken captive by ubisoft s woke messaging the company has spent three years subtly reworking maps to eliminate the presence of suicide bombers drugs and sex trafficking so that the maps can be played in china and pass their censors add to that the increased pandering to diversity inclusion as they explore its operators sexuality and gender identity the game is now unrecognizable from when it launched so many years ago it is an unfortunate loss i recommend that players who are seeking a swat experience instead spend their time on ready or not
