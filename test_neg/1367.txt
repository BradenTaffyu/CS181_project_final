2022 wonderful at first takes a nosedive once you start paying attention if you re here to complain about me playing this game more after reviewing someone in the comments pointed it out just fine all the other souls games have no online features and i enjoy coop multiplayer this game has gotten only worse the more i play it and i have finally uninstalled it this piece of crap game honestly my first 40 or so hours with this game were gorgeous i loved riding around the open world on the horse just faffing about and seeing the sights doing a small dungeon every now and then and throwing myself at the first few main story bosses then as time went on things started to feel off bosses get copy pasted around enemies get reused as mini dungeon bosses mini dungeon bosses become normal enemies and the further you get the more annoying the encounters become then it all culminates in castle sol at which point my honeymoon phase with this game just crashed and burned although to be fair this was already starting around leyndell and i started to see this game for what it really is a wonderful massive open world filled with filler and copy pasted with too few enemy types and bosses to populate even half the areas and encounter designs that remind me of dark souls 2 where killing you is more important than creating a challenge balancing in this game is whack the areas rarely fit your character s level and half the builds are simply not viable in the later game areas which was especially disappointing since from games like these kinda stand on the whole choose your own build principle the game seems to try to fix this by throwing handfuls of respec items at you bosses have chain attacks that hit stun you longer than their pause between attacks animations have unintuitive delays and very clear roll catch feints that were already annoying me in ds3 there s some attacks that wind up so slowly you can attack a boss multiple times between the opening tell and the attack going off and damage done by the late game bosses and enemies is so stupendous that leveling vigor is now as important as leveling adp was in ds2 you either do it or you don t get to play the game late game encounters are also not enjoyable at all the later areas are usually filled with enemy spam summoning enemies enemies that have infinite stamina and aggression high poise and ridiculous damage enemies hiding around each and every corner very powerful miniboss enemies grouped up with jobbers enemies that are programmed to try to push you off ledges all of the childish haha we killed you things and in the end i would prefer just running past the reused enemies since fighting them was not going to benefit me at all one of the things about this game that annoys me the most is how it subtly lies to you about its own design malenia s healing strikes also heal when she hits your shield which is entirely counterintuitive to a mechanic like that which usually works like lifesteal where she heals when she does damage mohg s curse can be negated by a wondrous physik tear except the tear barely works and he still gets to heal most of his health and do some damage and you can t roll through any of the curse animations there s some hero s dungeons that have dark phantom versions of enemies you need to lure onto seals of holy light to undo their invulnerability except using holy attacks doesn t work on them this is especially annoying as from is expected to pay attention to detail and reward observant players both the phantom and chariot versions of the hero s dungeons are awful btw and the godskin duo fight pretends to be throne watcher defender where if you kill one the other summons them back except if you kill both in quick succession they just get summoned back anyways without either of them needing to execute a summon animation i feel like mentally engaging with this game is just a waste of effort and since this is a fromsoft game that is incredibly disappointing this game could have been wonderful but it collapsed under its own scope the map is so big and they wanted to fill it with so many small dungeons and gaols and encounters that they ended up having to copy even main story bosses mohg astel godrick loretta gets used twice so does margit and morgott is just margit with some extra moves same for niall and o neill just to fill them with it s embarrassing and this game is nowhere near as good as you ll hear in general discourse about it as a bit of a qualifier i will add i have beaten all the main bosses including malenia collected all of the great runes put god knows how many hours into this game and think i have a pretty okay grasp on most of the boss s patterns and timings i have beaten the final boss es and the only boss i used online coop to beat was the actual mohg fight the one with the curse of blood since i was simply not going to deal with that i enjoy some things about this game there are a few bosses that i find magnificent radahn is one of the coolest thigns i ve ever encountered except they nerfed him for some reason maliketh is an incredibly well designed boss and lots of fun to fight godfrey and radagon are also really good fights and i still enjoy going back to help others fight them in coop and i can safely say that i find the open world gorgeous to look at and still enjoy riding around it on the horse sadly the rest of the game exists around these good aspects and drags everything down with it after thinking about it some more and reading some of the comments on this review i think i have some more thoughts to give they are more on the technical and engine side of criticising the game since i m running up against a character limit i will put them in a comment multiple comments
