2023 wh3 has been a disaster since launch especially when compared to the polish that was achieved towards the end of wh2 s life cycle the total war franchise has been my favorite series for close to 20 years i put in over 3 500 hours into the warhammer series and more than 10k toward wh2 tournament prizes because i loved the game but it is clear ca has lost the plot at this point don t support their greed by paying 150 more for a dlc that offers less regular patches should be the standard for this game but ca is instead holding the game s quality hostage behind dlc e g pay more and we ll finally fix the kroxigor recruitment for nakai don t buy it and we ll just have to stop supporting wh3 altogether ca take a page out of larian s book and start prioritizing game quality customer experience over your quarterly profit margin if y all continue down this path you won t have anyone left to buy the overpriced watered down poorly optimized uninspired and lazy content y all have been releasing post wh2 sure you might make more money on this dlc in the short term but the community won t put up with your blatantly avaricious business practices forever
