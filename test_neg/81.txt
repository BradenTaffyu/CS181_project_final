this may be the first time playing a steam game that i have ever felt an overwhelming need to post a negative review it is a shame that the current state of the game includes a major design flaw that ruins an otherwise stellar experience it is one that is so bad that i find it hard to press on playing after almost a week of play in the interest of fairness to the parts of the wukong development team that actually did a great job the following aspects of the game are deserving of its currently overwhelmingly positive review status pros enemy design combat sound music stability optimization voice acting english however the one team that absolutely did not live up to the level of quality that their peers delivered is the level design team not because the levels do not look good the environments look stunning not because there is no map or map overlay i have played other similar games with no map e g lies of p where the lack of a map did not bother me not because of the cryptic steps required to unlock secret areas elden ring did the same thing and while i did not like it it was not a deal breakerthe killing blow to the experience for this game is the boundary design this game should have never been released with this level of lazy implementation of player boundary design it is utterly inexcusable to price your game at the aaa level when it is clear that there was less effort put into player boundary design and qa testing than a nintendo 64 release navigating through levels in this game feels like walking through a 10 x10 glass corridor where you never know if you are going to smash your face on the the glass a few feet where a wall or drop in elevation appears to be or if said change in elevation is actually a path of progression cons inconsistency between level visuals and level boundaries boss arenas often contain player boundaries which do not also affect the boss boss arena boundaries sometimes seem to be a fraction of what the arena appears to bethe ever present level of inconsistency with visual indicators of game boundaries and the actual enforced game boundaries makes level navigation and exploration tedious at best i do not find it fun to brush up against or jump at everything that looks like a boundary in order to determine if it actually is this lack of visual consistency is a big letdown as many of the secret paths contain very useful rewards but the sheer tedium of brute force invisible wall testing is exhausting to the point where i no longer want to play the final insult thrust upon me by the level design team was in the 3rd chapter where after you fight a certain boss on a mountain path there is a shiny item on a nearby ledge after more than 30 minutes of trying to find a path to that area i discovered that you need to fall off of the edge of a nearby cliff to find a lower path which i found immensely insulting as the game spent the last 40 hours teaching me that cliff edges invisible walls but now i am supposed to ignore all of that and just try it because you know what it doesn t matter because i am not playing your game anymore if this ever gets fixed i will change my review and if on the infinitely unlikely chance that the wukong game director reads this review allow me to pose a hypothetical question for you if you went to a 5 star steakhouse and ordered their most expensive steak you receive the meal and it looks and smells wonderful but you find that you can not cut off a piece from the side the chef tells you that the outer 1 3 of the steak is inedible but you can cut from the middle you take a cut from the middle and it tastes well above your expectations the second cut from the middle also tastes just as good if not better but on your 3rd bite you taste nothing at all the chef then explains that 1 3 of the inner portion is inadvertently devoid of taste what kind of review would you leave for that restaurant editas a few people have noticed my gametime is increasing even though i stated above that i would no longer play the game in reality i am working on a mod which requires having the game executable open in order to inspect and query game assets i anticipate i am no more than a few weeks away from having that released and will post to nexusmods when it is ready however i am willing to make an implied agreement with this game studio whether they ever end up seeing this or not both you and i know how poorly the level bounds execution is in this game i have seen it and you are intimately familiar with it your ue landscape collision splines look fine and are only marginally overextended compared to the elevations that define them on the other hand the levelbounds boxcomponents and vector defined bgwblockingvolumes are atrocious it is almost as if there were two separate teams responsible for those your bounds often coverup areas that themselves have appropriate mesh collision which begs the question of why they were added in the first place now it is time for the deal if you beat me in releasing an update that addresses the substandard boundary implementation elements not only will i change my review to positive but i will also not release my mod or any videos which may expose the embarrassing level of quality on display in your boundary design i say this knowing full well that the audience i would reach would be miniscule but you never know it may end up reaching someone who actually does have an audience and they may run with it updateso i have finished the initial version of the mod and now i can start playing without being distracted by invisible walls i will leave this review as is until this is fixed in game without needing to install a mod if when that happens i will change this review to recommends mod is available on nexus mods
