2022 i hope i m wrong the first two hours of this game left a bad impression on me a cheap game like ds2 poorly designed levels and enemies andi am getting stuttering like crazy no matter what settings update after 150 hours the first 30 hours the game is kind of fun but then it becomes boring after that why bc rpg mechanics are the problemlet s take a step back and compare the game to zelda botwyou can go anywhere in zelda without conditions unlike elden ring but that s not what matters for now why would you want to explore in zelda when you find a weapon or an item you can immediately use it and enjoy the adventure elden ring is limited by its rpg mechanics which makes it very different with zelda the player is immediately rewarded and his exploration time is estimated with elden ring the player is given a weapon or an item that does not work with his build not to mention repeating the same area and the same bosses btw elden ring has more than 150 boss but it s actually a 20 bosses repeated i believe that if they had used the same progression system in the surge 2 this game would have been the game of the generation
