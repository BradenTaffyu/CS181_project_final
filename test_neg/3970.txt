2017 after 3 years of playing gta v on both xbox and pc and putting in hundreds of hours into the game rockstar unfairly banned my account for using mods on singleplayer and reset all of my character progress i had to grind and grind to make money because rockstar wants players to buy their vastly overpriced shark cards and i along with other people with high cash balances was unjustly banned and lost it all support tickets i submitted were ignored and met with the same copy and paste responses repeating their ban policy after this ordeal i am probably never going to buy another rockstar affiliated product they don t care about their players or customers they only want to make money
