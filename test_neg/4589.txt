2021 the pinnacle of unfulfilled promise warframe in its current state is a grindy and boring as hell game to play it wasn t always that way of course but to do bloated updates and various other problems the game is as wide as an ocean shallow as a puddle the game will ask you to spend hours to weeks grinding out it s content with you only being awarded an underwhelming weapon s and or warframe not all is bad with warframe the parkour movement mechanics are very fun to play around and use many warframes have unique abilities such as mag who can use the power of magnetism to trap enemies in a bubble full of bullets various kinds of weapons are fun to use as well like many of the exotic bio weapons the a i is very brain dead and hardly ever reacts to the player s capability to jump around and attack from above or from the side all too often the a i will simply walk around and blindly shoot at your general area as well as chucking grenades at you if you stand still for too long the healer enemies are also quite possibly the most annoying enemy next to energy drainers i couldn t and wouldn t recommend this game for anyone despite it being free to play it s fun for a couple hundred hours but good luck after that
