2017 do you want an online gaming experience where you have to either grind for months or spend real money to have enough in game cash for the car house or even the gun you want do you want an online gaming experience where the entire playerbase only exists to prevent you from grinding effectively do you want an online gaming experience full of hackers who will randomly and illegally give you and everyone else free money just because they can do you want an online gaming experience where paranoia over said hackers causes the devs to randomly and without warning adjust read steal millions of dollars out of your in game account even if you earned it legitimately or bought it directly from them do you want an online gaming experience where confronting the devs on their forums about this leads to them blocking your account and banning you from the servers of course not because you re not a moron stay away from this mess edit okay so i feel like there s been a bit of confusion over what exactly happened so let me describe the situation to the best of my abilities i had 6 million dollars i didn t buy a shark card i didn t hack i didn t exploit i grinded for several hours using the methlab to get 6 million dollars legitimately i was going for 10 million so i could buy a yacht stupid investment i know but i really wanted that damn boat and i woke up one morning and got a message that said that rockstar noticed an anomalous cashflow pattern in my account and they had adjusted it accordingly all my money except for about 2000 was gone i got in contact with a customer service rep on the forums and she informed me that the server reported that i was earning way too much money way too quickly to be playing legitimately and told me that if i wanted my money back i should just buy a shark card she refused to give me back my money refused to transfer me to a superior and warned me that if i didn t drop the issue i would be banned for cheating admittedly at this point i started testing her so she left the chat and when i tried to contact another customer service rep i was unable to because as expected i was permanently banned from the rockstar forums i also received a 2 month ban from gta online i know the singleplayer s good i know the game is polished and i know that i m not the best player out there this isn t about any of that this is about a large game company using microtransactions to effectively hold hours worth of hard work for ransom rockstar has gone down the path of ea and ubisoft in how much they treat their customers like dirt and i don t want to just stand by and watch helplessly i know this review isn t going to do anything but it s better than doing nothing
