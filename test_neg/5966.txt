2017 sigh this is the hardest review i ve had to write this game is interesting compelling and original the game mechanic is great the core game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way i ve never experienced even in metal gear games its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer unfortunately the game is riddled with bugs this current update 2 13 2017 made the game unplayable and that s not me about minor changes in game play mechanics its literally broken and won t launch i ve held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down welp the cows have come to pasture and i feel that after playing 120 hours of the game posting on steam forums about bugs participating in test servers and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think i ve earned the right to about it hell i m a paying consumer so why not yesterday i played this game almost all day and night long in that day after hearing about the new patch i logged every game i was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors my logs for yesterday are as follows 68 attempted games played51 games that did not load crashed errored out etc 17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were playedthat means the application worked correctly only 25 of the time all i can say is to stay away from this game its not working anymore and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times if you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as i did when it decides to work put pressure on those devs thier game as fun as it may be is a defective product it needs to be fixed or we need to be reimbursed you pay thier salary not behavior not starbreeze you ps devs i will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should it is not my intention to keep people from buying your games it is only to keep people from buying broken games pps devs after fixing this game how likely would it be to see another crossover monster survivor combo i really wanna see a ripley xenomorph or james sunderland pyrimid head update just play konami for the license you its dirt cheap right now
