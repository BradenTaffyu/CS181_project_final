2023 i ve played every cod besides cold war and i can confidently say this is single handedly the worst call of duty in the entire franchise weapon level up and camos feel like a scavenger hunt why do i have to use a weapon to unlock a different weapon to unlock a different weapon to unlock an attachment for a weapon of an entirely different category maps are the worst they have ever been and its exaggerated by the fact that the time to kill is so low it s so low it encourages camping and full aiming around every corner making the game feel like an rps against opponents edit while trying to finish a stupid twitter montage they added a few maps that make the game playable the new dome is good expo is great black gold is good and they brought back the only good base game map museum still outside of these maps the game is in an almost unplayble state incredibly frustrating but i m glad that i can have a little bit of fun now edit 2 they nerfed the time to kill and added a lot of great maps the 2 things i hated most about the game its ok now
