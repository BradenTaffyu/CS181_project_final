2023 the designers insist on game design decisions based on a game ideal they have in their head the result is a severely toxic environment where you either like pvp and sabotaging others or you re punished for not liking it mmo s 30 years ago figured out how and why this approach doesn t work and only benefits the most aggressive and oppressive part of the community yet as with every other aspect of the game that s needed changing over the years the devs believe they know better adding pve servers wouldn t result in dead servers as some defenders would imply it d give a space for people that otherwise just wouldn t play and a more positive experience for those who are starved enough for a decent piracy game made in the last 10 years to get into a pvp environment despite not having any interest in the pvp content if you force pve players into pvp all you re doing is giving easy pickings to people who like pvp it s not engaging for the pvper doesn t test their skills and it s a negative experience for the pve player the only reason a pvp player would want pve players in their very limited servers is to bully people or an alternative option if they re too unskilled to engage with anyone actually interested in pvp it benefits only the least admirable part of the community and i don t understand why the slur spewing toxic part of the community needs a leg up why do pve players have to pay the price for the enjoyment of a volatile subsection of pvp players it s a bizarre choice when on the other hand they ll censor words as benign as hangman brief side mention that the game is designed to be aggressive to solo players the only way to really play on your own is to be avoidant or prey on other solo players anything else and you are violently outclassed by design that aside the game has been out for years yet still has routine bugs that go from obnoxious to game breaking be it crashing old accounts having consistently more issues so loyal early adopters are punished for believing in the team textures refusing to load at all flying ships unkillable krakens texture breaking in story mode physics launching your ship into the sky for parking too close to a dock and more i m sure i forgot the monetization is cosmetic but as there s hardly any goal in game beyond cosmetics you can say that short of pay to win the game is 100 monetized and aggressively so enjoy paying between 15 20 bucks for one decent ship design which isn t impossible to get ingame but it relies on waiting on islands for hours to have a chance at getting the equivalent of maybe a dollar s worth of premium currency if you catch it in time this is a game that has solely survived on the hopes and dreams of millions desperate for a good game about piracy which as a theme have ironically been a desert with the rare oasis and no consistency in genre a hole they fill marginally for the time though with luck not for much longer if you have 3 friends that show up consistently you might circumvent a lot of the cruelty designed into the game levelled at pve and especially solo players otherwise avoid this game it scratches the pirate itch but it does so clumsily with many price tags and a blatant disregard for your time or enjoyment edit they added pve servers where you can t engage with most of the mechanics the few you can naturally make the progression 3 3x as grindy this only really makes the servers where you can engage them more toxic as a result it s like a sneering apology hissed through gritted teeth and does more harm than good to pve players it s an insult rather than a compromise
