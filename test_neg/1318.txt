2023 amazing game i m quite in love with it i m editing this review later on into a proper one but i m leaving a negative review because bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america there s no excuse for these prices since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries so i m putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization and for all my south american friends out there who can t pay for it just play the jack sparrow version don t let them get away with it
