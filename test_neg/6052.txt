2022 with nearly 300 hours on this game here s what i can say the best way to play this game as either side is to stay at low rank anything below bronze everyone around that area is mostly balanced for skill level some games you ll steamroll and others you ll get stomped if you win be humble about it once you get to bronze everyone is fully adapted to the meta not giving you any room to have fun if you play killer prepare to be bullied by survivors who are trying to have fun at your expense as a killer you will be screwed over by about 1 3 of all maps in the game and the survivors will exploit fair game mechanics to anger you everytime they constantly slip through your fingers even by a little they will rub it in survivors want you to feel bad about yourself like you re a real pos who s terrible at this game and it will work you ll get pissed off you ll play sloppy and you ll look for the strongest killers and the best perks in the hope that you can smash them into the ground for their bullying and if survivors open up the exit gates they will wait for you to get close teabag at you click their little flashlights point or just stand right at the exit so you can pointlessly hit them survivors are the best example of what makes a toxic playerbase as a survivor you will run into killers who have suffered at the hands of these toxic survivors and they ll take it out on you due to dbd not having any sort of targeted matchmaking they can t simply take on the same survivors again for revenge they need a win because they ve been abused and bullied by survivors you ll get stuck with clueless selfish and potentially troll teammates that will purposefully get you killed and it ll piss you off it won t seem fair that you got singled out or that your teammate body blocked you so the killer could hit you or that they hide in a bush all game while you try and do all the objectives then escape while you distract the killer and die in dead by daylight you re either the bully or you re the one being bullied it s a game of mental abuse of high blood pressure and it s by design so if you re a level headed individual who isn t easily affected by obvious troll tactics and mockery please come and play dbd the community needs more people like you if you re humble and don t need to rub in every victory you have over others come play dbd if you re a good sport come play dbd if your idea of fun is playing a game of tag with someone then turning around to flip them off everytime they lunge for you and miss we don t want you you re a bully and everyone would be better off without your company
