do you like grinding for 3 6 drop chances do you like combat that feels floaty and your early game is nothing but others clearing all the content bosses for you in an instant like to stare at walls for 2 hours repeating the same mini game only to get nothing for it like to play a character only to realize in group content your character is useless like dodging that feels like you re stuck on a rail as soon as you hit roll like jumps that reach no height and grappling hook mechanic that feels like it was made for a game in the early 2000 s like gunplay well 90 of the guns are ignored in this game and only a handful are used hope you like using the same gun everyone else is using and chasing meta only 3 characters are valued and played end game so i hope you don t like playing creating unique characters or builds people will literally leave group content if you re not a meta character in dungeons and other content you can t even shoot enemies because a bunny character clears all content before you even reach the enemy hope you also like drip fed content this is an mmosg without the massive part and sg standing for shooter grinder you grind endlessly for minimal power increases while being toyed by the cash shop short cuts all along the way the cash shop contains in game currency shards mods 30 boosts to all drops and characters that would take you 100 s of hours to grind all with the power of the credit card the most vocal defender of this game is usually the credit card warrior even catalysts and energy activators can just be bought with real money while their material drops are 6 and 20 and take 38 hours and 8 hours to make this game is 100 pay to win thing is though i love and can endure massive grind however in this game i found myself dozing off in the middle of a dungeon run because of how dull the combat is i would sometimes just have to stop playing for the night because i feel so tired running in place at the time i made my first negative review i was only less than 20 hours in and i spent another 380 hours and i can tell you the gameplay doesn t change at all the more you play you are just farming more characters in pretty gold rimmed skins you chase the meta characters for bossing and farming so you can make them as fast as possible the stronger you become the more same content you continue to repeat the only thing that changes with more grind is the numbers on your screen and the enemies that absorb said numbers their newest hardest difficulty boss ramped up boss damage so hard that no amount of defense protected you from getting one shot this is all telling that the developers have no idea how to balance a game when defense feels useless and only 3 characters are played end game i don t enjoy this kind of gameplay loop and i gotta warn others like me who are on the fence about this game that perhaps they ll give it a go you ll spend hundreds of hours repeating the same things just to brute force a drop i ve done the same in games like monster hunter but the combat in those games is invigorating challenging and full of variety and excitement of pulling something amazing off the warning is also for addictive gambling this game can get you hooked just like those phone games by making you feel like you have to return every x amount of hours to put a new research going or to do a season challenges because they are all time gated if you don t you get that awful feeling of missing out and that you ve wasted all your hours playing if you don t keep playing truth is the more you play the more of your time you re wasting in this game that has already lost a sizeable amount of it s players how does the game change from normal to hard the only thing that changes from normal mode to hard mode is 3 drop chances become 6 but you can do hard mode private dungeon runs most can t do these without heavy investment or meta character bunny to try and get another 20 chance drop after a long run to increase that 6 into 12 ultimately it doesn t change the grind at all and makes it even more about gambling hard mode dungeons start off difficult but if you make an ultimate bunny and deck them in a good reactor and trans module she can solo all of the hard dungeons and you can do this in private and earn double amps soon they will make this more of a group thing but i can guarantee you that you will still only play bunny in these dungeons because they will rush ahead of you kill everything and you ll be walking behind them trying to catch up if you unlock the best weapon and character s does the gameplay change nope the best grinds in this game are where people are literally running in circles like a bunch of gerbils stuck in a wheel as bunnies of course void reactor shard farming is literally sitting in one spot all the time staring at a wall for a timer to run out and doing dungeon runs is insanely boring because the only character that does them in a timely manner is bunny the game changes if you use another buffed up character that isn t meta but eventually you just feel cheated because you ve been forced to the side lines to play alone solo because you aren t a bunny is hard mode hard the game doesn t change much from normal as long as you stack 30k to 50k def and have 6 10k hp you re safely surviving most content in hard mode and the game stays exactly the same it did in normal grinding the necessary items for that kind of defense and health takes a day of your time at best it s only a few cheap bosses with multishot mechanics that still one shot you and the last group bosses that also require an investment in a weapon or a meta character lepic or gley for damage otherwise you will not clear them holy crap well did you like anything about the game the only thing as a monster hunter player i enjoyed in the beginning were the boss fights as an ajax character who focused on helping the team with shields that was until i realized there s 2 characters that cheese almost all boss fights and the fun stopped quickly because i didn t have said cheese character at first i stopped playing the character i liked and focused on making a meta character only to find out it wasn t satisfying at all i went from being a game where i used my gun attacked weak spots avoided damage helped team mates up to hit 2 buttons roll and hold my fire i still continued to try and make my ajax better and better but no matter what i upgraded i couldn t become a dps character because the end game gluttony boss one shot me despite having over 50 000 points hp shield and 40 000 defense all because the developers will never balance characters and will just ramp up the monsters meaning you are forced to just play meta characters forever anything else that s good the music is great graphics are a bit overdone tech vibe but still beautiful enemy variety is there but a bunny can just sprint past 90 of the enemies and kill them so variety makes no difference and doesn t matter at all i actually like the bodacious bodies of the women and their sexual outfits i m glad to see this on the gaming market making an apprearance as the western gaming market is filled with women that look like men and men that act like morons also this game has zero woke garbage or current day american politics which is a welcome change not to have to hear the liberal american left inflitrating into the gaming athmosphere to push some political agenda
