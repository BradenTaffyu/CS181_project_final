still not worth playing compared to total war warhammer ii the unit ai is still awful compared to previous entries units require far too much babysitting and will easily get distracted and lose previous orders ranged units feel extremely unresponsive and cavalry charges are easily stopped by single generic mounted heroes that clog up entire units i m not sure what changed in this entry previous tw games certainly aren t perfect but the series has never felt this clunky i d love to give this game a positive review as the new factions are a lot of fun cathay and slaanesh have some of my favorite rosters in the franchise however it feels so unnecessarily annoying to play compared to previous tw games even after nearly two years of patches and 165 hours i still cannot recommend this game
