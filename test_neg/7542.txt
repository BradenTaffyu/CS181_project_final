2023 original review my younger sister has been playing sot on and off for years now she finally convinced me to purchase the game a few weeks ago since i ve played for over 100 hours reached pirate legend and have really enjoyed my voyages on the seas the game is filled with content and things to do beautiful places and in depth stories but actually enjoying the story and pve aspects of sot is almost impossible not knowing the tricks and tips that the well versed community have access too as a new player can make the game seem impossible to play i was shocked that the servers were not skill or level based match making because of this it is somewhat annoying that you cant have private servers or even just pve servers while i understand where some of the concerns come from within the pro pvp community of sot i do not see how adding a pve side to the game would hurt sot if anything i think it would make the pvp aspect better by filtering out the players who are sailing to enjoy the lore and don t want to involve themselves in the pvp aspect which is totally valid and okay as a new player i really don t think i d recommend getting this game to others it is hard to get into without help especially if many of the players sharing your servers do not respect the pirate code the toxicity that some of these seasoned players show is disheartening and unwelcoming to newcomers while i have met a handful of fun and nice players over the last few weeks the bad experiences overshadow the good ones i hope that with safer seas being implemented we will see more changes for pve players and in general a more enjoyable experience for everyone update now that safer seas has been out for a while i think it s fair to say that many people within the community are disappointed for a lot of us safer seas was a lifeline for this game many of us were holding onto the hope that we could finally enjoy the game but i haven t wanted to play sot since safer seas released with no real reward for grinding not being able to use your own ships not being able to co op with other friendly pirates and being extremely limited on what you can and cant do ruins any fun aspects that the game had left i only started playing at the beginning of season 10 i obsessed over this game until safer seas released only because i was counting on the fact safer seas would be better and more enjoyable gameplay for someone like myself i can t even bring myself to log into the game anymore as it as tremendously boring while i enjoyed my time on the high seas pvp its not something that i want do all the time and i think players should be able to enjoy sea of thieves in both peaceful and pvp settings almost all other games have some form of pve or non friendly fire servers i hope that as safer seas ages changes are made to include the peaceful community
