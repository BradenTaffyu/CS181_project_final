2014 pros nice graphicsgreat variety of warframes and weaponsand it s free cons ninjas play free more like mindless drones collecting resources so they can make better gear to collect more resources with play free even though the game is free to play there is only very little you can t buy with real money as in you can either spend 3 4 days depending on how much do you play farming for resources to get a new warframe character class and then spend another 2 3 days building it or you can just buy it for 20 dollarsthe game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it want a pet you can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet usually found in quantities of 4 per mission then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures or you can throw money at the game to bypass all this but that s not all if you happen to not play the game for a while your pet will die because you have to feed it with item that costs quite a lot of credits there was also a new resource introduced some time ago which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grindcash shop is incredibly overpriced 40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons out of which only one is good and a color palette weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice coincidence maybe those color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store the game is focused on grinding and farming if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectivelygame is intentionally gear based literally no amount of skill can help you if you don t have good gear modsbosses are just bullet sponges with the weakspot mechanicdrop tables are diluted especially when new gear comes outgames are hosted on players computers so expect heavy lag and common disconnectstl drif you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again this game is probably for you on the other hand if you don t like being ripped off by greedy developer you should look somewhere else
