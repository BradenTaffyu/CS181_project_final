2023 despite all the hours i have put and will put into the game i genuinely can t recommend it it s like dark souls on crack and the difference is that this is a rougelite this game wants you to die except there s no saves you die to 1 pixel of acid you didn t see in half a second after exploring 3 parallel worlds and beating the boss 6 hours into a run lol get i ve had more bad experience with this game than good and i just can t in good faith write a good review just git gud is impossible in a game that relies probably 80 on rng with a casual run takes 2 3 hours if you re not speeding through
