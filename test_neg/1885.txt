2023 product received for free i give large props for the free play across the 4 days i racked up a fair amount of hours and just about all i needed to know that i will maybe buy this game in the future for a really heavy discount this is a true sequel in that it is much the same game which is great but also it has the same huge issue that total war 2 has the ai is pyschic they know when they ll win they know when you ll lose they know when you move this is particularly problematic losing the ability to have walls in your non capitals the only saving grace in tw2 was being able to turtle and rush walls so you ll at least get one turn generally to stop a army that wiggled it s way through your vision at march speed knowing you couldn t catch it this is also particularly sad because capital battles basically don t happen they only did happen before because if everything is wall d they re going to attack somewhere now they just will avoid your walled cities like the plague until they can out number you in a hilarious degree as a point to this i beat the entire campaign without one capital battle not one coming from shogun total war 2 that is so sad base defenses were a huge part of what made total war amazing some good notes they made several good changes to things like diplomacy giving things point values so you don t have to guess see where your ai friends were routing defending etc made enemy heroes not gods yea i m talking about you grimgor and several others from tw2 several other improvements were definitely noticable being able to trade settles to from your empire is massive most of the lords were boring and pretty weak slaneesh faction was silly op everyone was my friend or my vassel letting me pick and choose who i want to murder the issue comes down to the fact that it s just boring auto resolve will be right 95 of the time and mean there is no real reason for you to fight a battle nearly all the campaign people don t even have another legendary lord to confederate with and just one unique gear quest to do idk it s not a horrible game and they did make some positive changes but i find very little reason to buy play this over tw2
