2018 this is a game that seems fun when you first look at it you can play through a story by yourself or play online with friends i rarely touched the story mode since i was in it for the online gameplay i had friends to play with and i convinced two of my friends to buy it because they wanted to play it with me i was on my best behavior in the game i tended to play with just my friends in public sessions because so much of the community is toxic waste this is worsened by the game having absolutely garbage pvp you start off without good armor and the best armor is still trash low health and weak weapons if you have noone to play with early on this game is brutal you will be destroyed by people with either more time and progress in the game people with more real life money and or the endless supply of modders godmodding trapping and killing people this problem tends to not end even when you get better weapons armor and vehicles because no matter what explosive bullets will forever be broken as all hell a hydra the game s version of the harrior with explosive bullets will destory anything armored vehicles are nothing against a barrage even the tankiest vehicles including tanks will be destroyed within a few seconds or less thus it is really pointless to try and make money outside of heists if you don t know the trick to empty out sessions also whenever i encountered a modder i would do my best to report them in hopes that it would help stop the rampant modding that happens i really did have fun playing but rockstar decided that i shouldn t be allowed to have fun without any explaination nor reason i was banned from gta online with nearly 500 hours of time and effort invested in the game gone to waste i try to contact rockstar because surely i can prove i m innocent and maybe just maybe i could get everything back and enjoy this game with my friends again nope rockstar support is just a pile of they automatically closed my ticket where i asked them to review my gameplay and tell me what i did wrong i am still confident that if they did that instead of relying on their garbage automated system which the rampant modding clearly shows how badly it fails to work they would see that no violation occurred but they are too busy rolling in their money to give a care about the consumer stay far far away from rockstar and anything they make this is a company that deserves nothing but bankruptcy they will take your money time and energy then punch you in the stomach without warning nor reason while walking away with everything you put into the game please for the love of all that is good put your money elsewhere never spend a single cent on rockstar i hope that their actions one day give them the consequences they deserve edit i have been unbanned and my progress was kept as is however i m not going easy on rockstar the way they handled the situation not publically admitting an issue and having no communication with users on social media was poor and i was not even notified my ban was removed while i will return to the game once i know the false positive issue is completely resolved my trust is something that has to be earned if rockstar goes above and beyond with how they treat us their customers then i will be more than happy to give them a positive review and sing of their praise until then i will continue to warn people of how they treat customers
