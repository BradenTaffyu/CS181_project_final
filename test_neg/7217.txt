i ve been really chewing on whether i d give this game a thumbs up or down and i think i have to say it s gonna be a thumbs down but it was close honestly the game got me to play it for 60 hours and i was tempted to start another playthrough just to max out my last few vocations i had to uninstall lest i be sucked in again i didn t have any technical issues besides frame rate drops in major cities those were annoying but not showstoppers positives the vocations are interesting they all play very differently and there s no real harm in mixing and matching however you want there s not really a meta you have to hit just do what s fun the graphics are largely pretty good magic effects look great and the monster animations are solid there are some nice vistas in the game but most of the time is spent in the dark or in forests or canyons where you can t see much taking down a large monster feels like an accomplishment especially a drake the hidden world at the end was a nice touch even if it was also kind of a letdown upgrading your gear and getting new skills to use and master felt great the whole way through it was fun addicting enough to get me to keep playing despite my constant state of severe frustration i liked sven he was interesting and had a fun character arc negatives the way this game pads its playtime is with endless amounts of stupid bs so many fights just felt cheap and frustrating because they re designed to be obnoxious one example i m on a game necessary important escort quest on foot of course a random encounter dragon shows up and kills the vital npc quest is now ruined game unwinnable mostly you can revive dead npcs with rare items but i was all out of them i had to scour the map to find just one more rush back to the corpse of the npc revive her and hope the quest could continue it did this took hours and i hated every minute of it nothing adds to the joy of an escort quest like an npc too stupid to hide from a dragon and they are all too stupid they re also usually slow too meaning you can outrun them and fail the quest but that s not all monsters tend to come in packs and they re absolutely everywhere every twenty feet it s another fight wolves harpies bandits wolves again goblins bandits troll on and on and on the same tiresome fights dozens of them any time you have to walk somewhere which is always that s all this game is long walks through murder tunnels speaking of stupid bs every time you take damage your max health goes down a little this gets really old when they dump a boss on you during the first 3rd of the trip then another one near the end that you can t fight anymore because after 30 encounters your max health is like 15 of normal and same with all your pawns it even does this if you die and reload you reload with less max health it adds difficulty sure but mostly it just adds stress and makes the game feel like more of a chore than it should the map feels small no matter what color they make it it s just a long series of tunnels there s nothing open here no wide fields and forests just roads and caves and canyons it feels incredibly constrained sure it s large in the sense that it takes forever to run from a to b but that s because there were 20 fights and the road was lined with short cut preventing cliffs at all times it feels constrained the whole way through claustrophobic even you only get to use with 4 skills from your class despite a big list to choose from so pick ones you want to use 100 000 times wayfarer vocation is bafflingly stupid game design equip many weapons only get 3 skills total so don t bother with another set of weapons just be a worse archer or whatever if you play it the pawns never shut up never they re either complaining or repeating unneeded advice always so many of the npc faces are terrible 100 of the children look monstrous and deformed like the game devs have never seen an actual living child before most human adults are weird and ugly all the cat people are fine but they re just cat faces incredibly disappointing romance sure you can be very good friends with any npc in the game but you can t actually have a relationship there s no love cutscene no marriage no your reward is an escort quest that s right they come and ask you to take them somewhere once you get there nothing happens they just say thanks this aspect of the game is so pathetic i don t know why they even bothered don t get me started on the brothel not that many big monsters you run through the list real quick and your 50th cyclops isn t a very interesting fight and the boss fights tend to be long too which is cool until it s your 10th dragon or 20th gryphon weight and inventory management i know this is in every game but they have a tradeoff if you play as a small character you re faster and nimble but you can t carry more than a deck of cards before you re dragging your feet and begging to rest worrying about being overburdened every time you pick up a flower is not fun the music is boring dragon s dogma had outstanding music esp bitterblack isle overall it feels like this game was close to being really good but falls short in so many ways it s bad overall there were just too many times where i was actively angry at whatever i was doing for me to recommend it
