game is fantastic but due to the wipe after each season this game is a big no sadly i cannot recommend it because of this sole reason as it will most likely make a lot of players with a life career family leave the game people don t have the time to level again and again each season it s fine in a game like d3 where you can hit max level in 10 minutes but not here i will play the first season cause i like the game a lot but if the wipe thing doesn t change i m not gonna stay
