2022 a brief summaryelden ring is an open world soulslike with solid mechanics great level design and fantastic customization unfortunately the game has balancing issues that turn the early game into a slog and combat while built on solid mechanics that is often needlessly difficult and unfair at times while i personally enjoyed the game i don t think i d recommend it gameplaythe basicsit s dark souls with a fresh coat of paint and a jump button this means third person combat usually melee in which the player learns and masters the patterns of enemies to best defend and retaliate against them swinging one s weapon blocking and dodging all require stamina leaving the player vulnerable if they overextend lastly the player is only ever a few hits from death rarely more than ten but can heal with potions if they find an opening in which to use them these games carry a reputation for being challenging having sufficient depth to require a certain mastery from the player elden ring changes the formula slightly with the addition of jumping as both an offensive and defensive tool additionally repeated hits on an enemy in a short time frame will knock it down for a critical attack returning souls players will also find that weapons require far less stamina to swing increasing player agency substantially explorationstormveil castle the raya lucaria academy and so many more while the side dungeons may vary in quality the main ones are exceptional there are several routes through which to reach the end often with breathtaking landmarks to keep you oriented and hint at where you ll go next the areas are massive but naturally segmented with checkpoints and shortcuts finally they re packed with items secrets and enemies picking up the pace from the slower world outside the world at large naturally isn t as dense as the main dungeons that said it still has the handcrafted feel with many points of interest and encounters strewn across it customizationplayers level up using runes slowly growing attributes of their choosing vigor mind and endurance boost health focus and stamina everything else determines what types of equipment you can use strength for big swords faith for incantations importantly the game has the runtime to allow for players to allocate enough points to explore multiple options in their character build as far as options are concerned there are several categories of weapons with a large portion of them having special attacks and traits to distinguish them there are a variety of spells with widely ranging requirements many of which are low enough to support otherwise purely physical builds last but not least are ashes of war which can be applied to weapons to alter their movesets and infuse them with different properties all in all the customization is fantastic with a great many choices of viable options multiplayeras of now the game suffers from serious connectivity issues with players disconnecting from each other at random provided they can connect at all when it finally does work you ll normally get invaded by someone with an optimized bleed or madness build no fun allowed who can full to zero you off of one or two hits that said pvp is the best it s ever been in a souls game ignoring them the fantastic diversity in weapons and skills means that cooperators will be able to compliment each other s builds almost always beating out npc summons as a note it s a waste of time outside of dungeons since you ll have to explore on foot co op though it doesn t often work makes dungeons more fun and can make even the worst fights manageable writingwhat writing the premise was never properly defined or motivated with the introductory slideshow sharing little of value the characters were promising before they disappeared for good i read my item descriptions and explored as best i could but after it all the world feels empty devoid of stories my character has no place in the world no past nor connections what s this elden ring and why does everyone want it who s this person who levels me up frankly i couldn t tell you nor will the game try to shortcomingsnumbersto upgrade a regular weapon to the maximum the player will require 96 smithing stones of varying tiers i used over 900 smithing stones on weapons costing me something in the ballpark of 1 2 million runes on upgrades overall to put that in perspective that s enough to level a player from level 1 to 83 or 83 to 105 late game ignoring the fact that smithing stones are rare to the point that you might not find enough to fully upgrade one weapon let alone ten the shortage of runes in the early game is especially bad with full dungeons failing to provide the runes for a single level why s this matter firstly enemies across the board have high stats and are scaled up considerably with each new area my character durable first fun second and threatening last was physically incapable of killing many late game bosses that said anything less than that high durability was susceptible to one hit kills in higher leveled areas as such it s often numbers that force players away from the main dungeons and with the relative scarcity of both runes and smithing stones it can be days before a player is strong enough to return that is to say that progress is frequently held back by a lack of what is effectively grinding rather than mechanical mastery ctrl c ctrl vbesting a giant the first time is exhilarating the fiftieth one won t meaningfully differ from the one before it yes there are a lot of enemy types but not enough to make side areas distinctive side dungeons feel the same due to similar architecture and enemy types not to mention the repeat boss fights all while lacking any discernible narrative significance most rewards are stone sword keys and crafting materials which aren t any good on their own lacking narrative intrigue and meaningful powerups to help the player overcome adversity in the main areas the world at large beautiful as it is feels empty boss fights are good unless the boss has overwhelming numbers requiring hundreds of hits to kill the boss has a practically undodgeable attack which governs the player s success there are multiple bosses whose attacks can and will overlap the boss is constantly running away and can t be hit in most cases the boss has inconsistent follow ups or is always attacking rendering player attacks unsafe that the player s only ever one or two mistakes from death isn t necessarily bad but there s a difference between the boss forcing a mistake with an undodgeable attack and the player actually making a mistake if it was just once or twice it wouldn t be so bad but it would seem that more often than not bosses check at least one item off the list if not two many of the boss fights can t be realistically beaten by the player alone requiring a second player or npc to share the worst of it all that said there are stellar bosses mixed in there only spaced tens of hours apart blocked mainly by poor boss fights the game was difficult all too often at the expense of being enjoyable conclusionit s not terrible but a lot of the game just wasn t much fun getting stuck on a boss for hours because i needed to go near perfect for minutes at a time only to return to a world that has long since lost its magic losing connection to my friends over and over hoping it d be better than the day prior was frustrating all the while i loved exploring the main dungeons and lambasting my friends for getting caught by the undodgeable attacks the core gameplay was good and the other sixty hours wasn t i had my fun but i can t say i d recommend it
