2019 they added an update that forces you to install the rockstar launcher in order to play the game quit holding games i paid for hostage because i don t want your terrible program on my pc never going to pay for a rockstar game again also online is a awful grind to nowhere to encourage microtransactions update as if to prove my point you can no longer buy gta4 because of the games for windows live bs that you had to install for that game seems like all these additional programs do is make things inconvenient for paying customers while pirates can still download and play all the gtas just fine
