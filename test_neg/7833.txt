2020 i wish there was a neutral review for games because that is what i would rate this in its current state pros graphics the game is beautiful in fact it is the best looking water sun and sky i have seen in a game the colors are vibrant and pleasing on the eye sailing sailing is meditative for me it almost feels real and listening to the ocean is relaxing pve quest they are enjoyable i really like finding a riddle in bottle and trying to solve it tall tales are great if you are able to complete them without people killing you digging up treasure and finding other items is also really fun cons forced pvp i understand what they were trying to go for but humans suck and they go out of their way to ruin your gameplay they either need to add pve servers private servers or allow you to host a game and have your friends connect people say doing this will ruin the game but they are wrong ark and 7 days to die do it and those games are doing just fine being killed in port there are pirate rules written on the wall when you first spawn in the pub that say all matters will be settled at sea well guess what people aren t following those rules if they don t want to make pve or private servers then make ports and islands neutral where you can t attack people or steal loot however once you get out into open sea it can become far game then that would be a test of skill for all these die hard pvpers then toxic community being killed is one thing but being harassed while it happens is another kids and even one time a kid and his dad were yelling and saying horrible things while killing my wife and i this is another reason for private servers pve servers or local host game play community in general i absolutely love everything about this game except the community we can t play without people attacking non stop and then you lose an hour or two of work and gain nothing you are always out numbered and no one and i mean no one will help you everyone just shoots at first sight there is zero cooperation in this game pvp would be fine if it was a fair fight 1v1 or 2v2 but it never is you are always outnumbered and those people think they are good at the game because four of them killed a solo sloop needs more pve needs more enemy types and more variety of quest the ones they have now are fun but they just need to add more to spice it up a bit my wife and i still want to play this game but if we continue to be killed and harassed we are just going to have to quit we just want to play a relaxing pirate game where we can hunt treasure and do quest i really hope they add pve because you are isolating a huge demographic of people that would pay to play your game be smart rare and add pve servers you will make more money this way other games do it and they are successful this game would be a 10 10 in my opinion but right now it s a 4 10 with the forced pvp way to stressful for people who just want to relax and treasure hunt after a long hard day of work update screw this game screw the toxic community and screw rare do not buy this game and support this type of behavior wife and i are uninstalling rare goes and creates private servers but no gold or rep farming why it doesn t impact anyone by playing solo or pve everything is cosmetic so who cares i could spend hundreds of hours just sailing around and treasure hunting by myself that is fun to me despite people telling me it would be boring they don t get to decide what i think is fun or not this game definitely needs some pve servers rare if you implement this i will return and even pay money in your in game shop because i do like some of the ship cosmetics but until then screw you and your toxic game you don t understand people at all give them pvp only and it will bring out the worst in people you don t even listen to the large community asking for pve terrible company overall score 4 10 with the potential to be a 10 10 with pve servers
