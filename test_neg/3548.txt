2017 gta v is fun and playing with other people online was fun but now now it seems like nothing but tedious work so much of the game content is locked away at the cost of in game money the game is not fun when the only thing to do is grind endless jobs for money of course you can skip the boring grind fest by buying shark cards with real world money but who wants to spend 100 on top of the 60 price tag just to get the good content in the past this could be solved with the aid of friendly modders who could rain money from the sky a litteral blessing from above but now at the hand of rockstar and their publisher take two modders are no more the game is a grind fest and all this for the sake of filthy greed screw these guys
