pros not grindy unless you want to min max otherwise i made it to level 50 solo without needing to grind resources or mods just follow the progression and do the side quests and you ll be fine until you get to endgame i ll get to that in a sec also this is only for the first novice scenario manibus i have no idea what the next seasons or scenarios will be like since i m not there yet can play solo like i said i completed all the main and side quests in manibus completely solo which is nice but can t comment on future seasons base building best part about the game imo despite it being janky af just try not to lose your sanity attempting to connect the pieces where you want them to esp roof pieces beautiful environment crisp audio from gunshots to enemy sounds it s great i like it radio stations subjective but i like it so it s going on the list esp 107 2 fm nice and chill cons buggy ranges from ultra frustrating to progress breaking tho they have fixed some these issues but not nearly there yet performance issues inconsistent frame rates 100 cpu usage and pop ins that would make todd howard proud slow and unresponsive command inputs you gotta spam your f key if you wana pick up items plant crops open doors etc same with using items in your hotbar this can be troublesome if you need to heal quick in combat it s frustrating painfully generic story poor dialogue and forgettable characters they clearly took inspiration from games like death stranding and control but only the aesthetics and none of the substance braindead ai i know the bar for enemy ai is really low these days but somehow once human managed to go even lower took out an entire camp while all the hostiles are busy attacking a squirrel completely ignoring me mag dumping on their faces you can shoot an unsuppressed rifle a few meters directly in front of a group of enemies and they won t care you can kill one of them and the others will simply just walk to where their buddy died and you ll be fighting the same dumb enemies over and over again they ll even respawn if you walk too far from their spot making clearing strongholds tedious bosses are meh figuring out their phases and weakspots is hilariously easy and the higher level ones are just more bullet spongey and hit harder copy paste buildings yes the environment is great but a lot of the structures are exactly the same inside and out cringe outfits and weapon skins if you like normal looking guns you re gonna have a bad time seriously why can t we have an option for normal skins for higher level guns even the enemies have normal looking guns so why can t we why can t i use the regular mps7 skin for the div evo or the kam pioneer skin for the crank or abyss glance some rosatta soldiers have black ars why put that in the game if players can t have it i want my black ar the textures are there just please for the love of god let us use it or at the very least let us be able to paint the guns black sub menus within sub menus within sub menus you unknowingly completed some challenge and are rewarded for it but you gotta first find it deep in the bowels of their sub menus to claim it good luck atrociously confusing incomplete and sometimes incorrect information on index get used to googling everything server wipes yeah yeah i know you can migrate a lot of your stuff and keep your blueprints and looting isn t difficult and there s eternaland blah blah blah i don t wanna deal with it if the gameplay loop was actually fun then it would have been fine but i can t be arsed to do all that again just to rebuild my memetics and level up plus this puts pressure on the player to log in and play making it difficult to enjoy the game on your own pace i see no reason why this should even be a thing for pve servers endgame after completing all main and side quests you ll have nothing left to do but build your base collect pokemons or grind to max out your gear how engaging the grind will be will vary per player but since i don t like the gameplay i found the endgame very boring dude that airplane deviant looks badass can t wait to fight it climbs the mountain to get to it climbs on its back it to begin event oh damn it s taking off we gonna fight in the air sick nope it s balloons you shoot balloons while riding around on its back then when it s over you just unceremoniously teleport to some random spot on the ground this disappointed me more than i ever could my own parents additional notes i work from home and usually just have the game running in the background while doing other things hence the high number of hours played most of that is me just afk while talking with a client or spent base building i don t consider being a free game as a pro because these free games with mobile gaming business strategies make more money than a more traditional type of paid game it s free but they will purposely lower the quality of the gaming experience in some way in order to pressure the player into paying for something that is usually overpriced like a piece of cosmetic that s worth a full game this practice is very anti consumer manipulative and the reason why a lot of games suck these days and once human is no different compared to other free games in this regard that being said there is some enjoyment to be had here and i m sure plenty of you will find that out for yourselves especially after they smoothen the rough edges and fix the bugs which i m fairly confident they will in time some of these cons like the one about cosmetics are completely personal and subjective i know a lot of you don t mind goofy looking skins and a good number of you really enjoy that if so then more power to you but for players like me that prefer a more serious aesthetic that imo works better with the game s dark atmosphere the budget pokemons wacky outfits and fortnite looking guns do the immersion a disservice cute and scary can work but it doesn t here the game also has pvp but i m not interested in it didn t touch it so i have no opinions about it so it s mostly not grindy but gameplay is also disappointing i would actually prefer if it was more grindy but with good combat take a game like warframe for example super grindy but i don t mind coz combat is badass conclusion it s free so try it out yourself i came in with very low expectations knowing it s a free to play mobile game ported to pc it got me hooked on the first few hours and it took some time before i discovered everything i hate about it but by then i had already invested too much time building a base i really like to stop playing from then on it gave just the very bare minimum for me to log in and play some more but it s no longer enjoyable will most likely stop playing in a week or two or if something better comes out or if one of my wishlist items goes on sale if you re looking for something free to sink a few hours in then have at it but if you re in search of a new main game to invest hundreds of hours into then keep in mind that the disappointment might not hit you right away you might or might not have a similar experience but for me considering the bugs pathetic combat awful cosmetics and poor endgame experience it s gonna be a no update while playing i was randomly logged out then the game crashed annoying but nothing out of the ordinary relaunching the game took a lot longer than usual but when i finally made it to the main menu i realized my character had been erased great repair client option doesn t work apparently this has happened to quite a few players too i just restarted the game a few times and finally found my server and character was back amazing
