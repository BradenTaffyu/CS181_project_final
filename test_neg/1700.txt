i didn t realize how much dlc the game has i was interested in the total war series because the warhammer lore is insanely lit so i just said it and purchased the newest game you legit can play maybe 10 of the factions on top of that the 1st two iterations of total war are both much older and are still both 60 and are required for the factions that released with those games how is anyone supposed to get into this game when they didn t start playing since its inception absolutely the most cringe thing i have ever seen when it comes to entering a new franchise not only do you have to have the two previous total war games but you have to have the 10 000 dlc s that accompany those as well if i wanted to just buy all of the content and play the game for the 1st time it would be like 1 000 wtf is the thought process there i get a company trying to make money but how the do you expect anyone to enjoy it when 90 of the game is locked behind massive paywalls i love the series and watch a lot of youtube content on total war it is sad to see that this is the reality of a game that has so much to offer it should be illegal what they are doing edit i will say that i do enjoy the game and it is realy fun people saying u can buy the dlc s on other sites etc yeah i see that you can after researching it but how is that supposed to be common knowledge to new players the game is cool but the marketing is gg
