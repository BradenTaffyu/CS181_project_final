2023 first off the game is great in fact it s amazing everyone knows that i can t recommend this game though because of the awful social club and equally awful rockstar games services drm b s you have to deal with played this game fine a few years ago i go back to play it and it turns out the email i used to set up social club is one i no longer have access to therefore i can t login and can t play the game period i ve been in contact with rockstar support for a week and still haven t resolved the issue i ve gone back and forth with them five or six times and every time they want some other proof i bought the damn game i ve sent them four or five screenshots of receipts steam id bla bla bla and it s never enough it s ridiculous now even though i have a current social club account with an email i can actually access they need a third email to use to update my account wtf forget it i m sick of it i even bought a physical copy off of ebay to try and get around this issue no go physical copy makes no difference unless i continue to jump through their hoops i will never be able to play gtav again on pc seriously you guys made tons of money off this game what s the deal with the draconian drm i m old enough to remember when you bought a game on pc it came in a nice box with a nice manual and maybe even some bonus items with an actual cd or gasp floppy disk that contained the entire game and it was yours to keep and play forever now for your money you get a digital copy that s drm protected to a ridiculous degree that you can t play if you want to try and change something as simple as your email crap like this is why gaming just isn t as fun as it used to be those days are gone greed has completely taken over the industry when it comes to aaa games such as this loved the gta series up until this point but this is so stupid guys i m out on gta6 not that it makes any damn difference
