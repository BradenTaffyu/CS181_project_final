2018 i ve put literally hundreds of dollars into this game by buying it all the season passes all the elite skins and more and it s my most played game by 200 hours without ever getting into trouble that i can remember i just played again for the first time in a while notably after the ridiculous new code of conduct rules for chat and was suspended for 30 minutes out of nowhere for toxic behaviour nothing i said came even close to breaking the code of conduct that i can tell but when reaching out to ubisoft support to find out what exactly i did to get this suspension i was told that i cannot be told the specifics of my sanction despite ubisoft staff publicly bringing up details of people s sanctions on reddit before when it s suitable for a pwnage moment one of my favourite games and one of the few ubisoft hadn t ruined because they actually listened to the community don t plan on giving you any more of my money or support going forward because of the ridiculous anti community policies that have been put in place because of complaints by a minority of clients who want to turn a game into a safe space no longer recommending this game to anyone anymore you no longer deserve the support
