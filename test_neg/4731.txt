2022 this game was fun for all about 1 day the sbmm just absolutely ruins it for me i work 9 hours a day and i would like to just relax and enjoy the game but god forbid i get 1 10 kd and i m off into the lobby of tryhard 13 year olds who havnt showered since release i am really tired of this garbage that comes out i cant even play this game with my girlfriend had she been in my lobbies she cant even play just an unfun experience really not every game needs to be extremely tryhard i miss being able to play the game with good players and bad players also there is way too many cheesy builds to run already seeing at least 1 shield knife runner every other game for 70 and only mp to play with a 5 hour campaign this game is not worth that much
