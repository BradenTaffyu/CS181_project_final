2018 the above 15 hours is inaccurate to the actual amount of playtime i have in this game i am currently at prestige master level 106 in multiplayer and prestige 5 in zombies i d say ive had enough time invested to give a decent review campaign by now everyone knows that this game is infamous for having a bad campaign which is true in a way personally my enjoyment was haltered due to the lack of a connection to the previos two installations with only a slight nod that sets up the timeline there are no beloved characters and as far as i know no descendants the story features a fresh batch of bland characters alongside a story that may be enjoyable to new players but is a diservice to fans the gameplay is decent but not great but does feel like a typical call of duty game multiplayer as i previously stated i have a very long time invested into the multiplayer of this game this is not because i found the game great but rather centered around me grinding for the famed dark matter camo along with hero armor for my specialist characters and showing off my accomplishments in lobbies of children that posed no real combatative challenge in short i played because i wanted the cool stuff and the lobbies tend to be easy to dominate in this games multiplayer like its campaign really revolve around personal preferance gameplay is clunkier than other cleaner infinity ward games there is a decent majority of gamemodes almost all unplayable at this point in time beacause the community only plays team death match you will be lucky to find a game of domination any other gamemode you will be starting a lobby alone the guns in this game are a major turn off the game features generic futurastic weapons of which the only varierty you seem to encounter is smgs and shotguns both of these groups contain very powerful weapons that are used by the majoirty of the community this is also the game that really enforced the supply drop system set in to place by advanced warfare there are countless weapon camos uniforms reticles calling cards emblems and otther items that amke it impossible to access the desired pay to win dlc weapons did i forget to mention that you also recieve duplicates of these thousands of useless and sometimes ugly items killstreaks and perks are nothing impressive although raps are a fun addition most perks that are not typically in other call of duty titles are unforgetable and almost useless the movement system in this game is also a large complaint heard about the title although not personally a fan of the wallrunning and exo movements black ops 3 perfected this movement system and made it as enjoyable as possible in the multiplayer zombies this is the true draw of this game treyarch is known for having the best zombies experience of any call of duty team and it truly shows here the base map along with most of the dlc maps season pass and chronicles are spectacular maps and are truly worth the purchase zombies has truly never been better in this title and it only gets better with the support of mods in this game from 100s of new custom maps to access to mod menus the zombies mode offers an unbelievable amount of content that will more than satisfy any fan of call of duty zombies conclusion black ops 3 contains a lackluster campaign and a multiplayer that s well ok at best for longtime call of duty fans looking for a classic style multiplayer cinematic campaign smooth gameplay or even a serious war game this is most definitely not for you if you are a new player are attracted to the futuristic theme or are a fan of zombies then totally check the game out if you are still mixed wait for a sale this game is still overpriced and if you cannot find enough content to satisfy you then i would avoid this game until it is on sale campaign badmultiplayer okzombies awesome
