2016 as cliche and lame as it may sound it is with a heavy heart that i have to say i do not recommend this game as much as i d like to the community is toxic the developers seem to be largely incompetent as every patch they release further breaks the game both mechanically and balance wise the survivors have become overpowered and the killer will have a very frustrating time killing all of them yes you can kill up to two survivors and still rank up but the amount of frustrating work you re expected to do to accomplish this is far from fun and satisfying and is more of a chore most survivors abuse infinites and exploits and swarm the hook once a person has been thrown on and then when you try to keep your survivor on the hook you re called a camper if you fail to catch all of them you re teabagged and laughed at when i first got this game i mostly played killer my pc was having issues and the lag on killer was more manageable once my pc was fixed i went over to survivor for awhile and made it to rank 9 before the ranking season reset in the past week before writing this i ventured back over to the side of the killer at first it was fun and i was having reasonable games sometimes i got all of the survivors sometimes i only got 1 or two but everyone played fairly and all was fine but once i hit rank 15 it all went downhill survivors started abusing infinites they started teabagging they started swarming the hook every time i put someone on they would be abuse infinites and then accuse me of hook camping in the after game chat clearly the survivors have no fear of the killer and the gameplay for them has suffered drastically the developers do not care about that however they have stated that their statistics show that the killer is winning rounds just as well as ever that may be the case but those statistics say nothing about how the experience was for the player you can still reasonably win but the experience you will have will be fraught with frustration and trolling for me presently the only saving grace for me is that i have enough friends to play private matches where i can play with people who i can trust to play without abusing exploits or teabagging or any of the garbage that you experience in online games but that s hardly worth the twenty dollars for this game the experience for the killer needs to change i am not saying they need to be buffed but something needs to change because right now the killer side of the game is way to frustrating to be enjoyable and the game depends on the killers needs the killers they are essentially the main focus of the game it is a 4v1 horror game the killer needs to be overpowered to a degree for this game to work i hate to be that guy but friday the 13th is coming out soon and this game will have serious competition regardless of your thoughts of the game it will be competition i predict a fair amount of players will migrate to that game and when that happens the developers will have to make a decision the killers need to be the focus of the game not the survivors the survivors are supposed to be lambs trying to escape the slaughter the game needs to feel like that not like a broken game of hide and seek
