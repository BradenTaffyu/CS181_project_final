2017 take two and rockstar really digged their own grave with this action i never modded gta 5 cuz i feared my online progress would all be for nothing though i did use open iv often to mod gta iv which was ofcourse a lot of fun to make it clear i don t dislike the game that much but this drastic and completely useless action from take two and rockstar proves that they flipped us all off and i don t even wanna start on about how many machinima creators now have to cancel their work because of this crap ps i suggest they rename this game to unmoddable loading simulator 2017 the screw you edition
