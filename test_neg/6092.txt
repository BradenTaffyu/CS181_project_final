2017 instead of telling you all the pros and cons of dead by daylight i ll first make a list of all the bugs glitches and other flaws that still happen to me and my friends regularly over 6 month after the game was fully released the game freezes or crashes while searching for a game entering a game or playing a game it often takes literal hours to get into a lobby matchmaking is terrible you as middle rank survivor can end up with three low rank survs against a rank 1 killer or you play against 4 rank 1 survs as rank 20 lowest possible rank killer there are no limits for this idiocy there is a feature to play survive with friends together with your steamfriends however you often end up alone in the public lobby while you friends get disconnected if you actually made it into a game you might be the only survivor left it can happen that your teammates get disconnected during the loading screen especially when the killer has a bad internet connection the game works with a so called p2p connection that means that it depends on the lobby host the killer if there is lag or not of course there is lag in many games no it s not my connection the lag doesn t only affect your movement but also the skill checks the indicator will tremble which makes it really hard to succeed the skill check skill checks often pop up after you went away from the generator but then you can t even do them successfully anymore there are skill checks that can t physically be done successfully when the skill check area is in the first third of the circle you only have 0 3 seconds time to react the shortest reaction time of a human is between 0 2 and 0 3 seconds this is the time your brain needs to realize what s happening then add a few tenth of seconds for your muscular response clicking space and boom skill check failed one killer the nurse can hit you even if he doesn t aim at you there is an autoaim mechanic that basically let s her hit survivors automatically if she roughly aims in their direction the worst abomination of that mechanic is when you run past the killer quickly but the killer hits you anyways at an 180 angle the killer s hit range is under special circumstances ridiculously high there is a perk that allows you to run faster for a short period of time sprint burst if it activates while the killer starts performing a hit you will run away from him but get hit anyway at distances of over five meters my high score was when a nurse got me even though i was already so far away that the heartbeat rate went down one of the killers has a chainsaw that kann down you immediately this chainsaw can saw around corners through walls and at rare occasions even at an 180 angle it s magic some perks don t always or hardly ever work decisive strike premonition selfheal crows from the shadows if decisive strike does work you can end up stuck in the ground unable to move in some occasions the normal sprinting doesn t work after you ve been hit you sometimes get locked in the crouching position until you get hit by the killer pallet vault doesn t always work especially when the killer is standing in the space where the pallet should drop this is extra awesome since there is a game mechanic that should allow you to rescue a survivor that is carried on the killer s shoulder by stunning him when you drop a pallet it happens many times that the game suddenly teleports you to the side of the pallet you were coming from directly into the killer s arms while being carried by the killer you should be able to wiggle free but the wiggle bar doesn t always show up same goes for the recover bar when two interact able objects are close together e g a closet and a window and you press space to get through it you might get sucked sideways into or through the other object the button layout generally needs improvement since too many actions are on the same buttons from time to time you get stuck in stones or in between trees the progress bar doesn t display exactly how far you have progressed it fails in its entire existence the exit gate doesn t open the generator doesn t finish the survivor doesn t unhook and the hook doesn t get destroyed when the bar is already entirely full this means that the killer can still grab you when you already should have finished when you get grabbed by the killer he can hang you on a hook then another survivor has to unhook you however you might die randomly before they even get the chance to rescue you you can also die while being unhooked before the time runs out or unhook generally doesn t work and you are doomed one of the killers can lay bear traps if one of them is close to a hook but not directly under it you can get sucked into the trap while unhooking in certain locations the traps sink into the ground and become invisible the survivor and killer models are solid objects you can t just run through them usually but there is also a glitch were you can players can use this to block others in narrow passages and killers can prevent survs from unhooking by just standing in front of the hook body blocking to prevent players from hiding afk in a closet the devs have added crows that will fly above a still standing survivor after a while to give out their position the problem is the crows come way too early if a killer searches the area where you are more thoroughly than usually you can t move that much the crows will appear and basically get you killed as killer grabbing survivors while they unhook or escape through the hatch sometimes doesn t work you don t always get your bloodpoints and pips after a game there are a maximum of three daily rituals challenges where you get bonus points at a time usually you should be able to replace unfinished ones with a new one every day it often doesn t work for days a friend of mine lost all his items addons and offerings that were on the second pages of the loadout screen and last but not least there is a bug that resets your entire game progress and you can t do anything about it thus if you have really bad luck you lose hundreds of hours of playtime well that just have been the bugs there are more reasons to not buy dead by daylight the devs randomly ban people without specifying any reason to stop people from using infinites running circles through badly placed obstacles so that the killer can t catch you they boarded up most of the windows in the houses as a result you now often run into a dead end and end up dead in addition if you jump through a window three times in a short period of time they get blocked by some magic fence the stupidity of the pallet placement is hard to comprehend there are pallets right between to two trees guess what that doesn t stop the killer since he can walk around trees shocking isn t it the ranking system is weird you get points for getting chased but not for staying hidden and thus alive you can escape and still lose a rank pip there are also games where the killer doesn t murder a single survivor and still gets twice the points he needs to rank up get a pip the game allows players to destroy the fun of all other players i m talking about camping body blocking and infinites i know this sadly had become normal in online games but that doesn t stop me from pointing it out the developers rather focus on pay2 win or overpriced cloathing dlcs instead of finally fixing all these bugs don t get me wrong dbd can be fun at the beginning especially with friends but you ll often end up upset after playing and the fun you had can t eradicate your anger don t do this to you it s not worth it
