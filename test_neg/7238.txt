little refresher and update on my previous review after a decent amount of hours i ve realized game becomes way too easy when you get into battahl once you get the gear from new vendors it s over not to mention the absolutely broken magic archer class the only way to make it interesting is with mods by increasing enemy hp i enjoyed overall aesthetic presentation level design and visuals as a whole looks bit outdated but comes together pretty well as entire picture as of writing this dlss still looks awful washed out and blurry runs like absolute dog water even with a 4090 fg audio music combat sfx and voice acting are good nothing to complain about great combat since it s basically re skinned fantasy mh with and it s a good thing pawn system is absolutely excellent and unique feature that makes dd2 stand out among other rpgs overall narrative story and dialogue are boring but has some decent quests and creative puzzles realistically 2 3 into the games excitement will fizzle out and it becomes repetitive and easy personally get it on sale if you re not sure with a discount this will be worth it if you re on the fence
