2020 tl drthis review has taken on a life of its own so simply allow me to say that gta 5 story mode is expensive given how old it is but quite good however calling gta online trash would be an insult to trash the community is toxic it s poorly balanced and there seem to be as many cheaters called modders in gta yeah sure let s call it a community griefers as proper players gta 5 on story mode 5 years after release is pretty expensive but excellent however gta online is a swirling vortex of toxicity and excrement the amount of cheaters and griefers is astounding i have never seen the like in any game in fact i only have about 20 hours under my belt at the time of writing and i have already reported about 10 players for actively griefing flying around killing with missiles waiting for you to respawn rinse and repeat that seems very common or cheating being unkillable i got the unnatural selection achievement because one player couldn t be killed and killed all npcs on screen the rest of us just stood by and or died and killing every player in the session seems common the latter i just had 3 players do within 5 10 minutes of each other in the same session of 29 players ironically the cooldown on reporting players means that it wasn t possible to do before they had switched sessions to make gaming miserable for someone else gta focuses heavily on multiplayer so the vast majority of missions heists and basically everything that s interesting is multiplayer that can be great but for the most part if you aren t playing with friends it probably won t be you will usually either play with someone who seems incredibly overpowered due to gear and they ll just take care of everything while you wait or you ll get someone who is at a similar stage to yourself but somehow seems to always have a terrible understanding of the game i would say that if you have plenty of money then gta 5 story mode is worthwhile but don t waste your time on gta online it is horrible not because of the game although once you have played story mode the only pull in my view is playing with friends it s the toxic players and that no exploit seems to have been fixed at any point and the most toxic players also seem to be the people benefitting rockstar games indifference towards exploitation funny thing while i wrote this review there was another cheater who seemed to put everyone in cages certainly put me in one and then killed everybody once people started leaving the session he managed to kill everybody twice before i had time to leave the session update i can see i gave gta online a full 30 hours more since i wrote that review despite the repetitiveness of the quests to keep your factories going but that time has been spent mostly loading to be fair it s a massive world loading taking a while should be expected however i have been constantly loading because i have to leave the sessions prematurelyh due to the amount of bored griefing cheaters combined just in the last 15 20 hours or so i have been killed more than 70 times by 5 players those are just the biggest griefer i have encountered during that time all of whom where either unkillable or damn near it we re taking multiple rpgs to them nothing happening or very little losing about 10 percent health by getting an rpg to the chest the cooldown on reporting meant i had to let them keep killing me even when i ghosted their organizations they found ways to grief me out of the game giving me max wanted level and destroying every vehicle i attempted to use so i couldn t get away not that reporting does the slightest but i won t let r claim that they can t do anything about it if the players don t report it or something to that effect anyway game uninstalled amd i ll be seeking a refund cause this is the worst mmorpg experience i have had toxic gameplay and chat poorly balanced a bit repetitive expansions to the world doesn t seem to have been well planned out and worst of all an incredible amount of cheaters and griefers not necessarily two in one but was often the case sorry my response was too long for the comment section so i ll just leave it here crispychickenwings1stly ignoring trolls or generally people who decide to come with unconstructive and or inane comments is in my view counterproductive if i didn t rebuke xxxanatos comment it would implicitly validate both their opinion and the manner in which they expressed it indicating that it was well reasoned and or acceptable which i don t believe it was in this case therefore i rebuked them and i believe my comment at the very least was no more rude than the one i had received from xxxanatos you do realize that you can fly around and shoot missiles without cheating right i do which is why i used it to exemplify a common tactic that griefers use to surprise ruin the gaming experience for others as i already stated in my review base your review on the actual game and not your experiences i m just one big question mark with that statement while writing that sentence you should at some point have realized it makes no sense when talking about a multiplayer game i would argue that when reviewing anything unless it s overly technical like a cpu people tend to review the complete experience not just the technical aspects simply because it doesn t matter if gta were the best game ever created cause it is completely ruined by the players and how poorly rockstar games manage those players you can t give a detailed review with like 30 hours in the game how many of that is story mode since you insist although i hardly see the relevance you may also have notice that i stated that story mode is excellent so i provided both a review of the actual game and the elements that ruined it and i know story mode is excellent cause i completed in on console years ago i wanted to give gta online a shot i played about 60 hours before quitting gta and about 55 of those were in gta online you can do much more in a private online session or a session with chill people i had aircrafts helo offices warehouses 3 businesses a boat and i m guessing around 10 cars i ddn t have any yachts or an oppressor and i have no idea of how much of time was spent in sessions with chill people but i have done a few heists all unsuccesful and using the watered down private sessions specifically to avoid other players kind of defies the point of a multiplayer platform doesn t it it s like avoiding crashing your car by never driving it hopefully chill people were in every sessions and it was just 1 5 cheaters griefers that ruined the experience for one two or all the other players rather than every other player who wanted to ruin the gaming experiences of others while you seem to believe that the amount of time i have wasted being griefed out of gta online should somehow invalidate what i m saying which seems kind of ridiculous to me i would argue that the important part is that i played gta online for only around 60 hours and i spent what felt like the majority of that time switching sessions because of the constant griefers and cheaters you should be asking yourself how in just 60 hours my gta online gaming experience could be this bad i mean just the amount of different situations and types of cheats griefs i have described must indicate to you that i have experienced quite a bit of cheating griefing and i have experienced it all in less than 60 hours you shouldn t be trying to invalidate my review because i haven t played suffered for long enough you should be asking yourself what the hell is wrong with gta online since anyone could have that many as you said experiences in less than 60 hours sidenote yes i m indeed regretting enabling comments
