2022 way to go fromstoftware the anti cheat and the fps drops adds to the overall feel and atmosphere of the game i definitely feel tarnished now yay i buy the game and get the shoplifter treatment when will these devs learn update the problems still persist with this so called pc port lag fps drops graphic options that can t be turned off onwhat a disappointment and fans cult are still defending this kind of behavior this is a game a pc port to be specific it s 2022 and still their standards are 60fps which by the way they are far from it with this stutter mess stay away from this garbage one more thing i can sum up this game as dark souls movement sekiro bosses fun imagine facing the owl without being able to guard 10 10
