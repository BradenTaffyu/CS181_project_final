2019 at this point this game is not worth buying anymore it just got out of hands at first it was a jumping car then a flying cars and then they added the most op bike in the game that flies and has lock on rockets nobody even does heists anymore so you have to wait around 10min to get the lobby for 1 mission and fail it 20 times and then wait 20min to do the next setup for the heist ps not to mention all the hackers that are going around blowing you up or crashing your game
