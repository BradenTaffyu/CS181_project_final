2022 this game was published months to early as of now the problem is this is not a finished game and it was planned exactly like that that would have been okay as you get a little content to allow you to play until the actual campaign comes what makes it problematic is that the content we actually get is utterly dull repetitive and already needed a big fix patch for many problems in fact the problems are so big ca postponed the content this game so desperately needs to create solutions on the foundation a good step of course but too late now that the game is published for full price no less people want to play and despite you get more factions than ever to start with you barely have anything to do with them ca should have postponed the game as a whole to care for all the problems this game has that way our expections would still be when will the game be published instead of when will we get the needed content it s a problem with expectations too high the grand finale and game pushed out too carelessly it s not a bad game if we get the content it is planned to be published with no it would be a damn awesome game that s what this shows but it is a demonstration version for a full price for what s yet to come this is not a full game don t treat it as such add the game got better due to some patches it s still not a great game it does what a total war game does other total war games are better this is still not the game it could be and that the developer thinks it is see the abnormal prices for dlcs add fans are angry about the pricing policy 25 for a simple lord pack with three lords and nof much else in shadows of change for example and how does creative asdembly react they announced they will delete discussions about prices and possibly ban people from their communities fine as a reviewer though i feel i gotta tell you about that talking about prices should be allowed for customers bad move wouldn t recommend to buy a game with such pricing and community policy
