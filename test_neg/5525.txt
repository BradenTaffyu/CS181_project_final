2022 if the game were to be released how it is today i think it would be a major success however after seeing how the game has progressed over the past 7 years its hard to appreciate this version seeing the dev team trying to relate to the playerbase has been utterly embarrassing also not a fan of politics or real world debated issues in video games and this dev team has started implementing that literally nobody cares thats not what this game is about the new ui compared to the old is horrendous cheating is still as prevalent as ever possibly worse it took over 3 years for a new map since then theyve been releasing 1 operator every season as opposed to 2 and have some very questionable gadgets that look straight ripped from games like valorant the game siege that was supposed to be realistic to real world technology has far left that in the past with operators like sens azami iana and melusi im also all for diversity in video games but compare the first operators in this game to the current ones and you can see where the devs mind is at it just adds the unrealisticness i used to watch a lot of r6 content creators since this game came out and all of them have quit except for a few because of how low the engagement is every healthy game out there has a strong viewerbase to it the only thing doing well is the esports section and even that has fallen off player counts are surprisingly high but i wouldn t be surprised if half of them were secondary accounts for cheating for the actual game itself it requires a massive amount of time to be put into it in order for you to start getting value in games map knowledge operator knowledge and practical mechanic sense is all just as important as actual aim expect to be utter trash until after putting in like 25 hours then you can enjoy the game conclusion id recommend this game for only new players who want to suffer sure it s different and unique but just know it had much greater potential to it gamebreaking bugs and poor dev decisions forced a large number of players to leave in the past so dont be surprised when it happens again
