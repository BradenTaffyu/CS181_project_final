2021 i love this game to death it has one of the best gameplay loops i can think of and is nearly the perfect br for me which is why it sucks having to write this review the staggering amount of eastern players on us eu servers is frankly unacceptable you can go from a 30kill game to a game where you can t even react because the enemy is desyncing so much it makes a mobile seizure look like a stock image you never see them get banned but they flood the leaderboard and every match you re only hope at a good game is doing quick match and praying the chinese players with vpns are only looking to mmr climb in ranked blood bath is usually extremely fun as there is no competitive scene behind it so you re 99 of the time playing with players with a decent ping when losing against players who are simply better than you it is still fun and satisfying you can think back and go oh i should have done this or if i would have countered here i could have turned that around losing in such a manner almost never makes you rage losing against a player dysyncing who is pulling off combos then teleporting behind you or somehow countering you 3 5 seconds after you ve swung does not feel good it can completely destroy an a good time and will genuinely make you drop the game for the night or entirely until a strict stance is taken against vpn and desyncing players i refuse to spend another cent on this game and will advice others to stay away
