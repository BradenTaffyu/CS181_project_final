this is going to be a revised and re written review of the game following my third playthrough ng of my 2nd character around 300 hours of in game play time i think i m finally ready to put the game down until we get dlc which i think the game will very badly need to have the relevance a sequel like this should ve had i still would not recommend it until then the good the combat of the game really is exceptional it is very similar to dd1 nearly the same in core design really but executed in such a satisfying way the added weight and energy given to attacks and movement plays a big part in that it helps to further ground the game in a sort of fantastical realism that the first game didn t quite have since it was comparatively fast and floaty at times the world design is phenomenal in my opinion its really impressive to me that they got a map this big and detailed and populated to be a seamless open world it has its drawbacks namely performance but as a technical feat its crazy what they have done for a capcom game there s very little if anything that feels like an oversight or afterthought the game as a whole just looks fantastic great design great direction great environments and great atmosphere enemies look wonderful griffons and dullahans stick out to me as exceptional griffons for how stunning they look and dullahans for just how hectic and dangerous they are as a humanoid enemy i will agree with others that there is a lack of enemy variety but it personally never bothered me much because combat is still so different from encounter to encounter enemy placement enemy composition enemy tactics and the terrain you fight in play a big part in how you will approach each situation it keeps the gameplay very fresh and fun well beyond what i would expect for a game with a limited bestiary these points make up probably 80 of your time with the game and it is good that they did them all so well it made it so that my time with the game was largely enjoyable the whole way through and i could recommend the game on those points alone if you can overlook all the other issues i will be laying out ahead the mixedas great as the combat feels in this game there is simply less choice and less to do than in dd1 all the classes lost at least a few abilities spells the physical combat classes fighter warrior thief and archer all are great some class skills got made into core skills so the transition from 6 skills to 4 really didn t hurt them much would ve been nice to see the return or implementation of combo based inputs to further expand their core skillset but i wouldn t say it feels lacking without them mages and sorcerers lost almost all their indirect defensive offensive skills i cannot understate how comparatively butchered they are in this version of the game are they still useful yes but between the move from 6 to 4 spell slots and the removal of different boons buffs and debilitations they are far less flexible mages are relegated to a hard support role with almost no direct offensive capabilities no 2nd tier of offensive skills like comestion or brontide no poison and no torpor torpor admittedly was busted sorcerers got some good spells but lost a lot of other good spells as well they re great at applying debilitations in this game which are very strong but it feels more like a sidegrade than an upgrade to the walking magical nuke they were in dd1 strangely only bolide now meteorn and maelstrom returned from the first game as an avid sorcerer lover in dd1 to me it just leaves sorcerer in an odd place to me where you either use their normal lower tier spells which dont hit that hard and are great at applying status effects or you instantly blow up every enemy with meteorn through brute force alone really feast or famine in my eyes in terms of class fantasy the removal of spell free aiming also hurts maelstrom i wish mystic spearhand had some elemental damage skills its an alright class but it has a lot of built in drawbacks that only kindof justify their strength very lacking in good offensive skills a third of their skills feel gimmicky and or bad i will not entertain mirror shield apologists the class is not strong just because it has a broken defensive skill i wish we could cook fish at campfires too instead of just beast steaks items and crafting in general are under utilized weapon selection is not as good as it could ve been in my opinion especially knowing dd1 had a similar issue wish we had more good enchanted weapons for each class a lot of npcs have capes we cannot have give us their capes get rid of the dragonforged visual it looks bad i wish there were more randomized boss encounters they re the most fun part of the game to me but they dont let them appear out of their spawn areas enough the badthe main story isn t great starts okay in vernworth but very quickly loses any rhyme or reason once you reach battahl if you spend longer than 5 minutes thinking about any individual facet of the story and the characters therein you will probably find some issue for a game that advertised 60 hours to complete i quite frankly see that as a failure don t know what they were thinking when writing it and sadly i dont think it can be fixed with updates or dlcs the themes of the story retread on a lot of the themes from the first game but do it worse and also make less sense and explain less if you are the kind of person that wants to be engrossed by the world and get attached to characters the game does a pretty bad job of doing that and thats after 3 playthroughs really just a flop all around side quests aren t much better there are at least some interesting ones but nowhere close to anything worth writing home about a lot of running from person to person and place to place or passing time waiting on events not even many quests you can fail the objective of outside of advancing the main story or outright killing the quest npc just feels like the team somehow hasn t learned anything from the past decade of rpg games that preceded it characters themselves are overall less memorable than they were in dd1 in my opinion they added so many more of them and they individually just have less going on there are a few i actually did come to like and ones that i would say had good or compelling stories but even other major characters do nothing to draw you in the romance system is so archaic and wasted in this game even how its tied into the story is less impactful and clumsier than in dd1 the fact i can romance disa let alone be let in the same room as her causes such narrative dissonance in my head that i find it boggling really its just used as a way to get discounts at shops thats all its good for loot distribution in the game is dire almost everything you use you will buy in a shop the world is so fun to explore and see but they reward you for it so badly best loot you could really hope for in an area is finding some seekers tokens would very much recommend the wild loot mod its not perfect but its a massive improvement to the actual adventuring and looting aspect of the game we need some harder difficulties asap dont know how an itsuno game has come out in 2024 that has no official hard mode and no sort of replayable challenge to push the character you spend dozens of hours building up the game is an incredible foundation for more to come but with how long its been since dd1 it shouldn t have needed to be just a foundation personally i think it could use either an iceborne tier expansion to make it whole or more than one bbi sized dlc there is so much good in this game that they just didn t do enough with until some serious content additions come out or big updates happen i cant recommend the game it does not feel complete great action game terrible rpg
