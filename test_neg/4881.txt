2022 i am not going to lie and say that the game is no fun at all that s not true for me it is somewhat inevitable i always get cod every year but for those of you who wait and see i recommend you pass this one it is really disappointing negative points 1 calling cards basically hidden they exist and you can set them up on a profile page but unless someone specifically goes to examine you they don t see them they don t come up on the multiplayer screen anymore so what is the point of getting them anymore it was always a motivator to do cheevos and also interesting to see which ones other people had 2 terrible music and sound this is a big one to me and so important to making the games addictive the casino slot machine like sounds of past mw games is missing and so makes it feel very meh no adrenaline rush at all 3 game is poorly balanced though to be fair most cod games are when they release and that usually gets fixed4 game interface menus are horrendously bad and thus frustrating to use 5 what new things does the game offer to compensate for this absolutely nothing the whole game is just less than mw1 the single player campaign is pretty good though updates after more gameplay 6 weeks in and still constant crashes and fps drops after numerous patches and driver updatesmore updates 7 if you get disconnected from the multiplayer server it forces you to exit to desktop you cannot attempt to reconnect i m dead serious 8 we are now three months in while crashing had previously cased for about three of four weeks it has now been reintroduced with the latest patch at least once per hour without any error message
