when i first started playing this game it was fun the concept was interesting the gameplay was decent the bugs were few and the lag was very rare 1 as time went on i noticed one problem after another i ran into issues with limitations on things like my specialization my spec options were limited and the ability to respec did not change the options available to me but someone told me that once i hit 50 this would change and more spec options would be available when respeccing so i waited and leveled i also ran into issues of item storage in my base a problem that still is not addressed aside from just don t hold onto resources but when the game has proven that there is a bug that causes bases to disappear you must expect us to try to hold all the resources we can once i hit 50 none of these solutions were present respeccing still showed the same previous rng options that were there before so my spec is not my own it is what is available to me so why even have us spec into anything just assign us what you want us to have and stop trying to lie to us as though we have a choice 2 moving past that i accepted that i will need to rely on the people i play with so i began a hive and a warband and prior to today we would do events together every day we would run silos on hard mode then do prime wars on hard mode unless someone new needed the hard pass on our server and we would help them then we would do public events until the 4 hour reload timer for silo loot came around and do another silo tour on hard mode this was not only engaging for us as a community but allowed progression through hard work and persistence but the update today took away the ability to farm controllers in public events and now none of us want to do silos so we can save our controllers for pro modes when they unlock this change killed 2 3 of the things our entire server did together coordinated events server wide ruined by this stupid change 3 on top of this other people have issues with their farms we are unable to farm oil and acid at the same time now because this update took that from us this game has proven that it is less about the players having fun and more about the devs exerting control over the players progress we are not in control of our gameplay as a result some people are going to take a while to reach this realization but others will not either way eventually this controller nerf and the acid oil nerf and the rng specs will be the cause of death for this game it is only a matter of time
