2022 rockstar is very clearly doing nothing about the cheating that is running rampant in gta online despite constantly pushing various microtransactions it s so bad that the cheaters can crash your game kick you from a server remove your weapons and just generally ruin your experience the single player is just gta another one so nothing really to write home about there
