2022 this is a pretty long review i m gonna split it into three sets of twos two positives two neutrals and two negatives that said i don t think i can start a review on this game without saying that i love it to death there is a lot of fun to be had but there are a million asterisks to that statement so many ups and downs things to consider and red flags to be cautious of but without further adieu here s my take with almost 700 hours in the game licenses so many licenses dead by daylight is the biggest asymmetrical game on the market point blank period it s earned that title from years of constant active support from its developing company behaviour interactive commonly shortened to bhvr and an incredible number of horror ips that have joined the game there is straight up no other place to go that has the sheer number of licenses this game does featuring horror classics from halloween s michael myers texas chainsaw massacre s leatherface and half a dozen others you even have access to characters from beloved franchises silent hill and resident evil hell the most recent killer is albert f wesker himself and in between licensed killers like those bhvr cooks up another killer of the own every other chapter too based on everything from clowns to shady doctors to entities that are the embodiment of evil and a ton more too but having this many characters becomes a problem which we ll discuss when we reach the complaints section of this comment extremely active devs and a constant flow of content bhvr is always listening to its community even if it feels like that communication is lost in translation sometimes there are updates to the game every couple of weeks usually including new cosmetics and community bonuses and every three months comes the big chapter update involving a new killer and survivor s to play as new perks it s basically just a large content drop these are almost always paid dlc but they re usually not terribly expensive although buying all of them sure as hell is and often times are worth it if you enjoy a particular franchise except for a few infamous examples a community dividedsurvivors and killers are designed not to get along but that runs far far deeper than gameplay in some cases you get amazing people in the community who are absolute shining beacons and role models most players are happy to mind their own business and don t get too serious unless someone is actively trying to ruin their fun but some people in this community are the absolute worst thing the lowest of the low the dredges ha of society who will do anything to make themselves feel better even and especially at the cost of others enjoyment and even sanity it s one of the most mixed communities i have ever seen and i ve been playing games online since online gaming was a thing gameplay oh god gameplay i only have three words to put gameplay in this game into a nutshell random number generation the actual skill you have in the game only matters when the rng decides it should matter there will literally be times where you will outright lose a match because the game effectively decided the outcome with what map you re playing on and what objects spawn in that map and this goes both ways on balanced maps that get decently fair rng this game is absolutely wonderful and it requires you to actually outplay the other side using your wits above all else on unbalanced maps with bad rng this game is completely unplayable the disparity between these two situations is so incredibly wide that playing the same killer on shelter woods vs on fractured cowshed may as well be you playing two completely different games it s easily the most frustrating part of the game when it goes bad but thankfully it s good enough not to be unplayable every game except on cowshed cowshed balance this was what everyone who s played the game for a few hours was waiting for this game s balance is abysmal in a lot of regards maps are easily the biggest problem with balance again the difference between the best and worst maps for either side is unbelievable but perks and items don t help either playing against a team of solo players who aren t running strong meta loadouts will never be as difficult as running against a team of 4 super sweaty survivors who are all talking to each other on discord bringing the strongest perks the strongest items an offering to send you to a map that favors their team and on top of all that they have 10x your hours when you combine them all together balance in dead by daylight is a complete and utter joke as many of the memes will evidence pls nerf pig cheaters blatant and subtle this is a known issue but dbd is rife with cheaters as of late people with stolen or illegal accounts and illegal copies of dead by daylight who have no morals or code outside of winning the game by any means necessary bhvr has been working on a solution but easy anti cheat has proven itself to be worthless garbage over the last few years killers teleporting around the map and acting instantly to kill survivors in seconds survivors teleporting around the map instantly completing generators and escaping in under 3 seconds cheaters on both sides holding the game hostage by ruining everything for everyone it s absolutely atrocious you won t run into it often but when you do it s a real day ruiner and god help you if you re a mildly popular content creator at the end of the day i can t recommend dead by daylight it s like alcohol it s really bad for you and if you do it enough it ll probably kill you but once you start getting a taste for it you can t stop coming back to it a little bit here and there might be alright but you then have to ask if it s worth the cost of entry and right now i have to say that no it s not i love you dead by daylight but i can t do this anymore i m sure i ll be back next year i ll play for a month and then vanish again like i always do but that window gets shorter every time i return
