it s a good game if you have a pc that can run it stably if not try warhammer 2 but you need to bare in mind the state it released in after the poor release i stopped following it but after about 9 months to a year after release was when it finally became a product that can be considered finished enough to sell aside from that they milk you dry with the dlcs and a lot of factions that aren t dlc are diminished without them so it feels like they are taking advantage of you i buckled in the end and bought them all on sales and with keys to make it bearable which encourages them even more and it frustrates me but it s hard not to that s why despite having 77 hours and likely hundreds more hours to come it really frustrates me to the point i must give it a negative review in hopes that it impacts them and they reduce dlc prices and release their products in a closer to finished state with more reasonable pricing you might say that when comparing price to hours played it is worth it but total war games are just extremely long and shouldn t be rated like that if you weigh the effort they put into the dlc it will become clearer oh and the dlcs they release can be quite poor too in quality and quantity the most recent one has just got a new patch a few days ago which makes it barely worth it if you are comparing it to previous dlcs despite still being expensive
