2022 if you like chasing ships for literally hours on end or running away from ships because you are stacked with loot again for countless hours then this is the game for you there is no way to catch a ship once it is out of range unless they make ridiculous mistakes likewise there is no way to stop someone who is chasing you so its mostly a game of who will get bored and give up first usually these sorts of chases last for hours the failure imo is that the ship chasing has nothing to lose even if you sink them they just respawn on the same server with a fresh ship that already has enough supplies for a fight meanwhile the ship with loot running has nothing to gain if they sink the pursuer and everything to lose if they get sunk basically there is no balance of risk vs reward in these situations which are all to common in the game as far as i am concerned until this fundamental imbalance is addressed the game is pretty trash on top of that the game progression mainly centers around purchasing vanity items you can have a pretty sword but it doesn t do any more damage than an ugly one for example which wouldn t be so bad until you see that something as simple as buying a simple sail that is slightly shorter and therefore easier to see around cost over 8 200 000 gold something that would take the sweatiest gamer a couple weeks to accumulate and that s just for one single item if you like to unlock everything it would take multiple lifetimes of several hours a day game play to unlock it all to make it worse after purchasing the game initially they still lock many items behind cash only purchases personally i have no issue with game funded by microtransactions but i will never support microtransactions in a game i already had to pay for either the game is free to play with microtransaction or else you purchase the game and there are no microtransactions i refuse to do both
