2017 when i bought this game a couple of weeks ago and playing for a while as a nice guy character i couldn t imagine that gta online now is the stalinist russia simulator every action may be compromised even if it it s not prohibited it may be punished but at the same time some of the cheaters can play loose under the protection of modders and spoil community s life who are not protected but not guilty who are the real victims will stay in gulag of ban with real lawbreakers and the whole community would perceive them equally because they don t have an opportunity to know for what they ve been banned with no opportunity to appeal and after all of thise in a month i d have to play with permanent fear with no certainty that if i play fair i would not be punished the problem isn t real until it concerns you or your friends mention it please and it isn t sacrilege it s reality btw thank you rockstar you made near fascist regime in your small online world bravo
