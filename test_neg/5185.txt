2021 i ve enjoyed this game ever since alpha it was the perfect fit for competitive non toxic fun 5v5 attack defend gameplay that had me coming back every day just to meet new friendlies we even replayed against the same guys over and over again just because we had a good time then the toxic players started rolling in and ubi started monetizing the fact the player base started rising we got more and more cosmetics bordering the line of tom clancy realism we started seeing operators that could ve come from an overwatch drawing board we saw countless downgrades to lights textures animations effects you name it they downgraded it just because they thought adding cosmetics would keep the game alive now i have not played siege since year 2 season 3 until today and boy oh boy is the game far from what it once started as in an extremely bad way there is no heart or love when playing the game everyone is way too serious in casual the game looks like it has regressed in finesse and quality house is gone i seriously loved this game and i have over 600h combined on both uplay and steam i loved coming home booting siege up doing strat roulette and laughing together with the other team via chat it lost that the good times now it s just a husk of what once was and i m disheartened to see such a great game fall into the limbo that is extremely mediocre and catered to all other mainstream media kinda poetic if you think about it
