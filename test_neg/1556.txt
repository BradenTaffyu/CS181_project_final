2022 i love total war warhammer 2 and have played it for many hours nevertheless it has some well known weaknesses that bothered me a lot especially in the long run e g limited diplomacy little varied battles boring sieges with disadvantages for the defenders gate bug etc i ve put about 18h into the game so far starting a multiplayer and single player campaign with kislev completing the prologue and briefly starting a multiplayer campaign with cathay based on these experiences i ll evaluate the things i ve experienced so far i think it s worth noting that ca has taken player feedback to heart to address many of the issues from the previous two games and to make the game even bigger and more varied i really feel bad for the developers because i recognize a lot of very good intentions and efforts but in its current state the game is unplayable for me and unfortunately this includes many issues that probably can t be easily fixed but are very fundamentally rooted in the game s architecture i hope they didn t mess up with this as the game had a great potential so first the positive things that really improve the game experience for me diplomacy is not a complete revolution but it is much more transparent than before the menu navigation is not optimal especially regarding outposts etc but i think that s a matter of getting used to it i would also like additional transparency concerning the costs of diplomatic actions depending on the general relationship with the faction i like the artwork of the world map and of the new factions small highlights are the descriptions of certain points on the map which fills the whole thing with even more warhammer feeling and story the ui for the heroes and commanders is clearer and somewhat more user friendly especially for followers i also love that this has been expanded further and there are now item sets and you can recycle items for gold or to create new items i had always missed that before the simultaneous turns in multiplayer allow for a completely new gameplay experience this is really great the fact that you can let others control parts of your army is really cool as is the ability to hire allied factions in armies and outposts neutral i didn t experience any major issues with performance on my rather old pc i can only play it on medium settings high to ultra settings in its predecessor but it runs smoothly here for the most part i can t currently evaluate the campaign mechanics as i haven t progressed far enough for that the chaos portals however are currently a bit annoying it also feels like there is always a lot of time pressure right from the start and now for the weaknesses by far the biggest problem for me are the minor settlement battles i was really looking forward to this since there was a lack of variety in the predecessor but ca missed the target the maps are huge and look great but currently they are unplayable there are so many bottlenecks and narrow alleys that units can t be positioned there are always blobs that completely block each other any kind of formation is impossible ranged units can barely be positioned and it s completely unclear when they will or will not have a clear field of fire at all 90 of the time their line of fire is blocked this is also related to the next point which is currently gamebreaking for me the pathfinding attack commands and also auto attacks of units are often broken especially in minor settlement battles units regularly lose their paths and targets yes i disbaled the guard mode sometimes they suddenly don t attack enemies anymore even if they are right in front of them for ranged units this is so severe that it becomes unplayable when barricades are suddenly set up and towers which are currently a bit too strong in my opinion keep shooting at the blobs the frustration is unbelievable in addition units block each other excessively often which makes the whole thing even crazier also other players experienced these problems the issue is discussed in the total war forum at the total war website further what i don t like so far about kislev and what makes the point above even worse are the many hybrid units with these you can actually only go to close combat because the change between ranged and close combat in the cities does not work at all also the units lose their appeal when they are all hybrid the basic hybrid units don t feel any different than basic archers or ranged units from other factions in tw w2 high elves archers also engaged in melee with their swords and they were not labeled as hybrid before overall the minor and major settlement battles feel very tedious and slow on the really huge maps of course this is amplified by the points mentioned above the limitation of the camera s zoom is also terrible here as you can only see rather small parts of the map and worst of all it feels like 70 80 of my battles so far are minor settlement battles maybe 10 sieges of major settlements at the same time i don t think that the supply system has improved player experience in the classic siege battles at the walls the defenders are still relatively helpless especially when it comes to enemy fire and destroying the walls also i think i ve already experienced the old familiar gate bug once here a few bug fixes and some changes to the gate and wall mechanics would probably have been much better my conclusion the developers have listened to the fans and implemented some things that improve the game enormously compared to its predecessor i was fortunately not affected by the performance problems either nevertheless the problems regarding the game mechanics in the battles are game breaking for me not only do they completely kill the fun of the game they also lead to extremely poor battle outcomes even with the greatest superiority which increases the frustration even more the developers really need to fix the pathfinding and attacks otherwise it remains unplayable for me unfortunately even the mortal empires map won t change that poor developers nice ideas some good intentions but still a long long way to go however if these points are eventually fixed in one way or another and the sandbox campaign on the large combined map comes along then this game in combination with part one and two could make video game history
