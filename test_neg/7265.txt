edit i just swallowed my pride a couple days later and restarted after the lost progress this time with steam cloud sync turned off over 20 hours in and i am addicted to this game in spite of the performance issues my cooling situation was so bad i took my side panel off for my pc tower and i still do not recommend it on the sole principal that capcom needs to understand exactly why the reviews have come to this even a lifelong fan knows right from wrong and it s wrong to release a game in this state and then also ask for more money on top of that i have been waiting for this game for years i was so obsessed with the first game that i played dragon s dogma online with google translate it was jp only just to play more of it when this finally dropped i immediately dumped 5 hours into it in a single session but at the end of the session my autosave corrupted and would no longer properly save the game i tried manually saving after that and it also didn t work then my pc froze up and it was utterly unusable i had to hard shutdown and when i booted the game back up my biggest fear came true and my progress was completely gone more than anyone i want to give this game a good review but capcom absolutely played us for fools and even snuck in micro transactions on the day 1 patch do not buy this until they figure their out
