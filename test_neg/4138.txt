2017 i don t usually write reviews but man this entire scandal has me really pissed off if you don t know what happened take two recently banned the use of the mod open iv which is a mod that is basically required for all other gta v mods they effectively killed singleplayer modding one of the primary selling points for gta v on pc now i personally don t mod singleplayer in this game but there are two primary reasons why i care about whats happening the first being the fact that take two made it impossible to use a majority of the awesome vehicles from gta online hydra etc therefore making the only way to use them being through modding this is an incredibly business practice and a balatant attempt to move players into the micro transaction ridden gta online the second reason why i care this might get a bit off topic so i ll keep it short is that take two recently bought kerbal space program a game i adore and also a game that heavily relies on the modding community it genuienly concrens me that take two might turn that game into a micro transaction unmoddable hole of a game that gta v is now continue to spread the word do not let take two continue through with this for the sake of gta v ksp and all other future rockstar games don t let this happen
