2022 this used to be one of those games you d always come back to the constant stream of new characters perksand maps meant that whenever you came back there d be a bunch of new things to play around with after they added their new matchmaking system the variety of perks that you d come across in games slowly decreased to the point where you see nearly everyone run the same exact build the entire playstyle changed from a fun casual game to some unwanted competitive game it s no longer about messing around with perks and seeing them in action it s about speedrunning the objectives in the most efficient way possible just so some invisible number rises behind the scenes toxicity has also skyrocketed heavily since it seems like both sides genuinely seem to hate each other i m not saying toxicity never existed before but it s way more prevalent now they have definitely made a bunch of good changes too but they re almost meaningless due to the effects that came from skill based matchmaking
