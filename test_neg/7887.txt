2020 good graphics and mechanics are sound fun little game until you meet other players there is no safe haven from pvp so don t waste your time playing the game and gathering treasure just camp an outpost and sink and loot everyone else don t even bother sinking them just stand at their spawn point and shoot them every time they re spawn game would be much more fun if there were some neutral areas to escape to
