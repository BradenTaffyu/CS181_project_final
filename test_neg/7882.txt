2020 unfortunately the game doesn t really encourage enjoying the game cooperatively unless you re hard into griefing other players i had fun with friends and some randoms after we ran into each other played the story only small portions unfortunately being pirates in a campaign but it was shortly and aggressively stopped when we all got jumped and griefed by people that would kill us and then revive us until they took everything so we couldn t scuttle and once we finally scuttled the game has a seemingly pre generated scuttle location and within minutes of us respawning the same group found us and just spawn camped and killed us despite having genuinely nothing until the game has something that supports small groups of friends wanting to play the game for the mechanics and playing a story i m probably not going to return in avoidance to having to constantly deal with people that grief and declare well that s the name of the game while they ignore the rest of the mechanics of the game and just spawn camp people for no reason other than just to kill them for sport edit while we managed to get a larger crew which makes us more intimidating to certain griefers it s still a hit or miss we ve made an effort to only play during the early hours of the day and mostly just on weekdays because as some of my friends put it it avoids the gremlin hours which are to be the people that play at later times just to troll and be aggressively rude to players something i did learn that helps if you get into a server with griefers just have your friends quit and reload it ll put you in a new server since there s a max of 6 player ships which can sometimes help you evade the trolling griefing
