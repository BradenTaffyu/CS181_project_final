2022 unfinished game and with lot of less features than the previous one multiple bugs lot of them really big cathay faction doesn t have any adventure battle except the last one no story battles or weapon battles nothing less heroes lords traits for defeating legendary lords are boring automatic resolve is broken and make the player lose tons of units even when it predict you won t settlements battle were reworked to make them more fun and interesting but instead they have become tedious and you just want to finish them as fast as possible lack of story writting they said this was going to be the most focused on it but instead we didn t receive anything mechanics of the game like the rifts make it really boring and frustrating to play map feels worse than the previous ones with lot of empty regions diplomacy system is much worse and the ia doesn t make any senseto sum up play wh2 instead of this
