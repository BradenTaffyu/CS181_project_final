dragon s dogma 2 is a game that as a fan of ddda i really wanted to like unfortunately at every turn i get the feeling that capcom didn t try to make dd2 but rather dd1 2 and what they ended up with is dragon s dogma 0 7 and at the point where i can say i had fun with the game i absolutely cannot recommend it certainly not in its current state short summary to be expanded below character editor audiovisuals improved combat system and game formula lack of new game option fixed but worth mentioning re engine optimization and technical graphics side microtransactions developer statements and unmet expectations fewer monster types than in ddda simplified armor system and overall equipment classes and skills pawn system worse than in ddda storyline endgame eternal wakestone character editorprobably the best character editor in capcom games which besides visuals slightly affects character statistics mainly endurance and its regeneration carrying capacity and melee weapon range audiovisualsdespite some shortcomings facial animations the game looks really good models animations there s not much to complain about here the music doesn t particularly stand out with a few exceptions and it lacks something as characteristic as the main theme from ddda unfortunately the technical aspect related to graphics disappoints improved combat system and game formulathey moved some skills from the original game s weapon skill to core skill which immediately improved combat here you can really feel progress compared to the original because fighting is simply more enjoyable similarly the core of the game remains unchanged from ddda it s still an action rpg with an open world somewhat trying to be like what if monster hunter worked in an open world medieval fantasy setting now on a significantly larger map where west part of the region is a different biome lack of new game option fixed but worth mentioning wtf capcom i find it hard to believe that no one absolutely no one during the game s development or reviewing process noticed the absence of such a basic feature as the new game option it s like some grim joke from a game dev re engine optimization and technical graphics sidecapcom is heading down the same path ea recently stumbled upon pushing for all studio games to be on the frostbite engine here you can clearly see that the engine is barely keeping up when forced to generate an open world with a large number of enemies npcs and more options than the closed corridors of resident evil locations the optimization sucks especially in cities related to how the game calculates npcs and the game should not have been released in such a technical state furthermore there s something off with the implementation of rtx and dlss as enabling both options noticeably degrades the game s appearance and this is a problem not just for me as modders have already fixed it working much faster than capcom microtransactionsyou might have already read somewhere that microtransactions in dragon s dogma 2 are okay because everything or almost everything can be obtained normally in the game however this is a single player aaa game it shouldn t contain any microtransactions and it s a mistake on capcom s part especially since you can practically get everything in the game without much trouble it was an unnecessary move that brings more pr backlash to capcom than benefits developer statements and unmet expectationsanother aspect that looks bad is related to the developers statements about the game and how it was marketed before release you hear about how the developers don t like fast travel because it s shortcut how they want their game to be so engaging that players don t feel the need to use fast travel at all what do you see after release microtransactions with a fast travel pack another issue is with the game s announcements quoting one of the trailers the game will offer what we ve shown and much much more the problem is there s nothing more practically all the most interesting elements of the game were shown in the trailers but more on that later a third issue is i m not sure if this is confimred that dragon s dogma 2 had a much smaller dev team than other flagship capcom titles fewer monster types than in dddacontinuing the above thought i refer to the trailer with the sphinx the creators promised more of complex monster encounters there s literally nothing more like that in the whole game the sphinx is a one time encounter the fight with it is completely optional and quite easy to miss there s another monster definitely less complex but if you remember zorah magdaros from monster hunter world and weren t a fan of that fight i have bad news for you there are fewer types of monsters than in the predecessor moreover not only are there fewer monsters but their population is spread over a map about four times larger which simply makes everything feel the same everywhere the fact that despite the larger map the distances between enemy groups seem even smaller than in ddda doesn t help making fighting all the time start to feel tedious in the long run just to be clear here s a numerical comparison of monsters small and bosses together in ddda and dragon s dogma 2 ddda 92 types of enemiesdd2 57 types of enemies simplified armor system and overall equipmentthere are fewer options regarding armor in the game leading to situations when using a riftstone pawns are dressed in very similar gear capcom claimed this solution would increase diversity in ddda there was an armor system where you separately chose the clothing layer and the armor layer this has now been simplified to one category per body part except for the head where some items are treated as cosmetic and can be worn with a helmet most often it s some kind of mask or glasses another criticism is that there are no horizontal choices here practically every item has its clear upgrade every category of item has the best item you want to find did i say find i m sorry i meant buy in the game about 95 of equipment can simply be bought from a merchant along with the best items available in the game i m not sure if this is a flaw but it s worth mentioning the chest system has been changed from ddda and now contains predetermined items but their contents never respawn unfortunately most of the things found in chests are junk or consumable items
