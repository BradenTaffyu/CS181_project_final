2019 tl dr a solo mmo full of complex mechanics and grinding which ultimately falls flat due to digital extremes lack of imagination and skill in utilising a solid system avoid if you expect any sort of social experience enjoy if you just want to grind gear and kill the same 3 races of enemies over and over while comparing the size of your pp with random people in clan alliance region chat do not expect any form of team play spending money not a must but highly advised unless you are immortal mr19 3 months time spent in missions 555 hours the game is very intriguing and unfamiliar at first it takes a while to understand its hidden mechanics and optimal ways to play it that didn t discourage me since i m used to using game wikis i rather enjoy complex game mechanics and there are plenty in wf at the beginning the weird story revealed through quests that shed some light on the strange universe drew me in i quickly realised that it s better to set matchmaking to solo otherwise the mission objectives are accomplished by higher level players before you even understand what s going on and what you need to do but that doesn t go on for long by the end of your second planet you are familiar with almost all the game modes and can use the help of random players when fighting your way through the star chart fast forward 3 months of intense play focused on optimising the time spent in game and rushing to the end game content i realised it s more efficient to set matchmaking to solo again because people are either bad which can ruin runs in a couple game modes or slow which is what you re trying to avoid in a game that is doing everything it can to prolong your play time with grinding and rng this might not sound too terrible but this is a pve mmo an mmo where solo mode is the best way to do things efficiently in the end that is not the current state of the game it is built into its foundation the only reason you want to play with other people is to increase enemy spawn numbers so you can increase the amount of drops resources gained or when opening relics since it expands your reward options resources become a non problem after you get to a high enough level after unlocking all the content in the game you only need kuva for rolling rivens endo for upgrading mods and prime parts for the trader baro ki teer that shows up every 2 weeks i expected this game to have some semblence of a hard cooperative game mode a game mode where people need to communicate plan set up specific builds maybe something similar to rpgs where you have dedicated roles like tank dps support crowd control etc the only game mode that requires any real planning is eidolon hunting the loop revolving around how to get you started is ridiculous you need to hunt eidolons in order to be able to hunt eidolons efficiently then you hunt eidolons some more so you can hunt eidolons even more efficiently they are a closed loop with barely any impact on anything outside of them the talent focus trees they help you unlock are mostly 90 used for upgrading your operator which is used only when fighting eidolons and one other boss in the game and pressing two buttons in kuva siphons floods for which you need 0 focus upgrades in the last year and a half 18 months after they introduced the second open world area orb vallis fortuna there has been zero new content added de are only making little balancing tweaks and changes adding a new frame and weapon every few months they ve added a game mode disruption which is anything but refreshing although it at least has the highest reward potential of all the game modes speed wise adding weapons and frames is welcome but those are just tools used to accomplish goals for me content equals new goals new missions new bosses new quests new mechanics changes done to balancing shadow rendering and recycling existing content does not equal new content two weeks ago they have finally implemented the first part of the dreaded melee 3 0 changes and now i know why they were dreaded they have completely annihilated the current melee meta utterly nerfed range on the large weapons made two of the most used mods obsolete and made melee weapons far less enjoyable overall i was never focused on melee so it didn t affect my play style but i was hoping it would open up more possibilities not simply nerf the strongest ones this has had the reverse effect melee is even less not more appealing that is de s modus operandi it seems they introduce powerful gear into the game high level people spend days of in game time to farm upgrade and use that gear en masse de dislikes the weapons are so popular de nerfs the best weapons so people are forced to use the weapons that are subpar this is not a good way of broadening viable options this ties in directly with their concept of game difficulty they believe that making the game more difficult equates to stripping the players of their hard earned power a direct example of this is the way you get your hands on the newest released frame grendel they force you to play 3 different game modes without any mods the mods you ve been farming this entire time spending weeks to perfect this is not only disheartening tiresome and boring it shows a complete lack of imagination it s simply not fun then there are the new liches this is supposed to be regarded as new content fine let s say it is you play any grineer mission of a certain level to have a chance of spawning an enemy killing it spawns your personal lich that is randomly generated based on the frame you used to kill it then you need to grind kuva siphon missions to have a 50 chance only recently raised from 30 chance of gaining one of four requiem relics relics complete lack of imagination yet again then you need to farm all the relics to get the 2 uncommon drops from each of them max 40 chance per relic which makes 8 mods in total then you need to grind random missions to gain information on which order to use 3 of the 8 mods in in order to be able to finally kill the lich or just stick random mods into random slots and hope for the best everything regarding liches happens in already existing game modes in already existing missions in already existing tile sets fighting already existing enemies that are very very slightly altered the reward an existing weapon slightly altered by randomly generating a bonus stat this is not new content this was the final straw that has led me to abandon this game the potential seems huge but they are doing nothing to expand the experience instead opting to recycle and tweak the shallow content which you discover in your first 100 hours of play i have zero confidence in digital extremes ability to make content that would make me excited to ever play this game again
