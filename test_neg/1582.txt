ca makes me want to cry myself to sleep and keep my wallet locked in a 5 feet dense metal safe the greed they show is immense their respect for their community and playerbase is low and whats more is that their development of the game is sloppy it can take years for a single bug thats well reported to get fixed and the multiplayer works well 50 50 half the time when its risky to invest hours of play with friends it stops being appealing to really enjoy the beautiful warhammer fantasy universe and actually enjoy the amazing gameplay that definitely is there its undoubtedly an amazing game but i still cant in good conscience bring myself to recommend it to anyone especially people new to the genre etc dont feed someone that chews on your hand dont give in to overpriced dlcs with minimal content respect yourself and your wallet
