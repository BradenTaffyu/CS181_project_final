2019 the game is great but the game has a lot and i mean a lot grinding i realy have fun playing it but sometimes i feel its waste of time and i really dont understand whats the point of playing warframe if you do all the quests all the mission and you take the items you like then what i mean when i was playing world of warcraft if you take all the pvp gear then you have to find a team and rank up you elo the warframe pvp system is dead no one plays it and sometimes when i log in in the game i really dont know what to do
