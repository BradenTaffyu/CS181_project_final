2023 tl dr i want to leave a mixed review but since it s one extreme or the other negative review even if there s plenty to love now for the meat of it the corp speak from the latest news is hilarious and a spit in the face for the people who want to love the game but can t you know the countless people who want to sail around and enjoy the myriad of pve content the game has to offer but keep getting murdered and griefed at every which turn and of course when people bring it up online the best in gaming community just fires back with git good or play something else it s this community that makes me avoid everything in the world from being around the community see someone docked at an outpost avoid them like the plague go find another outpost see someone out at sea again avoid like the plague go the complete other direction while using your ship s speed advantage that they don t explain for new players and everything i ve learned i ve had to read online that said i d be remiss to say there isn t plenty i enjoy seriously i plugged in 100 hours before i knew it and want to actively spend more money on the game to play pirate barbie vibing with some fishing sailing around from gorgeous waters and islands doing quests voyages taking in the charm of all the npcs they ve sprinkled about the music the sound design there are so many cool things going on i cannot emphasize this enough i genuinely and completely want to adore this game but the community that microsoft rare wants to tote as being amazing is honestly anything but when you encounter them in game will i probably try and do a few more commendations to keep myself occupied after this review yes but until they finally add a means for the pve community to enjoy themselves without fear of griefing cheaters at every which turn i ll move on before too long unless my friends want to hop on
