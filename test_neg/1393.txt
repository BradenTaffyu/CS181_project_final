2022 the game is very good so far 10 hrs in the pc port is atrocious no fov camera settings no ultrawide support invasive anticheat system that prevents above issues from being fixed theyve been fixed by modders already but you can only play offline if you dont want to get banned by the easy anti cheat crap stuttering problems im not experiencing these because i have a fat system but can be a problem with lower specs just got big slowdowns during one specific mini boss edit seems like some people are having problems with xbox controllers too my review is negative just because these issues the game itself is amazing and if you don t care about all these things and you intend to play with controller you will like it otherwise prepare for a lot of tinkering i enabled comments in this review so you can enjoy the crybabies raging and crying down there
