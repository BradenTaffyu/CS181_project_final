2023 only reason i play it is because i paid 70 for it here is what i have experienced so far 1 if you re good at this game activision will make sure you are not whether the skill based damage is true or not i have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun with no attachments one shots me also no matter what gun you use you will always be beaten by a pistol especially a revolved get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big how 2 if you bought the battle pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers congratulations now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them or quit the game and restart it to use them every time you earn a token it doesn t register so you have to relaunch the game 3 if enemy team talks during the match in between rounds on s d or after the match you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time until you quit the game and restart 4 whoever designed the ui my god hideous you remember back in bo1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away well now you have to scroll to get to the other half scroll this is very minor but still how did older cods have better uis than this reminds me of that scene from the movie ready player one when they put up all the ads on the screen look it up 5 the players are the same no explanation you know exactly what i mean we all do they don t play any different here overall 70 for this is not worth it at all this game does have many small issues but many small issues is not better than one big issue you would ve had more fun buying playing cyberpunk 2077 on launch day if you re considering buying this game don t do it now i have fun maybe 30 of the time but i can t let 70 go to waste edit steam told me i played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review here s my revision still sucksedit allowing comments but only if you re a cod mwii hater just like mefinal edit this game is i am uninstalling forever
