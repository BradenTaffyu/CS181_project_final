at it s core this is a good game however it s brought down by some terrible design decisions and bad performance to be as concise as possible dragon s dogma had an appearance change that you could buy with rift crystals and one of the ways to earn rift crystals was by buying them with real money you know why nobody complained about it in that game because you could actually start a new game whenever you wanted to do so unlike in this sequel incredibly stupid oversight or cynical attempt to sell microtransactions while making the game far worse in the process you be the judge personally i m left wondering how much of this game might ve been made artificially worse to potentially sell me something on top of that dragon s dogma 2 runs like garbage has worse keyboard and mouse gameplay than it s predecessor it s plagued by denuvo and i find myself remembering that i paid 70 for this game while also being past the refund window maybe after a lot of patches i ll change this into a positive review but this is a pretty shameful release in terms of improvements i really enjoy this game s character creation too bad the game goes out of it s way to prevent me from actually using it much on a similar note improved graphics are nice but i d much rather have the game run at least somewhat well instead i feel like this is one step forward and two steps back the sequel update after game completion having finished my playthrough i m now only more convinced that this sequel went backwards and it s hard to justify playing this over dd da certain vocations are acquired so late in the game that they might as well not even be in the game at all i mean there are a number of baffling design decisions displayed within this game but this is a great example i can see what they were going for by not having all of the vocations immediately available for use in the capital although i m not sure that i agree with the decision yet what i can t understand is who thought it would be a good idea for magick archer to be acquired so late that you d be unlikely to even be bothered trying it much less leveling it two of the original game s most enjoyable vocations are entirely absent here you can equip four abilities as opposed to six in the first game and this is especially noticeable on sorcerer again i just don t get it what were they going for here it seems like this game has been obstructed at every turn by questionable design choices which seem to add nothing boring sidequests even in comparison to the first game at best it s a problem which hasn t been improved here all vocations have less abilities and augments to choose from and there are also less gear slots with a noticeable lack of options in general what gear this game does have is subjected to what are sometimes bizarre restrictions limiting the effective options to a couple pieces of armor for certain hybrid vocations the story is a step back from dd da the dragon in particular is barely a character at all anymore he doesn t even have a name in dd2 meanwhile he was incredible in the first game in fact the confrontation with him perfectly encapsulates how this game is an uninspired clone of the original game despite failing to include most of what made that game enjoyable aside from the combat seriously watch the sequences in question from both games back to back they speak for themselves by the time i finished my playthrough i d acquired one portable portcrystal and i could ve purchased another keep in mind that i played the game blind so that s two in a game with an open world four times the size of the original as stated by the developers now granted i m certain that i missed something but i could also make the argument that the fast travel solutions in this game are unintuitive and insufficient consequently a large portion of my play time was spent traversing backtracking and all the while running into the same goblins saurians harpies over and over again it s mindboggling how dark arisen added the eternal ferrystone after all the backlash over the backtracking in the original game and yet it s entirely absent here despite this game suffering from the same problem and the problem is actually far exacerbated here as i was getting at in the previous point this game has a fairly severe lack of enemy variety most of enemies it does have were ported from the first game despite that dd da still has a greater enemy variety than dd2 no equivalent to dd da s everfall or bitterblack isle in fact dd2 has little to no endgame content whatsoever so as a result my favorite parts of the previous game simply aren t in this game at all in and of itself this wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing but the problem is that this game isn t so much a true sequel as it is a reimagining of the original game yet in it s current state dd2 is inferior to the original ng is rendered mostly pointless by a lack of any sort of hard mode or scaling difficulty by the time you reach it you ll annihilate every enemy in your path while facing zero challenge frankly i d have preferred a quality remaster of dark arisen over this game at least as it exists as of the time in which i m writing this review it genuinely feels somewhat bad to even write this as dd da is one of my favorite games tl dr don t bother with dragon s dogma 2 unless the graphics of dark arisen are a dealbreaker for you and 70 is asking a lot when considering how many issues are present within this game dd2 is entirely carried by it s combat and even then there are less options here than there were in dd da most likely a lot of this will change in future patches and inevitable dlc but i m reviewing the game as it is now at it s current price
