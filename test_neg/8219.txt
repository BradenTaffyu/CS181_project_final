2020 tldr noita has fun parts sandwiched between incredibly punishing buns punishing in ways that aren t engaging in ways that you can t learn or improve from there s a thousand ways to die aka get noited many are sudden wands with electricity spells will emit sparks which fry you if you equip the wand underwater so you learn to respect lightning early game flask chucking alchemists can highroll acid and lava flasks which melt you in half a second so you learn to strike from afar when struck freeze barrels fly around propelled by leaking gas and can explode for more than your max health so you learn to keep your eye on the barrel end game wands have more than enough power to gib you with a ricochet so you learn to read before firing while such deaths may feel harsh they lead you to an improved approach for next time that s part of the gameplay cycle and i embrace it but then there s other times when the game gives you no choice but to die early game events totally outside your control worm spawns can trigger player punishment mechanics that spawn impossibly strong and practically unavoidable enemies into inter level safe zones the devs put in measures to reduce this but didn t remove it entirely interesting because it s not like they re being asked to solve global warming or cure aids this is their own game and they should have 100 control over it a not uncommon mid game enemy can stunlock you with huge painful aoe attacks extra fun when the knockback clips you into a few loose terrain pixels preventing you from moving the devs added a mechanic to free you from loose pixels but it doesn t kick in until after 10s by which point the ashes of your ashes have been reduced to ashes basic enemies can pick up and use world generated random wands instakilling you from outside your screen with a single long range end game spell there s no sensible counterplay barring possession of a real life rabbit s paw your best option for progress is to beeline to the next level s portal actively avoiding exploration in a game where exploration is ostensibly a core mechanic depending on your luck this paranoid approach may leave you pitifully unprepared for the final encounter and regardless of luck you ll have skipped much of the fun along the way nobody wants to end their hours long super careful run by getting their tits nuked off by an unseeable enemy it s frustrating and unfair to die unpreventably and as you get better at the game more and more of your deaths come from unpreventable causes you have no control you exert no agency you are no longer playing noita noita is playing you some hardcore masochists might tell you differently but i say this it s not the 80s anymore game technology has advanced to provide a better experience game design and philosophy should advance too
