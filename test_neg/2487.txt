2022 good game but battle passes trigger fomo fear of missing out followed by buyers remorse when i realize when these systems work as intended they hold me hostage they invariably make playing a chore rather than something i do for fun i ve just run out of steam if i could knock the battle pass out in a week or two maybe but it takes up so much of your time that i ran out of energy for the game and in some sense for the genre as i ve moved on to extraction shooters like tarkov and hunt instead the latter which sadly is adopting the battlepass model since apex is f2p i m not sure what they could do to keep things fresh and keep the money pouring in more maps more characters regular cosmetics you can earn or buy i don t know but something has gotta give
