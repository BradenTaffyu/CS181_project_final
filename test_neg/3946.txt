2020 once upon a time in a faraway galaxy i bought gta5 everything was going well i played 400 hours a few months later i really wanted to play it but that s bad luck epic games handed out the game completely free of charge as a result of which many schoolchildren and other unpleasant toxic kids filled this game which is why it is simply impossible to play and add crash servers or the inability to enter the social club to completely remove my desire to play i can t enter the game for the second day what is wrong with this game yes it s not so she is overwhelmed by a bunch of donat cheaters and modders one day i wanted to start a task for shipping but bad luck fxck s modder just deleted my car as a result of which my goods disappeared and i was simply simply thrown out of the session subsequently i could not enter the game as an error occurred in my cloud saving and i had to wait about a day then epic games handed out the game and the server crashed thanks to you rockstar games and steam i will not play this garbage anymore as it will probably not bring me any more pleasure thank you all and good trips on insurgents
