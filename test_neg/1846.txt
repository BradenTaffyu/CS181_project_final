2022 this used to be a review about how much of a mess this launch was let me clarify it is still a mess half the factions you paid for have bugs so severe they can ruin playthroughs when chaos dwarves came out i stopped playing as there was a fatal crash that came with the tooltip update this took i believe over a month to fix the game gets no updates some say only one dude is in charge of updates all together and honestly i m at a point where i m willing to believe it they are pooling their money into other projects all the while draining their succesful franchises for corporate profits they use their employees as meat shields saying costs are up they ve made record profits i d be surprised if 1 of the money made from price gouging will go to employees and not the ceo who seems to be an ardent defender of this change i wonder if this could have to do with the fact ceo s make around 400 more money on average than normal workers most of which comes from boni gained by price gouging such as this none of this will go to the working people all of it will end in the pockets of people who openly despise you let me also here just address the elephant in the room 150 price increase yes you did not misread this is real this is reality as absurd as the idea of a 150 price increase sounds nothing more really needs to be said they killed three kingdoms for cash now they re killing this is this ca s fault is it sega s fault does it matter do not support it this game the people behind it do not respect you and don t be a fool you can buy a good game like baldur s gate instead and that s my recommendation leave this accursed land of warhammer 3 and never return
