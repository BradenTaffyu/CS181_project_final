2023 while clearly crafted with care in some respects i cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game the reason behind that is what exactly you are buying a pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours and the crux of this review a dilapidated abandoned mistreated unfinished barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience if you like warzone and plan on just playing warzone then just play warzone there is no reason at all to buy this game they treat classic multiplayer like it s just warzone weapon leveling simulator and the problem with that is the perfectly good other wz weapon leveling simulator that is also free dmz if all you care about is leveling weapons for wz look up farming tutorials to use in dmz if on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed i was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated but honestly it s not worth any more time than i ve already wasted writing this review just settle on this the game feels like it has 4 maps there is no 9v9 or 10v10 post launch seasonal content focuses 95 on wz and dmz the free aspects of the game lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up dopamine down dopamine cycle etc i m upset because the game had so much potential to be special i hadn t played a cod game since the first black ops before i got this game and i was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support mw2019 got on launch and post launch but after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2 it s clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point four months after launch it s just sad and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this
