2022 remember when sledge had a 1700rpm submachine gun secondary weapon with an acog scope attached and the community hated it ubisoft never learned from that mistake and just about every operator added after 2017 either had a extremely high rate of fire primary or secondary turning the game from a tactical shooter into a flick fest devoid of all skill it s not only the gunplay that they decided to lobotomize but the operators and their abilities too long gone are the days of positioning and timing welcome the new age of pressing a button at no cost to yourself to completely inconvenience everyone on the entire enemy team no matter their position or status thank you ubisoft for ruining a truly unique game who s gap in the genre has yet to be replaced so that you could cannibalize it into a hero shooter e sport with low time to kill
