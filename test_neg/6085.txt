2016 i played this game for more than 100 hours yesterday i had a dc during a game stuff like that happens i didn t really think about any big consequences after i started the game again everything was reset not just my rank was reset from rank 1 to rank 15 the level of all characters was reset to level 1 i literally would have to start over again 111 hours of playtime wasted because of a simple disconnect i looked it up in the steam forum trying to fix the issue apparently there isn t a fix it s a bug they told me of the million bugs this game has this one is by far the worst killers get stuck in pallets uploaded a screenshot of that incidence invisible objects survivors sometimes run into bugged items which have to be dropped and picked up again to be able to get used random game crashes bugged lobbys etc the devs are doing nothing about it they only release new content which leads to new bugs i was extremely frustrated i found a way to solve the problem i replaced my savegame with a savegame of a friend yes that s possible that means you don t have to play a single hour to get all perks and all characters to lvl 50 i consider that as cheating but hey the synchronization with the steam cloud seems to work differently in this game the devs have to do something about it which they don t update three days ago my whole progress was reset to 0 again i had a prestige 3 lvl 50 nurse and a prestige 2 lvl 50 bill i am going to request a refund for this game now because i literally wasted over 500 hours of my life i just disconnected from a lobby and everything was gone it s not a new bug btw it happens a lot but the devs don t care all they do is realeasing new content and creating more and more bugs i want my money back because i am never going to touch this game ever again
