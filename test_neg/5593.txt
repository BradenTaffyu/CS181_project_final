2020 game started off good but it kept getting worse and worse before i realised i just didn t enjoy it anymore first it was the removal of maps from the casual pool because they weren t balanced for a competitive environment in casual play say what you will but some of my most fun matches were on yacht old hereford favela hell even bartlett casual play is in the name it is casual play it is not a competitive environment that is why there is a separate ranked playlist and now an unranked version of said playlist for practice then it was the choice to rework old maps instead of creating new ones resulting in every map starting to look and feel the same way uninspired cold washed out and lacking details old house was unbalanced as hell but it had a charm that charm was being one of the only unaltered maps from launch and now the rework just makes it an uninspired boring unbalanced map i feel like every new reworked map feels the exact same way as outback does that same vibe then it was the addition of operators with abilities and aesthetics that just didn t belong in a game like rainbow six siege like alibi with her holographic clones nokk with her camera invisibility gridlock being way too overweight for a role in special forces combat what ever happened to the sas and the gsg9 operator styles tactical and stylish but with a focus on utility over style abilities that were useful but still grounded in reality then it was the gutting of the chat feature now being automatically disabled for new users blocking conversation between you and the enemy all in the name of fighting toxicity and in doing so this robbed siege of one of the funny parts of the experience the talking to the enemy team and being talked to when they beat you but then the worst part they added toxicity bans which could permanently lock you out of the game full ban no text ban no voice ban nope full shebang permanent bans for saying naughty words naughty words that mind you ubisoft decided for themselves i m am adult an immature one sure but nonetheless still an adult and i like to have control over what i read online i m fine being called all the names in the day i can cope with it but the fact that you are hanging the threat of a ban over this just makes it too much i can t support it anymore the game has taken a complete u turn on what made it unique and fun for me and now it is just a clone of overwatch but with real guns instead of fake ones it is a fun shooter and i imagine it ll go great for new players but i started in black ice and it has completely lost what made it fun for me personally even the guys i used to play with feel the same buy this on sale don t buy it full price
