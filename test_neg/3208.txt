2018 the game is great i love this installment of gta why the thumbs down the hackers are terrible not worth playing until rockstar does something about this edit 2 years later nothing has changed rockstar is just trash oh and don t think you can even play single player offline you won t be able to play this game that you paid for without being signed into rockstar i m avoiding all games from them moving forward
