2023 this game currently has a multitude of problems that is only exasperated by the greed of the developers instead of viewing bugs as issues that must be fixed they view them as easy ways to extort money from players desperate for a return to form i have played total war warhammer i and ii extensively and i can easily say that this game is the most boring game of the lot the fact that game breaking bugs are only now being addressed and they expect us to praise them for it i do not suggest that anyone purchases this game as it is i have not brought any of their currently released content for wh3 and i will continue to not do so because it is simply not worth it i find this game unplayable without workshop mods mods which take the modders a few minutes to fix many of the bugs left by creative assembly if you want to buy this game just buy warhammer ii it is simply a better game and if you do decide to buy this game in its current state don t bother with the dlc if you are really itching for it then sail the high seas as a lawless pirate
