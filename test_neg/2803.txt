2017 two years ago i was put in bad player pool by a modder after several weeks of trying to deal with support when they kept closing the unresolved ticket i finally gave up and stopped playing the game i come back 2 years later to find my account still in bad player pool i write a new ticket and start getting the same scripted response blaming me and having ticket closed unresolved this company is disgusting
