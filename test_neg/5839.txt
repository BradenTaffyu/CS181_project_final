2020 tl dr too many balancing issues toxicity and bad design choices i started playing this game during its third year after many people recommended it to me year 3 was different from the previous years because ubisoft had decided to add 2 operators to the attacking side instead of the usual attacker and defender year 3 season 1 also brought a new event called outbreak in season 2 ubisoft added 2 defending operators and went back to the usual attacker and defender and in season three everything started going downhill operation grim sky brought two new operators maverick and clash maverick has a blowtorch that can melt reinforced walls and clash has a riot shield with a taser no matter how hard ubisoft tried they couldn t make maverick balanced all the other operators who could destroy reinforced walls were loud and easily noticeable but maverick could silently create small holes through which he could kill opponents with ease clash introduced many new glitches and bugs and is disabled almost every season because her shield allows for players to make various exploits and ubisoft have done nothing to prevent this they just try to fix it after the damage has already been done season 4 brought the map palace which is much easier to defend than to attack and is simply too large for a game that focuses on close quarters combat in year 4 ubisoft decided that it would be a good idea to recycle weapons this was just one in a line of decisions that demonstrate laziness in the second season of year 4 ubisoft reworked the map kafe was this map a bit unbalanced yes did it need a rework no the problems of kafe could have been solved with a map buff like the one on consulate the rework of the map theme park that was horribly unbalanced arrived at the very end of year 4 2 step verification to prevent cheating was added 3 years after the game s initial release another proof of laziness is that bug fixes arrive only once or twice per season and balancing changes only arrive with a new season and now at the beginning of year 5 ubisoft have announced that starting from year 5 season 3 they will only be adding 1 new operator per season during year 5 there will be no new maps only reworks of old maps a rework of the map oregon has already been released a map that didn t need a rework yet we are only now getting a rework of the map house which the community has been asking for ever since ubisoft started reworking maps however the matchmaking is still bad and will have you play against people who have 4 times the skill you do ubisoft need to set their priorities straight i ve played this game for 399 hours the best feeling this game gave me was when i uninstalled it this game is not rainbow six this is a game with issues and developers who are unwilling to address these issues it s not worth your time it s not worth your money
