2016 i waited a while to write this mainly because i wanted to find quite a bit to write about nevertheless after 100 hours i feel this game can be thoughtfully and precisely judged more inportantly on all aspects of the game i ll be dividing this review into two categories single player and multiplayer let s begin single player single player starts off with the characters michael and trevor finishing a heist job from the north yankton bank they decide this is the last and final score yet not all good things end well they end up getting caught and one of their crew members die trevor escapes and that s where the story begins next and final playable character is introduced named franklin franklin is a petty thief who is hired by simeon a local car dealsman to reposess cars at the owners expense although the reposession is not so to speak authorised one day franklin gets the order to repo the car of a teenager and upon arrival franklin is met with a seemingly rich family after successfully lifting the car franklin drives away cheerfully not knowing michael is in the back seat after pursuading franklin to drive through simeons shop michael makes a deal with him to make some real cash thus involving franklin in a series of robberies and other heists once word gets out michael is back in the scene his old colleague trevor finds out who is furious because he thought micheal died all those years back that s pretty much the story you rob a few banks make some cash the story is quite well and fun i found no aspects to complain about and even had hours of enjoyment playing through it i actually wish it was longer or a single player dlc was introduced which involved the main characters after the robberies even though side missions and such could count as this i wanted more along the lines of the main story all in all the game is pretty much in it s current state only worth it for the story the reason why is in multiplayer multiplayer jesus christ multiplayer is a mess just to name a few problems hackers the will infinitely shoot rockets at everyone until their dead or at least until you want to turn on passive mode and ruin your experience dlc with the addition of some well planned dlc cash cards or microtransactions of in game currency became available the only reason i have a problem with this is that the ones that are worth anything at all meaning the money from the card can t be made in 20 minutes time are more than what the game is actually sold for yes that s right the developers are selling in game money for 50 or even 100 real money not to mention this was the spawn of their genius summer sale idea to innitially discount the game 40 only to remove the listing add a shark card to it and stick it up as 40 off but still cost the regular 60 move rockstar foreigners i myself find me to be a very multicultured person i don t mind at all anyone of a different nationality only when it hinders my gameplay example i m still sort of new to the whole online mode of this game so i often ask for hints during team modes such as heists so i was put into a lobby of non english speakers for a heist so i thought okay i can do this i just have to fly a plane i get the plane go to the area now i have to evade jets no big deal after flying around for 20 minutes with literally nothing happening the team finally gets their together and i can pick them up i fly off and we are supposed to lose the cops my other pilot who has the missles to shoot down the cops helicopters so we can get away faster decides he s going to take a break and lands at the beach i fly around for maybe 20 more minutes trying desperately to get these cops to go away and even when there were none around for miles they somehow still found me after i finally get them to go away i now just have to drop them off somehow my experienced skills did not tell me i have to stall my plane in the sky about 200 meters up just do drop the off so i spent about another 10 minutes flying around screaming what the is going on then my genius teammates start screaming at me fly tall any english speaker will not know what the that means so when someone says fly tall that literally sounds like nonsense so other helicopter guy decides his 15 minute break is up starts flying upwards into the air so i decided to follow the game goes to the cutscene and we all jump out after 2 seconds screen comes up the guy we broke out died i left the game don t get me wrong online can be some fun and by that i mean if you have passive mode enabled or are in a solo session multiplayer is literally cancer just avoid it at all costs
