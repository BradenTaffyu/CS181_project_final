2018 i got the bulk of my hours in 2016 when i would have recommended it however now multiplayer dead only lobbies going are tdm and the currently featured free for all where you get 2x rewards is even dead too my nat type is moderate but even if it was open all game types say they have 0 players 98 are in tdm no hardcore or s d lobbies ever first dlc zombies is really good others not so much unless you like playing the maps you already bought in the last games game all dlc takes up 180 gbs
