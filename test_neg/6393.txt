2021 at the moment with the new update unleashing an entire world of bugs that render this game almost unplayable at times eg survivors movement speed being noticeably slower than previous versions which makes juking and looping near impossible getting randomly stuck on nothing and not being able to move as killer and survivor glitchy animations a ui hud that is not massively user friendly frequent game crashes and freezing constantly being kicked out of groups and de pipping despite gaining or safety pipping after a match coupled with the quickly growing toxicity of the community that the devs seem to not care about and i would not currently recommend this game it can be fun don t get me wrong and i do still play it but as it stands i don t think i d be telling people to rush to buy this hopefully the devs address the issues and i can change this review to reflect that
