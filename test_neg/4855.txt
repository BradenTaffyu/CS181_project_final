2023 this game is honestly a joke why would i ever recommend a aaa full priced game where if you are mildly good at shooters of which i am barely people will just spam report you and you get automatically banned off of the game who in their right mind would ever even think automatic bans coming from players is ever a good idea if it comes from my own computer being scanned by the games for any injected software fine yea ban that it should be but it s just so dumb honestly the game is fine it just has in it ie ui is stop hiring mobile game artistsanyways i m just mad i can t play a bad game that i am clearly addicted to lol but ye the system is stupid i also bought the pass which i am unable to progress whilst the game decides i can t playlegit just buy a different game bf2042 keeps getting improved it s pretty good now and battlebit is meant to be decent
