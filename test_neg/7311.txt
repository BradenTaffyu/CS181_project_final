i don t write reviews and i ve enjoyed the game so far but mtx and denuvo are ways to really upset your single player game fan base and has really soured my opinion on it edit after completing the game i still can t recommend it i did enjoy my time to an extent but the combat carries this game hard the quests suck they re bland and most of them especially early game just have you running around or escorting the vocations are limited in scope compared to the first game i really found myself missing them and since completing the game i ve gone back to ddda no endgame the endgame that is there is awesome but it s time limited and you are forced to loop into ng speaking of ng what a joke back to the bland quests the long hand holding tutorial and the slow start all the while the difficulty is not increased i chose a different vocation at the start of ng i was just killing things in one hit with the basic gear once i had pawns i couldn t even fight anymore things just died half of the stuff died to the pawns i don t even have in my party the roaming pawns murder everything speaking of difficulty pre ng it s still a joke the game is just too easy period tldr the meat of the game the actual mechanics are awesome everything else is mid at best wait on this one as someone who loved the first game i m disappointed
