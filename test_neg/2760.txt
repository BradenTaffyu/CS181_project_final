2017 rockstar as i m sure you know a huge ban wave occured on the morning of june 25th around midnight i and many other players who claim to have never cheated modded have been affected the common link being that we have had money levels dropped on our accounts in modded lobbies you said that players who had this issue would not get banned what happened you are not allowing for appeals you are automatically closing our tickets you are banning us for a month you are wiping our characters many of us have had these characters for four years we deserve answers what happened to this rockstar all of the issues rockstar has had lately i am surprisingly say ing that i would not reccomend this game to anyone and i cannot explain how saddening that is so there you all go i ve never left a review but had to in this case hopefully answers come soon
