2023 i have very conflicted feelings about elden ring on one hand i spent more hours than i would like to admit going through the giant world that elden ring offers and enjoyed searching for hidden paths and loot in particular for the first say 20 hours i thought there was a lot variety with enemies bosses and environments on the other hand i ended up being very frustrated with the design of dungeons enemies and gameplay as the game went on reused assets and uninspiring level design became increasingly apparant and it felt like the game overall started to crash under its own weight while the lore at first was interesting and there are elements that i still like much of it felt cheap and unsatisfying the more i dwelled into it the memories of good experiences were increasingly soured by these faults and more in terms of presentation the game looks great and there are stunning vistas spread around the world and many of the enemies look and sound great it is not technically out of this world but definitely very satisfying to look at and listen to gameplay wise i initially experimented a lot of different tools and weapons that the game had to offer i played very melee focused and had a lot of fun in finding out how consumables and enchancements could change the efficiency of weapons and customize my equipment and strategy for each boss further into the game though i figured out a combination and strategy that ended up dominating more or less everything else i tried i tried out using magic as well but it didn t work well with the spec i had and using spells were also not that fun there was also an increasing amount of enemies and bosses with attacks that were more tiresome to deal with instead of being thrilled from beating a boss i felt more relieved of not having to deal with it anymore there was a great deal of reuse of enemies as well which made new encounters increasingly boring traversing the world as well became increasingly boring as it is very big but lacks ways for you to interact with it there are some interesting parts with hidden ledges and paths that lead to secrets but they are far between and you do not readily unlock new abilities or find equipment that significantly changes traversal in the big open world i was also initially intriged by the world and wanted to explore of it and learn about its inhabitants there are some serious issues that kept getting in the way however quests often involve talking to npcs in particular various locations sometimes you will get a hint to where the next part of the quest take place but many times there will be no hints at all while i understand the rational behind this design to make the world seem less gamey the open world format makes it likely that you will not find that place or so much time will pass that you forget about details regarding the quest on top of that i found a great deal of the stories and quests to not really have that interesting outcomes with little to no consequence in the greater scheme the main story itself also ended on a somewhat dull note and there more i look into it the more pitiful it becomes there are some elements though that i am still find interesting though which i hope get fleshed out further in dlc down the line all in all i end up with a negative feeling from elden ring which is a shame considering the good times i actually had i think it comes down to my desire to explore every nook and cranny which while fun in itself was ruined by repetitiveness if you choose to not do that you might have a much time with it than i did
