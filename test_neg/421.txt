2018 a solid game very good shooter mechanics very little support from valve all valve cares about is d o t a 2 only if valve focused on it s anti cheat the community is pretty toxic in csgo i still remember getting kicked from the game for being noob when i was new at the game and getting cheaters in opponent this really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players since they just wanna have a good game many people will say go to esea or faceit but 60 of the playerbase doesn t even know what they do so it s not really a solution to cheaters people like me just wanna get back from school work and have a fun game or two with friends hackers just ruin the game and the worst thing is people don t even kick them they wanna get boosted by hackers but don t understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned they get banned only 50 of the time they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking and cheaters omg where do i start valve please f i x your broken game there are literally threads on the csgo reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things v a l v e still wont fix it the fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame t h e fact that after almost 6 years valve still can t fix the chear issue in their 2nd most popular game itself is a shame what are you doing valve you guys aren t making a new game hl3 is a m e m e itself no support for tf2 just what the actual are you guys doing this game is like an abusive relationship hate it while you re in it but miss it when you re gone v o l v o p l e a s e f i x y o u r b r o k e n g a m e
