2022 gaming as a whole in the 21st century can be summed up perfectly by playing this game apex legends has bar none the best game mechanics in any battle royale and credit where its due respawn absolutely knocked the game fundamentals out of the park however all of apex legends problems stem from its overt and predatory monetization 1 loot boxes literal gambling that you can spend your life savings on2 skill based matchmaking in pubs is incredibly strong i am a bronze 1 player and i have not had a teammate lower than gold in a non ranked game mode for those who do not know strong skill based matchmaking is forced onto developers to increase retention and coerce players to linger in the menus and browse the shop the longer they are out of a game 3 cosmetic prices in the shop are valorant levels of greedy some skins you cannot buy individually or even earn in game and all event skins come bundled which further inflates the price 4 the amount of currency in this game is a psychological tactic used by developers to blur the line between real money and the corresponding premium currency you will never ever be able to outright be able to purchase the exact amount of coins in the shop to buy your desired cosmetic and will always have to spend more than you originally want to in order to do so which always results for you to have leftover currency which is also another psychological tactic used by developers to just push you over the edge to spend more money on this f2p title 5 despite all of this the battlepasses offered in apex legends have consistently been awful providing little value to those who buy them and the only decent skin is the level 100 skins which only apply to one weapon not to mention the vast majority of the cosmetics offered in the battlepasses are menial and only have 5 6 skins which only 1 2 of them are even legendary actually change the character noticeably 6 because all of this the only progression in the game is so bogged down that you aren t even guaranteed a loot box every time you level up which the lootboxes don t usually contain any of the premium skins bundled and price hiked in the shop not to mention the lootboxes effect every hero in the game meaning if you get a legendary skin for a hero you don t have it simply does not have any value to you whatsoever 7 the crafting material allows you to buy with in game currency skins and cosmetics you would otherwise gamble on with lootboxes however there is no surefire method to grind for this currency and the only way to get consistent crafting materials is to buy lootboxes outright this is such a massive leap backwards from titanfall 2 s super consumer friendly cosmetic shop where cosmetics had incredible value while also respecting the consumer enough to not make the cosmetics the only thing having any value in the game i bought into titanfall 2 s shop many times because of how fair and reasonable the prices value and quality of the items the developers themselves have outdone themselves on consistently providing quality content to the game the business side of ea and respawn are giving mobile games a run for their money in being the most egregious and predatory monetization for a aaa product all i ask is that respawn listen to their player base and to not forget where they come from because i can guarantee that if apex legends was more consumer friendly they would make even more money and the playerbase would be happy respawn and ea can do better and we as a playerbase have to hold them accountable if we expect any meaningful changes to such a predatory system
