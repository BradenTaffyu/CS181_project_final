2022 i have tried to like this i really have as someone who sank 2000 hours into warhammer 2 i couldn t wait to see what came next what came next was a truly awful gameplay experience there are problems everywhere from performance to ai to presentation and it s hard to know where to start when listing the failings the campaign mechanics are almost without fail terrible from the cathayan caravans causing you to endure the exact same battle turn after turn after turn to the godawful rift system forcing you to run around the map closing rifts over and over the campaign map is visually jarring the ai is predictable and dull furnished with unimaginative cheats at higher difficulty levels too easy how about we give them three stacks instead of one in my most recent abandoned due to utter boredom campaign 4 stacks from distant factions trekked across the map to arrive at my capital on the same turn for no apparent reason crossing hostile lands unmolested bypassing undefended settlements as they did so at the same time a swarm of 8 agents from 4 factions surrounded my leader s army as she wandered around apparently doing nothing other than standing looking at her merely finding my army to select it was a headache if this was near endgame and i was on the verge of victory i could understand but this was before the first round of rifts even spawned what else the revamped settlement battles are tedious beyond belief the defender is furnished with a steady supply of free towers to mow down intruders while the troops play ring a ring of roses in endless circles through the streets the autoresolve is so nonsensical that you are forced to play almost every battle even when the result is totally beyond doubt lest you lose hundreds of troops unnecessarily manually play the battle and lose 2 soldiers autoresolve 50 losses 4 turns wasted replenishment 4 turns that you don t have thanks to the fun destroying race for the rifts things may improve if the mortal empires version is released i ll take another look at it then maybe but in it s current state it is unplayable avoid tl dr appallingly bad play wh2 instead it is far far superior
