2019 as most people who are familiar with the grand theft auto franchise i will not be reviewing the single player aspect of this game at all because there are countless reviews of that online instead i will be focusing on the cesspool known as gta online the online aspect of this game has always been one thing and that is promising i remember getting home excited on the 1st of october in 2013 crazy to think that that is 6 years ago almost and loading into gta online for the very first time making my at the time god awful character anybody who has played the old gen gta games can vouch that the character creator was even worse than it is now and being so excited at this new world of possibilities fast forward 2 weeks and this was all that myself and a bunch of my close friends would play we would sink days on end into just roaming around the map having fun the world to us was limitless and we never got bored i remember being the last one in my friend group to reach level 75 and unlocking rooftop rumble which we proceeded to grind until each of us was at least level 120 to unlock the last bit of content after that all my friends kind of lost interest in the game but not me i started a hobby of collecting unique cars and meeting people and we would have car meets by the los santos customs this was an amazing thing for the then 16 year old boy whom i was i still remember the excitement of the first christmas event when we woke up and the whole map was covered in snow it was like an entire new experience one of the first games i got on my brothers ps4 was also to no surprise gta v and again it was like a second wind to the game there were more features on making your character look unique and the big one bigger lobbies and more new content to come i played this on and off every time new content came out because i had my original character from my ps3 and they had a lot of money which i worked way too hard for so the moment the dlc came out i would go on experience it buy all the clothing cars and properties i wanted and then played for a few days before leaving the game again during the 2019 summer sale a few friends bought the game and i caved and got it as well this was after a 4 year hiatus from the game so there was a lot to take in i immediately got back to grinding away to get a high rank so i could unlock all that the game had to offer as well as to make money to again buy all the things i wanted this led to me being up until 2 am on most nights for a few weeks just getting the most progress that i could after making my way to rank 100 and being satisfied i ran into a griefer who also had a mod menu at his disposal he stated that everyone should make their way to the airport in game as he is going to be dropping money for people i told him that i am fine since it was 2 am for me and i did not need his money i was completely satisfied with working hard for my money this person then dropped 2 bags of cash on me using their mod menu then in game i saw my cash go up by 2 billion i decided to log off because i didn t know what to do and as i was attempting to write an email to rockstar support to ask if i could get this money removed from my account that s when i received the single most pathetic copy and paste email of my life stating that i have been banned for 30 days this definitely made me feel betrayed as i was wrongfully banned for something that a lot of other people also get wrongfully banned fast forward to the 12th of august and i got my access to gta online back and i did the one thing i knew would keep me happy i continued to grind with the free content i was given from buying the premium online edition of the game to anyone looking to play online this is a great purchase and i made my way back the where i was at least in rank withing 2 weeks again i was happy with helping friends with their import and export missions and just all round messing around in the game that was until today when i helped a friend deliver cargo for their business as they had just started out after the delivery i decided to modify a car that i had been looking to find for a very long time after i finished modifying my car and making my way to my friend to show him this car i got interrupted by a haunting message you have been permanently banned from gta online please return to gta v this was followed shortly by the aforementioned copy and paste email but this one changed to say permanently now i know that i was playing legitimately and i was not cheating so i do not know why i got banned however i do know one thing the people behind gta online do not care about people cheating in their games you will spend a lot of your time trying to escape people who have godmode or aimbots or just people who are caging you and all round stopping you from enjoying your game those people might never get banned and if they do they will just buy a new account off of sites like and get back to making money by modding peoples accounts but if you are a legit player who spends a lot of time grinding to get money you are more likely to get banned by them i will never be supporting rockstar games again and that is a shame because as many of the other people who grew up with games their games have always had a soft spot in my heart
