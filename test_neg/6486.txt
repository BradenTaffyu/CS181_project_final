2019 honestly i really wish i could recommend this i enjoyed this game at first but it s steadily been getting worse i have witnessed myself going from enjoying this game constantly to almost always hating it there are two big problems with this game 1 every time the game is updated new bugs get introduced that are used to exploit the survivors and make it killer sided the game devs are also continuously making the game more killer sided to the point that it makes you feel like you should play killer to have fun new killers are getting more and more broken and the culmination of the killer perks makes it too easy to create a broken killer build survivor actions are always becoming harder to perform as of lately pallet dropping has felt unresponsive and breaks the game you or the killer will be teleported on some end of the pallet and you ll be hit half the time that is assuming you re lucky enough to actually perform the pallet drop when they get close sometimes you ll be the in middle of the animation and it will just be canceled out by the killer hitting you somehow 2 this community is one of the most toxic online communities i have ever been apart of it honestly sickens me how much hate is thrown around and how everyone wants to play this game in a toxic manner if you re not professional at this game and make a mistake instantly hated by your teammates if you re killer and make a mistake they call you out on it and beat your head into the ground almost every killer that i run into now tunnels people and or face camps them your chance of surviving is pretty zero if the killer finds you because they will hunt you down to the ends of the earth i ve even bare witnessed cases where my friends threw themselves in front of the killer and the killer still chased me down to make sure they could kill me the game devs have implemented systems to discourage tunneling and face camping but it seems like more and more killers are doing it survivors also love to play in toxic ways survivors are always ready to teabag in front of you and spam flashlights if you re not great at the game then be prepared to be pallet looped because people love exploiting this game both sides also love to use add ons add ons honestly break this game and make it even more unbalanced which is baffling if a killer brings the highest level of add on you might as well disconnect because you ll just be killed within a minute or two because the killer is now broken i really don t recommend playing this game unless you have friends who own and it goes on sale playing it solo is asking to be paired up with someone who will mess up a skill check and get you killed prestige doesn t mean a thing in this game prestige killers and survivors will still play like brand new players this game also uses system where the killer will host a lobby and everyone connects to them if the killer has bad internet then you re going to have a tough time the anti cheat system in this game is also non existent if you know someone is cheating then it s not even worth it to report them because they won t get banned the game devs have also recently decided that saving other survivors was too easy now your ability to save other survivors using pallets and flashlights doesn t exist i never see it work anymore supposedly you are still able to do it but i never see it work i hope you find this review helpful and that if you buy the game then you run into as little toxicity as possible good luck out there because you re going to need it
