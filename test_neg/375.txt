2018 lol making cs go free and adding battle royale doesn t make your cheater riddled game any better if anything you have made it worse well done you ve made it easier for cheaters to access prime matches a paywall didn t stop them from buying the game before so why would a cheaper paywall to play prime stop them now oh and by the way never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community all of those people didn t buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it it s just a huge slap in the face it would ve been perfect if you had released danger zone as a stand alone free to play title keeping the paywall and prime status sign up for cs go and work to further improve the both of them periodically but no so a thumbs down for you
