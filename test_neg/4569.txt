2016 this game is really fun to play at first after all the fun of new gameplay starts to get boring there s not really much to keep your interest the game has pseudo map building not random maps it copy pastes areas in the world so that every mission feels the same there aren t a ton of different ways to play just a few new tricks to do the same missions there are only about 4 or 5 different kind of missions to do and each planet has them repeatedly the only thing interesting after a while is getting new weapons which aren t really all that different from each other now i m not saying don t play the game i m saying don t expect to get a ton of hours of fun it is a fun game with a simple gimmick that gets very old really quick
