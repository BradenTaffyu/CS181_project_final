i have high tolerance for bad performance i ve played gotham knights before the patches hogwarts legacy at launch wild hearts forspoken bg3 s act 3 before the patches monster hunter world ib which is still a terrible port to this day believe me when i say i ve seen it all dragon s dogma 2 s technical performance is such a miserable trainwreck that even my resilience to these problems couldn t withstand it i will not rescind my review at any point in the future because individuals who publish products in this state are swindlers addendum game still has 4 combat skills only dragon s dogma had a great proof of concept for a combat system that could be expanded into something truly great yet here is a sequel with no improvement whatsoever i m about 4 hours into the game and i m struggling to name a single upgrade over the original that isn t the new graphics
