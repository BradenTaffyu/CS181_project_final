2023 look at this before you buyi ve played for a while and i really like it but there are two main problems 1 this is just one big attempt at sucking as much money out of you as possible the game is worth 60 which is a lot for a game and half the content isn t even available to you it s there ai can use it but the only way you can get access to it is buying dlc s and the other warhammer games for example i wanted to play the lizardmen so i had to get warhammer ii all the warhammer games are 60 dollars once i got it it only unlocked 2 lords out of the 5 or 6 i have to get dlc s to get the others and those aren t cheap either sega and creative assembly are a bunch of greedy pigs 2 why the heck do you need 120 gb for a game i don t have extra storage or anything so i had to uninstall half of my games just to download it worst of all the updates are like small zipbombs as i am making this review my game failed to download a 25 gb update because i m out of storage that s a game within itself update someone in the comments helped me think past my anger the size of the game is actually alright compared to games like gta 5 and the use of the past games for further content is pretty unique but the immense use of dlc s still suck
