2016 the game is very well made and it s a nice and unique concept i really love it but i need to give it a thumbs down as for now because of how much time it takes to play as a killer you need to create a lobby wait for people to join and apparently there is a bug where your lobby disappears from the system or something like this and you just keep waiting and pepole don t come i ve been waiting 10 mins 20 mins and people come and go but i still cannot manage to get a full lobby of 4 people and it amazes me because there are like 8k people online playing and it s impossible that atleast 4 people don t get in your lobbyif you really want to play as a survivor then you can buy it you join lobbies pretty fast but as a killer it s another storythey might fix this issue in the future but for now it s a thumbs down from me
