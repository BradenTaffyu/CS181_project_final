2016 this key and crate system needs to stop microtransactions belong in f2p games it wasn t that bad when it was just skins cosmetics etc but full on assault rifles and other weapons is unacceptable the only patches this game ever gets is just an exact copy of the patch ps4 got a month earlier no pc specific balance changes no performance improvements nothing as it stands right now the game runs pretty smooth for most people with a half decent rig but the graphics even while maxed out look nowhere near good enough for the amount of system resources this game uses which is what happens when you bog down an old engine with so many modifications that it was never designed for almost every weapon in this game is a reskinned model of a gun from black ops ii which is why all the guns feel so tired and old already sound effects for fully automatic weapons are still bugged as of 2017 see this thread for detailsedit this video explains the connection problems better than my example youtube video cod black ops 3 netcode analysis views 61 588 how good is the netcode of call of duty black ops 3 compared to other tripple a shooters and why do you take damage behind cover does black ops 3 really use matchmaking
