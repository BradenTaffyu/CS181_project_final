imagine paying out 70 dollars and still being treated as if you re playing a f2p game yep that s the current state of the call of duty series i admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging but after investing over 200 hours each in mwii 2022 and mwiii 2023 the gameplay hasn t justified the time and money spent there are numerous reasons to avoid this mess sbmm exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more bloated game size because of paid cosmetics and bugs glitches that haven t been addressed since the games releases both mw2 and mw3 not to mention the neglect of side modes like dmz mwz among other issues i could go on and mention other stuff such as how mwiii was initially intended to be a dlc expansion for mwii before they opted to launch it as a standalone game seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how mwiii single player campaign being the worst one from the entire series mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and i don t wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage tldr invest your money and time in a different game instead of this slop and cashgrab
