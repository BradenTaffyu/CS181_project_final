2020 gta v would be better without modders always killing everyone for no reason if you want to mod and make whales fall out of the sky it s whatever don t mess with my game play i ve spent hundreds of dollars on this game and i basically get a big middle finger for supporting the developer we can t even play online without someone destroying the game and ruining everything we have worked to create the hard way the way gta is supposed to be you work your way up from nothing and then you get to show off your power not hack your way up the ladder and kill whoever you please even if they didn t do anything why even play at all anymore
