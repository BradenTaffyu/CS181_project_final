2023 dead by daylight has a great concept a great line of killers and survivors to choose from and an interesting and engaging gameplay loop there are issues of balance as with any game and some stick out more than others call of brine dead hard ruin double exhaustion etc these issues will come and go however and many games can be well balanced and it can be a fun time however this is almost never the case the matchmaking is non existent killers or survivors who have fresh installed are put up against players of hundreds and even thousands of hours if you are playing with minimal perk setups on a new character to unlock their perks for other characters you are matched versus players with a full roster of rank 3 perks at times games tend to lean very one sidedly for killer or survivor you either win by a landslide or get curb stomped all of this could be overlooked for me if it wasn t for the community it s just so toxic the survivor playerbase and the killer playerbase don t see eye to eye on anything and both sides violently disagree on unspoken rules which items and perks are op and will insult each other at the drop of a hat honestly dbd makes league of legends look like a daycare new killers trying strategies get insulted and bullied by survivor parties of items and perks meant to remove control of your character for the most amount of time killers will tunnel and camp players effectively removing them from the game and making them unable to play if you don t get a well behaved lobby it ll be an unbalanced one whether i win or lose i tend to be more upset or frustrated than when i started playing playing killer is stressful and running into bully squads makes you want to disconnect but that s exactly what they want playing survivor you could do something that will make them target and tunnel you and again make you want to play anything else no other game have i seen a playerbase so driven into making it as unenjoyable as possible for the opposing side if you can push the toxicity and almost non existent balancing aside it can be a great game and i know many people that do enjoy it but i ve heard of and know people who are more relieved than anything when they uninstall it personally i play games to have fun i don t wish to get frustrated overly invested in personal ego competitions or unsportsmanlike conduct this game and its community are rampant with it all i gave it a fair shot and i couldn t recommend it less based on this community alone
