2015 this game is great until you go to play online it takes waaay to long to load online close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine and once you get there it is miserable to play nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money or just running around with invincibility killing everyone what finally pushed me over the edge is when i was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself it just stayed it only gets worse my friend and i didn t mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that i had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns about 30 seconds after that it was flooded literally i did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that i pass by and what does rockstar do nothing absolutely ing nothing to the point where i saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server it has gotten to the point where i don t even bother playing online anymore because you simply can t tl dr version rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers and until then do not buy this game if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you
