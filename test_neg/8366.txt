2022 conceptually the game is interesting and the graphics are great full stop that is it all the right bits put together in all the wrong ways the game is far to rng dependent which is a staple of the rogue genre they are going for however in noita the quantity of absolute trash the rng can serve up far outweighs the worthwhile drops resulting in the system just giving you absolute trash 90 of the time while you can mitigate this to some extent you do so by spending an absurd amount of time grinding out the first two levels ad nausea and getting gud as the fanbois like to say which is code for memorizing the insane quantity of absolutely opaque haha gotcha now your dead for the 1000th time with no meaningful progress mechanics this game throws at you all the while this grind will more than likely take place in the first two levels of the game which after about the 100th time of slowly and tediously combing every inch of each on every run trying to find any useful wands or spells will make smashing your face against the wall seem like more fun that this game so in brief unless you are willing to pump an insane amount of hours into learning the opage bs this game throws at you and love grinding the same two level of a game for hundreds of hours with no meaningful change to the gameplay or scenery or anything else then this game is not for you
