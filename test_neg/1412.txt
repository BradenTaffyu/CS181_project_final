2023 i really really want to love this game i ve played over 3000 hours of its predecessor and was beyond excited for this game to come out the main problems 1 cost dlc chaos dwarfs was the most expensive dlc to date but the upcoming shadows of change is a slap in the face to everyone who supported and loved these games it asks for 25 usd for a few units and three legendary lords prior examples in the previous games offered the same exact thing for 10 including one of the legendary lords being free for everyone even then the free lord would still be high quality more often than not free ones have included imrik and rakarth for the high elves and dark elves respectively which became many people s favorite way to play the entire faction 2 updates have slowed to a crawl the game is still littered with significant bugs nearly a year and a half after its release communication has been uncharacteristically absent compared to the norms of the previous games at times gamebreaking bugs like nakai s inability to recruit kroxigors the units he specializes in have been present for three months or longer this particular bug was fixed for free by a modder in about 5 minutes of work which leads us to 3 the game s future is uncertain and troubling a previous game in the total war series three kingdoms was met with a huge positive response upon release but the dlcs and updates seemed disconnected and disappointing for many players whenever new content came out gamebreaking bugs would follow including ones that would never be fixed when the purchases began to slow down the entire project was unceremoniously cancelled many people fear that this game might inherit the fate of three kingdoms the official response to this price hike has been troubling at best many people have invested hundreds or thousands of hours of this series and wanted to see it through dlcs were bought consistently and regularly because there was trust and goodwill towards the developer and while they may not have been perfect each would often lead to countless hours of enjoyment and unique opportunities and ways to play the game i and many others just want a return to form we want to be excited for new content not anxious many of us are more than willing to pay for content that shines with love and care such as what has already been accomplished in warhammer ii we want to feel secure in the game s future without worrying if or when the skeleton crew will be recalled we want to see that the game is cared for and that bugs especially significant and simple ones are addressed we want more open and transparent communication and to see that feedback is being respected we are upset because we put so much of ourselves into this game and want it to be as great as it can be living up to the potential that has already been created and witnessed if warhammer ii was any indication when the developers are allowed the time and resources to make something great the community by and large won t think twice about getting dlc that meets a respectable quality for the price we don t want the future and functionality of the game to be tied to exponential price hikes and radio silence we want something close to what we already had and what has already been made time and time again many have been invested in this game series for over 7 years many have been waiting with excitement for the conclusion to the trilogy of phenomenal games the people who have been hurt the most by this abrupt and inexplicable shift are the ones who have been there for years and have happily and willingly supported the game and all of its content the ask is only to get something close to what we already had to what had already been developed sold and delivered to us many times before for better or worse the treatment of this game will affect the future of the developer publisher and playerbase make it count edit may 1st 2024 i am pleased to say that it feels like things are finally turning around the developers have become a bit more communicative and they have addressed many major points of concern they started by pushing out hotfixes for various bugs and followed it up with providing much more value to the shadows of change dlc to make it worthy of its price point even after its release the thrones of decay dlc has also just launched with a ton of new content along with the completely new option to buy each different part of the dlc separately so far the game seems to be in a much better shape and future is looking far better than before speaking strictly for myself i am now satisfied with their change in direction and substantive response though it would not be unwise to hold off on preorders for future updates until they actually go live to make sure the quality is consistent
