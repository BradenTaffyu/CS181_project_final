2020 i have put in 312 hours on pc at the time of this review however i have about 3 000 hours on consoles gta 5 singleplayer hasn t really changed except a few minor graphical improvements and it can run super smoothly with a decent pc if you re going to get this game though you re probably getting it for online and that i can t recommend there s hordes of modders that can crash your game imprison you and overall make your life a living hell at the press of a button on top of that there s plenty of griefers that are willing to ruin your experience for no gain at all the online community for this game is corrupted by modders and griefers and there is no way to escape that unless you play gta online alone ironic side note rockstar will do nothing about modders if you report them unless you make a big fuss about it but by that time you re already getting griefed by another one
