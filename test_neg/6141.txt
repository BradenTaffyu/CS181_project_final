2022 after 600 hours into this game the sad truth is i can not recommend this game to absolutely anyone anymore it took me a minute to understand why am i feeling like this and how to put all of it into words but i will try my best to do so i ve watched streamers and youtubers play this game since pretty much from the day it came out and dreamed of buying it one day that day came last year when i got to try the game on epic for free and decided hell it really is a fun game and bought it on steam and even got all the dlc s i played both sides killers and survivors and maybe a bit more of the last one because i genuinely had fun bloodpoint system was rewarding and maybe just maybe a bit grindy having to get all those perks on every character but i really really enjoyed that because i knew what i was going for and that made me feel like i was playing for a reason then the so called new game improving patch 6 1 2 or whatever hit and ooohhhhh boy did it improve the game nope i ve been around the block once or twice and seen how badly companies mess things up this patch it s bad they changed so many perks it s hard to keep up both killer and survivor side to change the meta they said yet it actually feels the only meta that got changed was that the killers are camping tunneling and slugging players more than ever and oh god the disconnects and letting go on the hooks on the survivor side i ve tried again and again to enjoy either side after the patch but whatever the spark this game had pre patch it doesn t have it anymore i have 600 hours in the game and i can tell you from the bottom of my heart i m maybe mediocre at best or was atleast but i was learning and improving all the time sadly currently only survivors that win are either hardcore dbd fanatics or the killer is probably a bit newbie after the patch solo survivors have a hard time i ve found myself losing around 80 of the matches on the survivors side whilst on the killer side it s maybe 1 every 10 game where all 4 survivors get out why do they get out because they are either full out sweat mode friends talking on discord or i m literally focused on getting one specific guy down and don t want to stop the chase xd i ve had matches where i ve really wanted to camp and tunnel players down but always forgiven and left the hook because it s just not me only reason why i have ever stayed near a hook is because all the survivors are messing around next to it now after the patch even the killer side has gotten really boring i get 4k s without breaking a sweat without bringing any addons to the matches that s how bad it is going through some of the steam reviews you will see players crying how hard it is for killers after the patch honestly they are either trolls or are really bad at playing this game currently killers are stronger than ever before some more some less killers will get atleast 1 survivor if not more down 90 of the time and that 10 they don t can be because the map is really bad for the killer or the survivors are literally living and breathing dbd now let s talk about prestige there is absolutely no point in prestiging a character these days instead of 4x50 levels you had to go through per character before the patch to have max prestige and feeling like yay i was rewarded with atleast a bloodspraid cloth that shows i ve played the game a bit and maybe have earned it then now you have a 100 levels per character together with the killer side you have around 50 if not more playable characters oh and don t forget those are 100x50 levels to get 1 prestige level you got to go through 50 pages of crap oh but surely they increased the bloodpoint amount so it would be faster oh no they didn t you still earn 20k per match maybe a bit more on some matches if you bring a booster but most likely you won t be earning that because if you get a tunneler or a camper or some other deuschei kind of a player you will most likely get less than 10k points and get to waste a booster so if before you wanted to max out all the characters like me then after the patch you will have to spend not thousands of hours but half your life to actually get max levels on everyone currently i ve only seen 1 player in my matches with a 100 prestige level character and i am 80 sure that person was hacking on the community side it s a so so i ve met a lot of amazing people in this game that i am happy to call my new friends and i ve met complete and utter boot lickers you never know who you are going to meet these days i keep meeting less potatoheads in the games mostly noone talks in the chats after the game but when i started playing i really did have to block a few people because they were toxic as hell but to call all the community toxic is a bit far reached i have also seen a lot of people saying there are insane amount of hackers in the game if so then most likely ive been quite lucky not having to had any run ins with them with 600 hours in the game i ve maybe max seen 5 and that number is pretty damn good for an online game now if the game is so bad then how come it has so many positive reviews on steam let s go a bit deeper into that as well let s look for recent reviews with each passing day there s more and more negative reviews that actually try to point out issues with the game and the reasons why players don t like the game anymore whilst the positive reviews 70 seem to be coming from bot accounts that maybe have one sentence in it just to keep the rating up can t be that silly or blind to think that s normal now let s talk about the company bhvr i remember a time when they did things with a heart but these days it feels like an empty shell honestly they are on the same latter with ea and activision they don t give a damn about you as a player and even less so you as a survivor all the dlc s and in game battlepasses have probably costed me around 200 euros or so and today i felt like the only thing it got me was spit it the face with the current state of the game if it would be possible i would instantly ask for a refund and i got a feeling a lot of other players are feeling the same i ve started to notice that in the game as well depending on the time of the day and the side you are playing on you will be sitting in a queue it didn t feel so bad before but now after the patch has been live for almost a month i have started to notice it more what does that mean it means a lot of people have started to quit the game as of date i uninstalled the game myself and won t be reinstalling until they fix what they broke bhvr needs to find the spark again but they don t care they just care about shooting out more promoted killers and survivors to get a few more dollars in from a company doing things with heart and soul to a complete sellout who doesn t give a bit fat f about it s community or playerbase sadly there are still players who think they care and that s really heartbreaking to see conclusion in the current state i will not be recommending this game to anyone the patch removed whatever spark this game had and just isn t fun for neither side the prestige grind is completly pointless currently not enough bloodpoints to too many levels for nothing to gain killers are camping tunneling and slugging more than ever survivors are dcing or fast killing themselves on hooks more than ever and flat out you can see a lot of players quiting dbd completely this game was amazing but got ruined with the latest patch by yet another creedy company
