2022 tldr you got my hours and you got my 20 but if it weren t for spending time with my friends ruining a killers day irl you wouldn t have over the years i ve seen a lot from dead by daylight from staff being blatantly rude to fellow staff on livestream to the universally extreme toxicity of the player base but sadly very little of has been innovative gameplay changes from the times of only 4 killers to today s 29 the game has managed to become convoluted in all the wrong ways and survive exclusively on marketing itself as hard as it can to new people via licensed killers i do love seeing my hollywood favorites make their rare appearances but the clear reliance on featured killers for funding is becoming more apparent as time goes on 7 of the last 11 releases are licensed killers for example with one of these killers being a k pop star and another having been removed from the game due to an expiration of its license stranger things demogorgon it appears hard hitters are running out and original content is wearing thin no matter how you slice it 29 killers 33 survivors is admittedly an impressive cast assuming you re willing to spend up to 5 for each additional un owned killer survivor on top of the base game price if you don t you will not have access to their perks which are made to counter other existing perks in a rock paper scissors style battle royale of over 100 different perks in combinations of 4 this puts you at a disadvantage immediately upon purchase stopping here wouldn t be underachieving as there is a number of copy pasted ways to play the one single game mode they offer as a killer however this is also somewhat misleading as the game is only marginally affected by the killer survivors have a clear and extreme advantage due to the nature of the game s development balancing for an ever increasing cast of characters is absolutely not an easy thing to do however one thing has remained consistent throughout the years development has moved forward under the assumption that players will not have any way of communicating with each other irl there is no in game chat system outside of the lobby however everyone obviously circumvents this by using discord or the like dbd is absolutely an intense and fun game without voice chat it s the equivalent of a cheat code yet it s rampant in every game at every level and there s no way to stop it smurfs and friends alike will not willingly play the game silent with each other as survivors and for that reason with few exceptions hordes of survivor teams make playing the game as a killer at anything other than an extremely high level unbearably frustrating as someone who has spent probably 685 of my 785 hours as a survivor i can tell you that extremely minor coordination between only 2 out of 4 people can guarantee your success even at the highest level it s not even remotely close how much easier it is to play as a survivor than a killer this sadly encourages that extreme toxicity i mentioned early poor management of rank increase points referred to as pips in this game leads to the promotion of bad mannered gameplay in an effort to get ahead constant resets of the ranks in game reaffirms it doesn t matter in the first place and also further messes up the matchmaking as professionals will team up with brand new players it only takes a little time in between playing the game and having a life outside of steam aside from the additional monetization for licensed and original killers they also have a battle pass where they offer extremely pathetic cosmetics in favor of hoarding the especially nice ones for the in game store which they also offer i do not generally dislike battle passes or stores for entirely cosmetic items but when you sell one with the intent of holding back so you can fill the other with the more desired and expensive items in order to cash out on both it s scummy skins can be pretty sick tho for a game with an incredibly fun premise a sizable cast years of history and an impressive number of concurrent players it s sad that a worthless rank system extreme imbalance between coordinated survivors and the lone killer greedy business practices general human shi iness and only 1 single constantly updating game mode is holding this back from being a juggernaut game edit it was pointed out to me the stranger things perks are not lost to the shrine of secrets but instead are now standard bloodweb perks i suppose that s 6 out of 128 not to worry about but not really the point also you still can t use the characters
