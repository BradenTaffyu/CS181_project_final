2023 predatory business i love this game from the bottom of my heart and have played for almost a decade with thousands of hours across consoles so it aches me to say this but they have just published an update that removed almost 200 vehicles worth of content from the game for no reason it was thinly veiled under an attempt to better the browsing experience however no changes to the browsing experience were made at all still no search bar still no filter by alphabet or vehicle class nothing the sad truth is likely they simply wanted to remove cheaper older vehicles to encourage purchasing of in game currency or to bring them back in a special manner where they can drip feed to create artificial demand increase old prices again potentially costing players more even worse is they could be added to the gta subscription thing for consoles which is disgusting and slightly pay to win in itself considering hsw this is unacceptable predatory towards their own fan base and downright atrocious behaviour from a game company please follow suit and leave a bad review of your own complain to rock themselves
