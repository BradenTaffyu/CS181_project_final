2017 i don t even play with mods but shutting down open iv mods and claiming it was to stop online hacking is completely ridiculous and untrue as they don t even let you go online if you have them on take two s poor treatment of its pc players and its penny pinching for shark cards is going to turn a great deal of people against red dead 2 and grand theft auto vi in the future i love this game and have invested hundreds of hours into it but i can t in good conscience leave a positive review if they re going to treat people who support the game like this don t buy the game at full price or pay for a single shark card
