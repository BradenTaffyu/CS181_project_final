2020 literally the worst game you can ever pick upif you re buying this for online play let me say this it can be fun with friends and i mean you can spend hours on here having fun with mini games and even just fighting each other for the heck of it but lets get this straight loading times for online play take ages to load and if you tab out you will add 5 minutes to your waiting time if you want to play with a friend then get on your knees and start praying cause sometimes it s nearly impossible if you and your friend happen to get into a match then it s all fun and games until the hacker comes in i ve seen hackers come into matches and either attempt to leak my ip spawn gigantic stuff on my character so it s just impossible to play and i have to restart my game to get rid of it do some sort of glitch where i have infinite loading after getting invited to some dudes apartment use godmode and destroy my cars spawn kill me or they ll do the worst thing of all which is mess with the brightness of the sky textures or something and cause the game to get extremely bright or have a bunch of colors spazz out on my screen which has almost caused me to go into a seizure twice most hackers are usually not that bad cause most just use hacks to just get money but when you start making it so that you physically cannot play the game at all you re a gigantic problem not only that but a lot of people who i used to play with are banned for literally no reason after a gigantic random banwave hit and just knocked so many people out of the game 3 10 can be decent but hackers make it
