2020 if you re interested in the zombies mode which comprises the bulk of my playtime this game has plenty of content for it the complete package includes a whopping 14 official maps most with elaborate secrets and an endless amount of custom ones on the workshop unfortunately you ll need to pay a pretty significant amount of cash to get all of it despite the game being almost 5 years old activision has refused to lower the base price on the game and its dlc i absolutely cannot recommend purchasing the game dlc outside of a sale and even then it s still quite pricey
