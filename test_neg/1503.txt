2022 i m a big fan of the total war series and the warhammer games but i can t recommend the game in its current state the prologue s storytelling is incredible but if you already know how to play the game you miss out on one of the best total war cinematic stories i ve seen and get thrust into the main campaign which does an ok job but definitely doesn t compare to the prologue the gameplay loop has been changed around siege battles and in my opinion for the worse the addition of attila style defenses to minor settlements was a cool idea in theory but being able to actively place them in the middle of combat breaks the ai pathfinding and largely makes these battles unenjoyable i haven t even gotten to defend with these new features yet because the ai never attacks me anyways unless it s a doomstack vs the basic garrison so only the ai benefits from the new gameplay change when attacking it s even worse i will get my army to destroy a barricade or tower just for it to immediately queue up another one in 2 minutes the only solution is to quickly break a barricade then blob your forces through the chokepoint before it gets built again all while taking constant turret attrition from the ai which also doesn t seem cheese able with heroes juking the projectiles like in previous titles either the other solution is to cheese cavalry around the flank and capture the points behind the ai blob to destroy the turrets and win the battle that way so most of the minor settlement battles turn into auto resolves because i don t enjoy watching my tier 2 units get fatigued and ripped apart by the defenses and basic marauder spearmen one personal gripe but as the starter faction khislev is really underwhelming for me their tech tree is a jumbled mess of random technologies that all add random buffs to random units but not in any order that makes sense in the early game i want to buff my kossars but there s only 2 techs that do that melee defense and ammo reload meanwhile immediately you have access to a tech that improves snow leapord units which you can t even recruit for about 20 turns or so and only start with one when playing a specific starter lord trying to navigate the trees and find a good path that fits my playstyle is near impossible for me plus their unit roster feels off their tier 2 units feel weaker than the regular kossars you get and the fact that everyone is a hybrid of everything isn t satisfying to me the campaign pacing seems unnecessarily rushed in wh2 you could ignore the main quest and go at your own pace due to being able to send incursions to stop your rivals both leading up to and at the final battle to win thus you could expand and sandbox the way you want to and do the story once you ve built yourself up in this game the campaign seems built around discouraging the total war expansion style of gameplay expanding too fast weakens your empire to chaos gate incursions but turtling and not expanding and fighting enough lets the ai get ahead of you in the quest to get souls of all the warhammer games to cut blood and gore out for a dlc this one is the most egregious you can play as a servant of khorne on maps that have 50ft blood fountains rivers of blood skull mountains nurgle soldiers literally pooping units to death and the debauchery of slaanesh all in the base game already but heaven forbid my units draw a little blood when attacking other units it makes the combat look floaty when you zoom in and instead of getting gristly fantasy action that feels impactful units will fly back and die with 0 feedback seemingly at random it s blatant cut content for the sake of selling it in a dlc some of the ui changes make no sense but luckily most of them are changeable in the settings if you don t like them the only major complaint is the obsession with making everything red i m unable to really at a glance tell the difference between a building i m building and a building i m demolishing because they re both the same hourglass color with one minor ui tweak next to it in terms of graphics the game looks like a weird mesh between the realism of warhammer 2 and the fantasy style of three kingdoms and it doesn t mesh well with the serious tone of the story and campaign doesn t matter to me a lot though since i normally run it on medium graphics anyways but the performance is significantly worse this time around on the same settings as previous titles all in all it s an ok game buggy yes but nothing gamebreaking in my playthroughs but of the three warhammer games it s definitely my least favorite obviously when they add this roster and map to mortal empires most of those grievances will go away because i won t have to play around the chaos gameplay loop or soul fetching quests but other than trying things out and learning how the factions play i don t see myself devoting half the total hours to this game as i did wh2 or wh1
