zero tolerance it would be an understatement if to say they don t tolerate cheaters and i don t mean the obvious hacks like flying or teleporting i have cheat engine installed on my computer for offline games only even when i close out of it their anti cheat detects this and forces the game to close even with the implementation they still banned me i try to go to customer support and let them know they reviewed and said i did cheat when i have never had a history of this and have 75 hours in this game if you want to play this game don t have any cheat programs installed in your computer even if it s for retro games it was a fun game and it was the first battle royal i did dailies for and i normally don t leave reviews but this is the one exception to the rule 6 18 2024 update after 25 tickets 11 days many emails and discord messages i was finally unbanned fact is i only got lucky and was persistent this should never have happened in the first place and i m not the only who was banned unjustly many people who play in internet cafes also faced similar issues the review stays as a reminder for the sweat and tears that were shed
