2018 disclaimer this review is innaccurate and 4 years oldalthough i enjoy this game a lot i can not reccomend this to new players for multiple reasons which will be covered in this review however let me first cover how this game worksas a survivor you team up with 3 others either randoms or as a premade team of friends named swf once in a game aka match survivors will have to do five generators shortened to gens then open the exit gates to escape and live another day in the nightmare of the entity s realmas a killer you host a lobby and have 4 survivors join to start a match once in a match you will have to kill all 4 survivors by crippling them aka downing with your weapon picking them up and putting them on a sacrificial hook you must make sure no survivors escape to please your literal god master the entity 1 toxcicitythis fanbase is extremely toxic securing a kill as a killer referred to as camping and tunneling will get some tasty rep s and comments on your profile just check out mine people are very toxic in endgame chat especially if you are the killer this is one of the main reasons that if you aren t thick skinned you shouldn t buy this game looking back at this in 12 31 2020 funny how nothing has changed though this has reduced greatly over time no more death threats at least 2 killer gameplayyou d think that killers would be the powerful and have control in the game but that s far from true to sum it up the time it takes to complete a generator is very short when compared to how long a chase takes furtherly it takes very long for many killers to move around the map meaning that you often come to a generator and it gets finished in front of your face many weaker killers do not have enough time to catch and kill survivors this all combined makes playing any killer except the hillbilly nurse and hag the three best killers in the game a chore and even as the two best killers you need to spend hundreds of hours mastering them unless you want to be bullied by the survivors the worst thing here is the swf i mentioned before combining the amount of time pallets can waste along with perfectly communicating where you are what perks you are using and what killer you are it s very painful edit this list has now been updated hillbilly got nerfed somewhat hard and nurse as well if i remember correctly nurse hag and spirit are now the best 3 killers and most killer are at least somewhat viable just don t play the very bad ones if you wann have fun 3 survivor gameplayplaying survivor however without swf or the perks i mentioned earlier perks are things you can equip on your character which give you special abilities like 150 faster movement speed for 3 seconds playing survivor is a chore too since the killer has perks which makes finding you easier and since stealth is very hard to pull of because of how maps are designed you have to pallet loop going pallet to pallet to waste as much time as possible while your teammates hopefully do gens if you re not being chased you have to hold down m1 for 80 seconds to complete a generator boring if the killer doesn t give up on you downs you and the exit gates are open then you re basically dead unless you re teammates decide to come for you and have the perk borrowed time until you level up all your survivors to get the perks or play with swf and communication devices like discord the game will not be the most fun edit you now start with your characters perks and finishing the tutorial gives you enough bloodpoints to level up a bit furtherly your teammates will often have 3 braincells unhooking you infront of the killer reffered to as farming is quite common if your teammates can t loop you might have to take the agression yourself so you don t have a 1v1 on your hands or do two gens and hope for hatch game 5 the devsit feels like they don t listen they just nerfed a balanced perk named bbq and chilli which was often used on killers this perk incentivized leaving the hook after you hook a survivor meaning that less people camped so that the game was more fun on both side it feels like they don t play their own game as they ve released multiple trash killers clown legion along with their perks being horrible 6 the legionwowie a new killer the legion guess what he s trash he has a lower base movement speed and his ability forces him to hit a survivor 4 times to down them he has nearly no chase even clown without addons would be better than him his design is generic his special perks are trash it feels like he was extremely rush and instead of buffing him by making a currently meta very good perk work better on him they opted to nerf another weak killer doctor instead by making said meta perk no longer work on him 7 the hatchi ve forgotten to include this in my original review but i might as well add it now after two gens have been done and three survivors have been killed the hatch will spawn and open a survivor can jump into the hatch to escape but while jumping he or she can be grabbed and put onto the killer s shoulder if both sides come to the hatch at the same time or the killer finds it first the killer and survivor will be forced to stare at eachother if they want to win as acting hitting the survivor or jumping in will result in the loss for the side acting this can lead to hatch stand offs lasting between 5 minutes to an hour it s boring and has been a problem since the game started and it still hasn t been fixed this has been fixed in a satisfactory manor and this is no longer an issue8 to sum it upthis game can be very fun if you are playing with friends especially in kyf kill your friends however playing killer without the strongest perks and the best killers is a chore and really unfun unless you re playing with brain dead survivors playing survivor without the strongest perks is okay ish but nothing special due to the ease in survival don t buy it for now but keep a close eye for the next few updates i said this like 6 months ago lmao edit 9 finally re updated the review again removed and added a few points revised others i recommend this game if you have friends to play it with otherwise wait for a sale it is worth it then
