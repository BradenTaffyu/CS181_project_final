2017 don t ever buy this game its highly likely that you would regret it i loved it it was so much fun to play but at some point hackers became a serious problem which apparently couldn t be resolved modders hackers started invading online lobbys and at some point it was so bad you couldn t play in an open session without meeting at least 1 these modders dropped money endless amounts of money the money pool in gta got inflated to an extend that a car that looks like a ramp now costs 4million when i started the best existing car and the car of dreams was at 1million so by making stuff so expensive and not really doing anything about the hacking problem they gave people an insentive to get money dropped because the only way to get this stuff you needed to ask a modder or give up completely on your reallife and use bugs and exploits to get some money the lack of content would be a problem too but its the smallest i can think of you ll have hours of fun in gta even with the existing content if you dont get banned and here we come to the biggest contender for of the year banwaves when i first heard about it i was like wow they finally do something about it maybe after this is in controll they could work on the inflation but no random people get banned and so did my girlfriend i always wanted to play a game which i love with the girl i love but because of the random banning of innocents i my girlfriend and 2 other friends got robbed of that experience i dont have a reason to play this game anymore because the bans are random and the customer service laughs at you because apparently everyone who gets banned deserves it you just have to go through all the other reviews to see the irony in that people with 10 hours of playtime to 1000 hours of playtime get banned for no reason i havent even heard of real modders getting banned dont ever buy this game not even in a sale its likely that you ll get banned or the friend you intend to play with
