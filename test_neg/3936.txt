2019 i m sure rockstar had the best intentions while making this game and singleplayer is good but the multiplayer is basically just a money milking machine for taketwo so many gamemodes and potential all balanced around basically being a frustration simulator everything costs loads of money and making money is nigh impossible on your own you can t even make money by stealing and selling cars is that really what you d call grand theft auto and god help you if you get a motorcycle club or organisation or anything like that because the only way to make money is by joining public sessions full of hackers yes they still dont have that nailed cause they dont care enough as it basically still makes them money and getting all your product destroyed by 9 year olds that never even heard of an age restriction just because it earns them rp to do so which is yet another choice they made to make sure people get so frustrated they just buy shark cards for only a mere 47 euros worth sharkcards you get an oppressor flying motorcycle with explosive machineguns and homing missiles which basically just makes you a god of destruction in this game guess what all the 9 year olds with hacked money are using if i d have to buy it again i m not sure i would i d give about 15 20 euros for the singleplayer story the multiplayer just makes me want to cut whoever s responsible for sharkcards open with sharkcards
