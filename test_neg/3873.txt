2019 you can no longer play gta 5 without an internet connection in order to check that you can run gta 5 in offline mode rockstar now requires that both the game and launcher have internet access every time you start they are obviously preparing for no offline mode in rd2 they want to know when you play it where you play it from what you do in it and for how long rockstar are willing to impose slow excessive drm to ensure they can spy on you they don t seem to realise that steam drm is only tolerable because it doesn t to launch time doesn t interfere with gameplay and obeys offline mode abuse those and suddenly pre steam behaviours become a lot more appealing
