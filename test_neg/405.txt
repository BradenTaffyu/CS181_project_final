2023 a sad unfinished game with no reason to lose access to the originalas a long time fan of counter strike global offensive i ve observed the changes that accompanied the release of counter strike 2 0 with a mix of disappointment and nostalgia rather than feeling like a natural evolution the game seems to have taken a step back leaving it massively diminished compared to its predecessor the removal of what feels like over 60 percent of the content and maps is a decision that has left many loyal players feeling baffled and frustrated those who have been part of the community for years miss the variety that characterized the counter strike experience the reduction in game modes and maps has contributed to a sense of monotony detracting from the diverse and engaging fps experiences the game used to offer the limitations on game modes and maps are particularly perplexing as they seem to undercut the essence of counter strike the game s charm was rooted in the myriad possibilities and unpredictability across various game modes and maps unfortunately the current state of affairs is marred by monotony exacerbated by the prevalence of hackers and a dismal peekers advantage the compromised anti cheat systems are a letdown for players who have invested time and passion into the game the rise of hacking has shifted the once competitive and skill based environment into a less savory space detracting from the integrity of the game counter strike 2 0 in its current state can be described as unpolished the potential for a great game is there but it is overshadowed by poor decisions and neglect it s disheartening to see a beloved game reduced to a source of frustration and disappointment it s clear that there is muchmuch work to be done valve has a responsibility to address these issues and reinvigorate the game ensuring that it lives up to its legacy and provides a positive gaming experience for its dedicated community if they cannot do that then there is no reason to just bring back csgo
