2022 game use to be amazing most fun i ve ever had with my friends i started playing on ps4 and moved over here to pc a few years later i haven t touched this game in over a year now and its not from burnout i crave what this game use to be but i know its not that same game anymore and it never will be they continue to push things that literally no one wants they do not care about their veteran players the game you see now is a sick mockery of what it use to be i m just glad i m not the only one who thinks that for me personally it all started when they started reworking these already amazing maps the old school maps were literally so fun and great but they just had to completely sh tcan them instead of just making new great maps all the new maps suck skins suck camos suck and don t even get me started on the ridiculous operators and their ridiculous abilities screw you ubisoft we had something amazing and you tore it all down for personal gain you re one of the main reasons i have to take prozac we hate you
