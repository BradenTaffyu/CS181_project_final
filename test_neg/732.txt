welcome to valve you love csgo that s good and all but we already got money from you suckers so we gonna proceed on the steps we we had planned for the future alright here we go step 1 take the whole development team that made csgo and tell them to off and focus on a different project and say to the public that you were just tired of working on a game step 2 come out with new name plate for the same game with only some slight changes step 3 find the worst 2 people who never once development a huge game before that volunteers and hire them step 4 bring back bugs from years ago with every new update step 5 never fix the issues with cheaters on the game just simply ban them once if they come back with another paid new account and pay for the skins on our store page then let them stay in the game step 6 watch the money flow in our pockets
