2023 at the launch of call of duty modern warfare 3 i had little to zero intentions of buying the title for a price tag as oblivious as 70 00 usd especially as someone who typically purchases call of duty titles for a specific game mode in this case i would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode i decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for 48 00 the campaign for this year s release was overall subpar in my opinion the previous campaigns for the call of duty franchise had more elements of cinematic game play that truly made moments in the story more vibrant and intriguing to indulge into in addition to the lack of meaningful storytelling i would also have to agree when others and i myself say that the campaign was far too short contributing to the feeling of being shortchanged for the value of the game with a retail price of 70 00 bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when i played the multiplayer modes of the title the mechanics are spectacular as you feel a sensation of freedom being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title call of duty modern warfare ii i do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of skilled based matchmaking sbmm a lot of complaints i hear about video games having sbmm i just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren t sweats it s harder for me to get clips whether it is a content creator small time big time or someone that just wants to show off games like call of duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion especially being an first person shooter fps title in my point of view if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better that should be a motivating factor for you to improve be better it simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance quality my first impressions were thrilling everything was new different levels of zones was in a way intimidating for a solid 10 15 matches it was great to catch on to little things i did not know about the game mode until i learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring being able to level up your weapons in not only multiplayer but also the zombies mode is a great selling point for me as i never have to worry about the feeling of missing out fomo and can simultaneously progress several portions of the game in one however it is important to note that at the current time of writing you can only progress your weapon s 10 levels in one match before you are capped i would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise as yes i understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises zombies but it is something new and a good new a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises zombies i felt that it was a must that include this header for the topic of the game s mechanics and how they work as a lot of the functionality may affect if a certain demographic of players would find this to be a deterrent from their purchase as of writing in modern warfare 3 2023 there are a few changes in addition to how the overall aim and aiming down sights work a lot of the information i will be referencing is contributed by my firsthand experience as well as the points made from this video youtube video warzone why does aiming feel so bad in wz 3 mw3 16 fps games compared views 396 856 link to download our new tgd mobile app thank you all for the support and for whatever reason the game is moving towards a more realistic mil sim like game play which call of duty has never been known for the weapons reticles will never be centered when you aim down sights and will fly everywhere when you strafe jump prone and move your input mouse or right thumb stick i personally would not have much of a problem with this if it was not for the fact that controller players are not affected by this as much as mouse and keyboard players this is the unbalanced aim assist that people reference when they exclaim how excruciatingly unfair it is to play against controller players because i as a mouse and keyboard player myself must skillfully compensate for the little variables and factors to make my aim perfect when on the other hand a controller player has computer generated assistance to not have the same problems as a mouse and keyboard player does the point i am trying to convey here is that it really seems like as the call of duty franchise progresses there is a oblivious message being portrayed that message being more favoritism over controller players vs mouse and keyboard players on top of the fact that the title was retail priced at 70 00 consumers may opt to purchase the vault edition that came with the game for a total of 100 00 i am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise it is clear that activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company built upon greed added bonus also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment sexual assault and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment controller players once again have a oblivious advantage over mouse and keyboard players and i may be biased because i am a mouse and keyboard player myself but if you really stop to think about the amount of accommodations given to controller players it does not add up to the overall equal playing field between the two inputs i would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of 70 00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount the campaign is subpar everything within the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game for a retail price of 30 00 this would have been a reasonable purchase
