2020 i used to love this game it was a lot of fun to play with friends although i can t say i ve had the best experience with it the game is good itself the operators are fun to play and the tactical gameplay was enjoyable but toxicity can get in the way of a fun game experience i haven t gotten into raked enough to truly experience what it s like but whenever i ve played unranked especially in us servers you ll have to put up with getting tk d your team doesn t evey try or you get trash talked nearly every game it s always dragged me away from wanting to do ranked after my 500 hours of playing this game i will say while i ve had some amazing experiences with this game there s certain aspects of the game that keep me from playing it and it s terrible to play solo you re best off playing with friends in casual if you just want to play the game for fun and i ve had a better experience in casual with less toxicity than ranked
