i have been playing this game for 5 years now on microsoft store and just got it on steam not long ago and i cant recommend this game at all the game itself is fine and i absolutely love playing it but the employees and developers do not care for their game at all they dont ban cheaters and when they get enough backlash against it all they do is put an anticheat on it and call it good all i can say is that this company is tyrannical and needs to be held accountable for their actions
