2020 sea of thieves is a game with an overwhelmingly large amount of potential but it doesn t meet what it s shooting for sea of thieves is a genuinely fun game it s easily one of my favorite games of all time but that doesn t mean it s a perfect game and that i can ignore serious issues that have hindered and will continue to hinder my experience sea of thieves suffers from a slew of half baked balance issues game breaking bugs and honestly underwhelming rewards but before i get into the meat as to why i can t recommend this game i must briefly list the goods about this game as there are plenty of them to list here that can make the game worthwhile pros a genuinely amazing game with friends arguably one of the best a flat gear state so new players are equally as equipped as experienced players every form of currency is for cosmetic items only and again they have no effect on gameplay plenty of events that are always fun to do many commendations to complete alongside very fun tall tales combat is incredibly fun and has a high skill ceiling ship combat is one of the most refreshing combat styles i ve had in a game hoarding and selling loot never gets old monthly updates that actually add a good bit of content every update it runs well on a machine as old as mine and is insanely beautiful now that the positives of the game are out of the way i must do my fair part and acknowledge that this game does have big issues that can sour the experience for people which for me has happened time and time again if you can manage to stomach these aspects of the game you may actually come to love sea of thieves as much as i do cons the game has many game breaking bugs that have quite literally broken events such as clipping in skull forts or megs despawning when attacking or flying over my ship the games community is overall pretty toxic and is often overlooked in favor of it being a pirate game which is a poor excuse for bad behaviour new players will have a very hard time learning this game without a guide and will have an even harder time if players focus them due to their new nature the game has incredibly bad hit reg at times sometimes perfectly placed shots won t hit and awful misses will be a hit when you sink an enemy boat they will spawn only a few islands away at best and can indefinitely pursue you with no loss to themselves which is quite miserable the cross platform play is nice if you have friends that play on console but are unfair to console players as pc players have an incredibly large advantage the in game default settings are terrible and the graphics options are lacking and terrible pirate legend is not at all worth getting and athenas is arguably the worst emissary in the game a terrible reward for hitting tier 50 on 3 different merchant factions you will earn so much gold and have absolutely nothing to spend it on which sucks rare has an issue with addressing bugs in this game as i ve experienced bugs that have been reported on the forums over 2 years ago the game has an issue with tabbing out and it takes a year to tab in and out of the game the pirate code in the tavern teaches new players an unrealistic mindset to have in a game about piracy and should be removed the games price tag is quite high the game rarely goes on sale while having predatory microtransactions that are quite expensive yes you don t need to buy them but when they take content that was going to be given to pirate legends like pets and make them micros it s an issue unless you have a premade team the game can be pretty unfun solo slooping takes a lot of effort and experience and playing with randoms makes an uncoordinated experience cosmetic sets are split apart and time gated so for collectors such as myself it can be an issue when you own part of a set while the other part is locked away forever requires an xbox account this is minor honestly just a nit pick the sloop is a hard boat to fight as it has almost every advantage of bigger ships except for speed and firepower the boat is near impossible to sink if at least 1 person on the boat is managing the water and holes as you can simply use the bucket xx trick and throw the water through the window the sloop should be changed slightly to make it easier to fight this has since been nerfed the game requires a large amount of time investment if you re going to want to make any progress in a play session and as a college student this really sucks sometimes with all of these issues it s genuinely hard to recommend this game to anyone even though i absolutely love the game i think if you re ever going to purchase this game you should only do so if you have a crew of friends at your side plenty of free time and if it s on sale as of right now rare has some pretty prevalent issues that need to be worked out before it s in a state of being worth buying at 40 usd i will continue to play this game as i do love it very much and i have many friends at my side while i play but as of right now you should hold off from buying it tldr pretty fun game if you have friends and free time but it can be pretty unfair and stressful at times edit rare has since decided to remove the ability to tweak the engine to get above 90 fov in game which is a massive turn off for me now and further reinforces my point on why i can t possibly recommend this game gimping players ability to not get motion sick when playing a game they enjoy purely for balance reasons is insane higher fov does not effect the pvp aspect of the game in any way rare has once again lowered the quality of sea of thieves by introducing nonsensical balance changes to the game that only serve to cater to the console side of their player base
