2018 online play brokenlike many others i was banned from online play due to a faulty anticheat system that rockstar has denied accountability for and has failed to repair multiple months after its issues had first been brought to their attention considering the major scope of this issue and its consequences rockstar s public response has been incredibly irresponsible and incompetent auto denying ban appeals and failing to formally address the cause of the issue hopefully this issue will be erradicated in the near future and we many who have been affected can again enjoy the online features of this fantastic product i wish rockstar the best in resolving these issues
