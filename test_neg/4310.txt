2021 755 hours in and i love this game the gameplay is top tier and after you get through the difficulty of learning the in game systems it has so much depth and allows for so much creativity however i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to potential new players the on boarding experience while improved over the years is still pretty bad they teach you the gameplay well enough but then throw you into a frankenstein s monster of systems that they did not put nearly enough effort into explaining there are also so many vestigial systems as a new player you might find yourself pouring in time to understand one of these bastardized systems to only to find out that it s out dated and been unsupported for years looking at you archwings among other things they really could stand to invest some time and money into improving the onboarding experience for new players clean up remove unused systems optimize the current ones and create worthwhile tutorials for them new content is great for us who have played for hundreds of hours but i feel like they would do themselves more good if they spent some extra time and money on the early game there is a reason only 40 of players have gotten to the 2 hour mark of this game and this is the biggest reason why i wish this was a game i could recommend to not only others on steam but to my friend group as it stands now i cannot
