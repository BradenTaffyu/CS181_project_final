2020 grand theft auto 5 part shooter part open world with lots of side activities and with a story to tell the game focuses on three characters franklin who s trying to make a name for himself in the town michael a retired criminal with short temper and trevor his old heisting mate with downright psychopathic tendencies the main story is about how they meet up and end up as partners in a lot of let s just say illegal operations which is to be expected given this is gta graphically you can tell this is more than a couple years old i would say it aged relatively well you can see most of the details on objects or especially characters with good draw distance and maybe some textures being kinda blurry overall it s the typical gta experience go through story missions do side activities like races or parachuting or just go on the good ol rampage with rocket launchers and miniguns the game plays primarily like a cover shooter with most headshots being instantly lethal and regenerating health up to a certain point what makes the game a bit more interesting than an average cover shooter is characters special abilities well a little bit more interesting as they re not particularly special franklin gets slow mo superdriving michael has bullet time when shooting and trevor well let s just say he goes nuts tanks bullets like they re nothing and the ones he fires tend to explode enemy body parts rather violently besides that you can use the in game money you earn to buy properties whether for storing vehicles or making more money despite how solid singleplayer is it ain t making up for how horrible online is the general gist of online is pretty obvious do stuff with friends that you would normally do by yourself in this type of game you can also play various multiplayer activities like pvp shootouts battle royale or races to earn cash and experience to level up and unlock buy more stuff and here s actually the first flaw of the thing you need amounts close to a million to buy just one major property than isn t a simple apartment for you to stay in or a single vehicle more expensive weaponized vehicles have a base price of 3 4 milion with even more if you wanna customize them sometimes requiring another one or two purchases worth a seven digit figure each just to be able to even fully customize them in the first place and a lot of the stuff you buy is mostly just so you can have an easier time making more money the most recent piece of content casino heist will likely get you and your buddies a bit over half a milion per head after about two hours worth of setup and running the heist itself if split evenly it takes quite a lot of grinding especially with no income to even be able to afford one major thing well that or what rockstar wants you to do buy shark cards another major problem is how easy it is to grief in online everyone who played it knows the flying terror made of highly concentrated bullcrap the oppresor mk2 a jet powered bike with homing rockets countermeasures to avoid enemy firepower tiny size fairly high speed and in contrast with all the other aircraft the ability to be used at almost full effectiveness by potatoes it s the griefer s favorite tool and it makes the job extremely easy it s hard to really get anything done when every session you re guaranteed to have at least one of these guys blowing hundreds of thousands of in game currency worth of stuff you re trying to sell it does have counters given it s made out of paper and doesn t protect its user from enemy bullets but when you re new and don t own anything or you re stuck driving a slow ass garbage truck that s basically a sitting duck kiss your potential money goodbye of course it s to the benefit of rockstar making life hell for people trying to earn money just drives up shark card sales which is their bottom line also their anti cheat is basically nonexistant it s extremely easy to use some kind of modding overlay to do all kinds of crazy stuff so cheaters are extremely common in this game if you re lucky they will at most meme on you while being rather harmless at worst make everything explode in the world nuke the entire session from orbit or force crash your game the majority of heist prep objectives usually boil down to three things getting something from point a to point b losing cops it won t let you actually finish much if you re on the radar or getting killed over and over with one shots to the head until you can actually get whatever you wanna get done well done in heists themselves you have usually a spare life on normal and none on hard which has 25 higher payout anybody dying when there are no lives remaining means automatic failure and restart from the last checkpoint which is usually start of the actual activity after driving there or if the game s feeling merciful the halfway point in general it frequently feels like it jumps from sleep inducing driving to extremely frustrating cycle of dying and respawning over and over again with hardly anything in between and on a technical level online s one giant amusing glitch at best a complete and utter joke at worst it takes between 5 10 minutes just to join an online session loading time wise on start up still a few minutes when you re switching sessions afterwards besides that there are tons and tons of bugs so i m just going list the ones i personally experienced constant issues with joining any friends sessions or their heists inability to join them outright due to having to complete the tutorial first this being after i have already joined them that session meaning it s definitely completed already otherwise it wouldn t let me do that in the first place textures just straight up disappearing to reveal the void beneath the city constant desync issues during heists which cause illogical things like cameras surveiling walls or doing 360 turn arounds purchasing clothes only for them to be magically un purchased next time you check on them on multiple occassions heist cuts resetting to default where the host takes lion s share of the cash and everyone else is left with piddling amounts on two occassions and softlocking the game while doing something as simple as buying ammo i have absolutely no idea how this mess of a game can be rockstar s cash cow unless their idea of making money is to keep it in a laughable state to frustrate the players to the point of buying shark cards in order to skip the dysfunctional grind that s both the only logical solution to it and also something that makes me wonder just how much longer this industry or humanity itself for that matter can even function if this is what people are actually spending money on en masse so overall my recommendation is no just due to how insultingly poor online is since i m judging the whole package here however if you re not interested in online it s a fairly decent and sometimes good game to have a few tens of hours worth of fun with even if it s nothing special in which case i would say pick it up on a sale
