2022 tldr i pre ordered three copies of this game for myself and two friends both myself and my friend have systems that exceed the recommended requirements both of us have had a 50 fps drop using the same settings in tww3 vs 2 and it is not apparent why this is after installing the nvidia game ready drivers and following forum suggestions i question why this game is 79 99 and whether it was adequately optimized tested further there are many bugs ranging from hilarious to game mechanic breaking i cannot therefore recommend it in its current state ca broke my trust once with abruptly ending three kingdoms and leaving it unfinished now they have the audacity to charge full price for a half finished game i am tired of pre ordering from game companies and getting unfinished product the warhammer team is supposed to be better than that i guess not full review it is finally here after the long wait the end of a trilogy sadly the game runs exceptionally poorly what were the devs thinking i was getting 70 fps on ultra 1080p on tww2 with tww3 i get barely above 30 fps with frame skipping below that from time to time this is even with the game ready drivers going through forums even individuals with the latest and greatest hardware also have problems based on reviews i expected a 20 decrease in performance but instead now have a 50 decrease this makes the game unplayable i question how much effort ca put into optimization in essence the devs in my opinion need to step up and fix the performance issues looking at forums i am not the only one having issues and i have no problems with any other total war or other games bug wise the game gave me two achievements when i only watched the intro videos that was strange there are issues with pathfinding during city battles where the ai will go in circles during city fights this is comical in some cases but it means you have no meaningful opposition the last bug i picked up is that one of the research items for slaanesh causes you not to be able to vassalize factions this breaks an integral mechanic in the game if you change any graphics settings your cursor wont work if you click on the ui you have to quit the game to do so the only way to do that is to slightly click outside of the ui button to quit in conclusion even if you are a fan of the warhammer universe save some money and buy it later the game feels half finished and is significantly overpriced i am willing to change my review if things get fixed but currently i can t play the game i bought and neither can my friend
