2020 game is great but the random server changing is ruining the game game doesn t warn you about the server change when you play an event for an hour and finally get your loot the game can change the server you re playing and everything you gathered is lost because game didn t give you any time to carry them into your ship sometimes you see bunch of loot in the sea or sink another ship but you can t take their loot because they disappear after the server change this happened to me couple of times basicly you waste your hours for nothing let us know atleast 10 minutes ago when the server is going to change it shouldn t be that hard or when the server is going to change it should be delayed for atleast 10 15 minutes automaticly and the game should warn you about that other than that there are really low variety of characters most of the skins are awful and you don t know what to buy because everything looks bad galleons are really slow even though they have 3 sails cheaters or screaming childs and game gets repetitive but none of them bothered me as much as the random server changes i have no idea how they couldn t think of fixing this overr years but i won t change my review until they do
