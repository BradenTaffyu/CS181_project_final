2022 product received for free this review is for gta v online not the singleplayer gta v gta v s singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience gta v online has such an amazing groundwork a beautiful map tons of content and a plethora of things to do all of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game while many people would argue that there aren t that many of them or that they don t affect the experience both of these statements are just untrue from my experience almost every public lobby has at least 1 2 modders in it these modders and the amount they can do outside the game s boundaries is absolutely unacceptable they can spawn unobtainable vehicles become invincible fly explode the entire map teleport become npcs such as animals lock you into a cage crash your game instantly and many other things if this wasn t enough they can violate your privacy they can force you to type things into chat and even see your ip address it s questionable if having a vpn will help this though many have said that it definitely will and i strongly advise using one if you do happen to be playing your first thought would be to report these people to rockstar correct well modders get alerts when you send a report through the game which allows them to delete them before they even reach rockstar that s right you can t even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience your rockstar account and your real world well being on top of all this rockstar as a company is just completely awful they have taken most customer support down for the game so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof however they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so hilariously my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset all of the 95 4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder something out of my control and completely without my consent i had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my gta or social club account before this this game is outdated not supported by the developers and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk do not buy this game for the online
