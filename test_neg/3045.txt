2017 i use to love this game even have 3 copies xbox360 xbox one and pc but rocksatr no longer gives a about their customers that and or they haven t kept up with their customer support i have been temparily banned due to having sweet fx graphic mod once and again due to not removing a single dll file that i forgot about even after reaching out to them 5 times and even a phone call they told me it ll be fine and the ban would be lifted shortly sadly it didn t so i waited the last ban i received was permanent all due to being put into a server with a user that teleported player to him froze them mass spamed props and money on them till it crashed my game i even reported this incident to rockstar and the next day received a permanent ban not a single email and no repsonse were given to me just the same computer response and even with all that i was close to rebuying the game just so i could play with my friends again but then i hear that modders aren t welcome even the ones that are simply trying to make the game better and more fun for free so i guess with that said this is where i say you rockstar and take two on behalf of the modding community i hope your game dies and no one wishes to make custom content for it to keep it a float
