2018 i like this game and my friends like this game despite it being more and more of a horde shooter this is less of a don t play this game and more of a you should probably know this before you play the game kind of review do not trade or deal in platinum unless you are prepared to get banned if someone steals platinum and it is traded to your account instead of charging the person who stole the platinum they will charge whoever owns that platinum if you go to support and ask why you are being charged money for someone elses crime they will tell you that it s your fault for using thier in game trading system and they will just take the money from the account who owns it despite who stole it the biggest issue is that when they substract their lost plat from the system even when they know and i mean they litterally admitted that they knew my friend hadn t stole it and they had indeed traced it to the source they still banned him let me repeat they know where the stolen plat came from and still choose to punish the person who they knew hadn t stolen it in order to play the game he had to contact customer support and pay for the stolen plat meaning not only do they take the plat and ban you but you now have to pay for someone elses theft i could have the smallest amount of understanding if they just took the plat they don t want to wreck the in game economy but to make you pay for stolen plat when they admitted they knew he hadn t stolen it imagine if someone sold you a car they stole and then instead of just taking the car the police took the car asked you to pay for it and charged you with theft despite knowing who stole it that s what de is doing furthermore my friend had spent the plat buying deco for the dojo and effectavly that plat was already removed from the game since he gave it to de for the decorations so there was 0 chance of it affecting the in game economy if all this wasn t enough they also suspend you from the forums so you can t say anything about it and there s no way to know how often this happens since there aren t threads about it since they ban you this honestly seems like they are running a scam they care more about their cost than they do about their players which it pretty typical for de lets be honest but i ve never seen it to this extent i m sure it s not an real scam but they just handle it so poorly it seems like that now as a small disclaimer i have friends who have never run into this problem this particular friend was mr 15 with some 800 hours in the game and has traded probably close to 100k of plat around mostly since all he usually does is farm prime parts and hunt eidolons so he really raked the plat in if you hardly ever trade you ll likely be safe but there s always that chance and de handles it like a limp noodle so if you play this game do not go anywhere near the real money currency unless you want to risk getting fined and have to pay for someone s crime edit since some people aren t aware stealing plat happens when someone used a faulty credit card then quickly trades the plat away makes many many accounts and funnels the starting plat to an account some form of hacking the game itself there s probably other ways but these are the ones i ve heard about
