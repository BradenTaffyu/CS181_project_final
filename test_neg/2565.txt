i ve played this game for 5 years since launch i had a prior account that was hacked 2 years back it s had its ups and downs but man it s gotten to a point the game is so intolerable to play for its many issues that i ve had to uninstall the matches are approximately fixed either by the game or by players who are cheating cheating hacking smurfing is so rampant in this game that it is unplayable just on that front alone however the game itself fixes each match by dynamically adjusting variables throughout the match to try to achieve a desired outcome respawn wants to control the distribution of wins to losses per player to maximize player retention which is of course manipulative such variables include team stacking loot generation dive speed target tracking bullet strafing hit registration damage count mobility even ping rate lord knows what i m missing when you combine all of that along with the cheaters afk bots in mixtape mode and smurfers this game supremely sucks i hate that i m even saying this as a loyal 5 year apex player but this game is steaming hot garbage and i cannot defend it or even try to play it any longer it is absolutely clear without a shadow of doubt that these games are approximately fixed and the knowledge of that ruins any derived enjoyment from the game respawn you were close to something great but you had to ruin it i m happily uninstalling this game for good goodbye
