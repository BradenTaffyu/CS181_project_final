2015 update rockstar and take two interactive have now officially established themselves as fundamental anti consumers v is one of the most profound and mind numbing examples on how you can take the most recognized video game franchise on earth and turn it into a cancerous clusterf ck of hideously moronic design decisions that have no equal in terms of the sheer stupidity and broken functionality that currently plagues this depressingly messed up title as the faults with this game are numerous and require their own individual attention i am simply going to list them one by one while providing proof of their existence 1 online functionality putting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 1 6 3 minutes for people with top tier gaming pc s that have ssd s the state of the gta servers as of right now are a horrendous mess as anyone that played the game on console or even watched videos of others doing so for more than 3 hours can attest to the problems from there has not been dealt with for the pc version disconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after time outs after server overloads rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers even after delaying the pc release a multiple times for several months and perhaps more importantly giving out fat bonuses to people who pre order weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned it is however made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with zero flexibility go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby play 95 of the mission and have someone disconnect mission cancelled lobby closed down create a new game manually and wait for players to re join to start at square 1 again let someone join mid game to replace him pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin create an ai partner to take his place nope back to the 2 minute loading screens with you over and over and over again youtube video gta v pc vs xb1 loading times views 10 489 follow me link link link i livestream everyday follow me on my twitch tv channel 2 system functionality memory leaks physics glitches that causes crashes black screens fps spikes blue screens graphic driver crashes and cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated gpu s first before checking for any external ones gta v has them all and it is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be and i quote as polished as possible cheaters on both offline and online the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down youtube video gta online this is a cheater views 15 484 also contains me getting rid of the money he dropped on me because no thanks watch live at due to the manner that rockstar handles hackers by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters they can cause massive amounts of havoc most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game the most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam as seen in the video the hacker spammed ufo s and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops the much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways be it being dropped on the street have someone get mugged spend it on cars other items and re sell give them away the list goes on and most of these things rockstar can t reliably keep record of and this isn t even where the issues stop either there are also other more logistical things to keep track of for example they have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the non offending players even then hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate counter measures to deal with these situations 4 system design if you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game it has to be without the shadow of a doubt the bad sport system how does it work it bans you from the regular multiplayer including private sessions with your friends separating you from everyone else if you blow up other player s cars leave online games early or simply get reports sounds like a necessary thing on paper with gta being what it is but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play online a defend yourself from someone trying to drive by you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade you re a bad sport b stay afk in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result you re a bad sport c have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to gta v s notorious memory leak you re a bad sport d own a couple of guys in fair death matches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in gta v and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever you re a bad sport i thought this was a beta thing at first perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console but one faithful day when i just finished a mission and was outside my apartment fiddling with my settings a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an smg i pull out a sticky bomb slap it onto his windshield drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me boom he dies along with his armored kuruma which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns and you have been flagged as a bad sport bye bye playing with friends bye bye actual multiplayer as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another account plays offline bye bye gta online as a whole the first ban you ll get will be 2 3 days 48 72 hours that cannot be reduced used to be possible by getting awards etc not anymore next one will be weeks then months then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one the timer can be extended if you continue being a bad sport by blowing up people s cars and it will very frequently get stuck as well sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs missions or activities it is one of the most hated functions of gta v online and rockstar does absolutely nothing about it it is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing and i quote here doing unsanctioned mayhem the problem here is that there is no system or detection method in place to even remotely determine if a certain mayhem was sanctioned or not in the game now rockstar have also recently broken the game even further with fps killing patches just ugh
