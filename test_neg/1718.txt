2023 so i am just here to point out that ca has yet to successfully launch a dlc without introducing a host of new bugs the launch and almost every patch since have been slow and bug riddled the last dlc added an entirely new race chaos dwarfs was mostly just reskins of existing units from other rosters same animations same hitboxes etc that dlc was not worth 25 this dlc adds 3 new legendary lords and a few new units for 25 at a certain point we as consumers have got to start saying no to this type of behavior i know i will not be paying 25 units for what will almost certainly be another buggy mess
