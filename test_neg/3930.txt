2017 i played gta v since shortly after its release i bought it on ps3 ps4 and i bought it on pc just recently just because of the modabillity i already beat the story mode on ps3 and 4 so whats the point of me playing it on pc any more they pretty much modding the single player hasn t had any new additions in 4 years and the multiplayer has just turned into a grinding charlie foxtrot for people with a lot of time to do mission after mission and the people who spend hundreds on fake cash just to get the newest bike club enterprise or military arms buisness and each getting exceedingly more expensive also if you look at the vehicles in the game with each update the vehicles when from in vanilla being like 200 00 for a nice sporty super car to spending probably millions just trying to get the car like in the gunrunning dlc having to spend up to 2 5 million just to have a chance to buy the new cars
