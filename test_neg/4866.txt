2022 i won t talk about the easily 100 collective crashes my party of six had on launch night because i presume they ll get fixed so i ll start with the multiplayer the moment to moment gameplay is actually very fun and the gunplay feels amazing you just won t get to experience it your guns require 31 bullets and a permission slip to kill someone the exact same gun will delete you from existence with no time to respond the endless uavs that are unencumbered by perks like ghost unlocks at level 52 and doesn t enable until over halfway through a match mean that the enemy always knows where you are the weapon balance is all over the place the entire teams of people we encountered using a one shot kill bolt action rifle without a scope that has a faster fire rate than the any smg and will have you dead before you can even get your gun up certainly showcased the imbalance and while that all is happening to you you have to navigate the most unnecessarily complex unintuitive and inefficient ui of game i ve played in a long time that you can only use in a match or else it crashes the result of a drunken game of darts i presume which is surprising since there are 20 cod games with perfectly functional uis it could have learned from like maybe the previous modern warfare which leads me to the campaign mw19 had one of the most popular campaigns ever and was lauded as a true innovation in an otherwise stale formula excited to see how they follow that up you guessed it drunken game of darts the story at its core is nonsenses i mean that it literally makes no sense nothing any of the characters do is logical what about the slow paced gritty feel of missions like clean house and wolf s den from mw19 don t expect that here there s nothing of the sort maybe you want action packed sequences like the original mw2 well rest assured those are awful too maybe you like gimmicks such as ac 130 missions stealth missions or everyone s favorite from mw19 using a camera to direct someone else all fun all overstay their welcome significantly i played it on regular as i do all cod campaigns one my first play through and it was hard way harder than any other campaign at this difficulty i died in one or two shots a lot then i switched to recruit and nothing changed except the endless hordes of armored enemies instead of taking twelve shots to the head to kill they took eleven want to play a survival crafting game no well strap in because you ve got about an hour and a half of that for some reason the entire thing was a slog and there was no payoff it didn t follow up on the innovations of mw19 it reduced itself to the comforts of mediocrity i wouldn t recommend this game to anyone for the price p s ghost is a total goober
