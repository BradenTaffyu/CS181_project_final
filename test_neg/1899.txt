an update on 08 15 2024 involving cross server content sharing allowed some players to receive virtual currency refunds this was communicated via media posts on 08 17 2024 players received in games messages notifying them of a bug which caused an overage of their refund we were then told to pay for the difference caused by this bug with real currency this bug is not mentioned in any fixes or bug reports released there is evidence to show this developer has done similar scammy behavior in a lord of the rings and a harry potter game there has been no statement or rectifying of this situation by the developer and the customer service is a bot which no longer receives messages if you download this free game please read the tos and i highly recommend not giving them any money
