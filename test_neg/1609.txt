2023 this is tale of modern gaming developers and publishers taking a beautifully well done game clearly the product of equal parts passion and skill and slowly choking the promise and life out of it through corporate greed i m not surprised it is everywhere today not just in gaming but what is so fascinating to me is that this same greed that is killing companies the world over could be sated by a few good consumer focused decisions they could with a little hard work have their cake and eat it too i know what is happening the business side of the company made the determination that raising prices and reducing content ignoring bugs and focusing on new content is the most profitable and efficient method of doing business less work more money after all the company needs profit to survive but this model of thinking is grossly short sighted i would ask the stakeholders of the company the following question which is preferred a 100 increase in profits in the next fiscal year from wh3 but due to horrific understanding of the consumer base the game dies on the vine and the player count and population of consumers of future content decreases to the point where it is no longer viable to continue supporting the game within two years or a slow increase of 10 profit per quarter over the next 5 fiscal years shoring up a rock solid foundation of consumers who will loyally purchase every release of content for the entire life cycle of the game additionally the community relations ensure that the next game in the franchise is eagerly anticipated and pre ordered continuing to grow the company exponentially everyone is picking the first option and not even considering the second even though long term that would be the most profitable decision and the most welcomed by the consumer the problem is that the business side of the company does not understand how the money is made you do not succeed in business by spitting in the face of the customers who have spend hundreds of dollars on your products in the name of quarterly earnings if you do that you may not survive financially to see another quarter you succeed by doubling down on the things which made you successful in the first place attention to detail understanding your community and communicating openly with them and working tirelessly within your own company to produce a culture of full spectrum consumer focused effort rather than deadline driven content generation read bug fixes community engagement media and then quality dlc in equal measure rather than the current high price low content dlc rush it is a circle of growth the consumer sees what they want to see the consumer spends their money on the products the company produces the money is used to payroll the employees increase the wealth of the stake holders and grow the company to produce more content in the same vein of what the consumer wants to see and so on and so forth but enough of my own analysis if anyone from the company is reading this i ll provide you some data points and you can do your own analysis i won t draw you any conclusions i won t tell you why i stopped playing but i ll tell you a little about what matters most to you what i bought from the company and when exactly i stopped playing i have purchased every single item in the total war warhammer franchise except the shadows of change dlc most i purchased at full price many i pre ordered as the time of this review i had 86 9 hours on record in whiii i had 542 6 hours in wh2 i own every single total war title in the franchise except thrones of britannia troy and pharaoh i stopped playing whiii when i noticed that the animations for the witch hunter and free company militia they share the same animation set was completely broken this was a year ago now simply put their mouths do not open or move their pistols were floating magically from their belts to their hands when swapping from idles to attacks and eventually their swords were invisible despite being reported by multiple users on both steam and the forums it was never even added to the known issues list eventually a low effort fix was pushed to bring the swords back and to shove the pistols into the off hand of the model but to this very day the grip of the pistol is horribly clipped into the thumb of the hand and nothing was done to address their broken mouth rig i purchased the forge of the chaos dwarfs but never played because the aforementioned bug wasn t addressed and once i had noticed my favorite hero unit from my favorite faction was broken it became too frustrating to ignore i did not purchase shadows of change so there you go analyze away why might i have stopped playing could there by a linkage between terrible community relations and profit could seemingly minor cosmetic bugs really cause someone to stop playing could ignoring issues like that despite multiple reports and video evidence create a perception of not caring about the player base so powerful it drives decisions to purchase future content could it be after all this time the little things which create success could this really be what kills a multi million dollar franchise there are thousands of other players just like me if you can get my money i think everyone wins you included i wish you nothing but the best i m rooting for you guys
