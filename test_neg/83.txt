don t trust the benchmark be it the tool or the in game one if you have a weak pc the game suffers significant framedrops and stutters starting with the final boss of the first level which could make you overdue for a refund update after nearly another 20 hours after got kicked back by steam refund policy i found more means to improve performance and beat the first two levels i must say i m deeply impressed with the artworks of this game true works of art the stutters clearly centered upon various effects are said to be a nasty quirk of early ue5 engine after some discussion i faced them again with the white dragon on chapter 3 this time even heavier when it starts casting lightnings however its not unmanageable as long as you use spells to lock it out of using them and the rolls in this game have a very long range and much more invincible frames even compared to dark souls 3 so its okay still i ll leave this here as negative as a fare warning performance on low end pc only becomes acceptable with a lot of downgrading to real resolution and frame generation that comes with the algorithm to fake it pixelating effects and everything in motions which is everywhere in a fast paced arpg so much that it often hurts the eyes evident with the floating sands on chapter 2 overall getting worse graphics than last gen with worse frames and the quirks of ue5 can make thing laughable at times but i guess that s just how corpos force people to buy new hardware now a days
