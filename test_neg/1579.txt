2023 what is the current status of tww iii 3 0 quite simple to describe shiny on the outside and rotten to the core but you have to take a closer look to see it which apparently not many are capable of to be honest i have no problem with the price for me it s about something completely different for more than 5 months the numerous bugs haven t really changed to the better at all in just under 5 hours with the new patch i ve seen the same problems even worsened in some cases especially in sieges still invisible enemies the ai with completely stupid deployment in cities ungrim ironfists journeys end still doesn t work waaagh of orc ai factions in battles still not working pathfinding in sieges still incredibly bad still also it seems the performance on the campaign map has worsened again movement of the vampirates seems buggy also the rites of the vampirates frigg i don t want to list everything the dlc looks really good and great but if you put more resources into new stuff like the intel thing instead of fixing the old and known problems bugs then i don t see the point in buying the dlc in fact i won t be buying any more dlc until something improves in terms of the endless bugs in my case the new stuff is not relevant right now i encourage everyone here to reconsider their buying habits for god s sake stop pre ordering everything that s one of the reasons why the quality is getting worse every year ca get your act together or this will be an even bigger than it already is as long as nothing changes i will not recommend the game edit as of today 08 17 2023 nothing has fundamentally changed and today s official statement from ca i guess i ll wait for the new patch 4 0 before updating the review
