so i have spent some more time in the game feelings are still mixed unreal engine 5 is really holding this game up low effort character designs all the female bodies are the same with some small changes all of the character animations are exactly the same map design is meh at best they took the time to put random cubes on some tile sets but they can t even make the people in albion have work spaces that reflect normal everyone is standing 24 7 with not a chair in sight the ingame shop is just a scam you can buy bunny and freyna even though you are given both of them in the first couple hours of the game anyways ultimate descendants cost aaa game pricing and you get nothing extra at least with warframe you get in game currency when you buy a prime pack gameplay is basic and there is nothing of actual value in the story just skip through everything the amount of useless and annoying animations when researching items is rude their anti cheat actively goes through your browser data and then they sell that data to brokers so be sure to lock up your browser data before launching this game edit so with almost 400 hours into the game now from when i mostly played the test phases to barely launched nexon has shown they are willing to listen kind of every update has been a joke not sure if they are just acting dumb with the launches of each update and then make drastic sweeping changes shortly after to give some sort of semblance that they are listening or if they are just incompetent it is not as ridiculous to farm most items but getting the materials to open is a chore and then you have to also farm more materials just to open them at reactors is just an unnecessary time gate they have changed it so now you only have to farm shards 1 1 for each material that you need to open it just still seems unnecessary
