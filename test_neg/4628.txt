2017 let me tell you why i do not recommend playing wf if you re looking to game seriously i started playing warframe in 2013 it was utter tbh and in 2017 they have improved soooo much i m honestly really impressed with de the quests are awesome gameplay is fun in the beginning and you can earn plat easily with a bit of farm here is what s bad there is no endgame people have always come with the excuse fashionframe is endgame but honestly even de mentioned that the endgame in warframe is a huge problem they released trials which no one gives a single about basically when you get mastery rank 23 through lvl weps and warframes there is literally the same things to do as in rank 1 so pros fun gameplay in the beginning great quests earn in game cash easily great optimazation well updatedcon repetitive gameplay grinding no end game feels unfullfilling
