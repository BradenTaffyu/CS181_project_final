2020 this game is great if you play zombies and custom zombies with friends however the price of the game is outrageous 44 for this old game is just robbery the only way i would of said its a fair price is if it gave all the dlcs like how cod4 gave them until they amend the price i dont recommend anyone to buy this game unless purchased elsewhere edit as of writing this theres another issue where you cannot get into a multiplayer match it will load and make you think they are putting you in the game but then will be booted back to the lobby screen this happens everytime i try to go multiplayer i have seen this happen to many others if your someone who was looking forward to playing the mp do not even bother as of 2021 the issue still persists and i dont expect it to ever be fixed
