2023 creative assembly i ve been playing total war since the very first shogun back when i was a child i m in my 30 s now and i ve stuck to the total war franchise because it has in general been a highly enjoyable experience the total warhammer series is an achievement and you should be proud of that but i can t recommend any ca products anymore not even alien isolation your boasting of a new office and profits while complaining about cost increases comes off as entirely disingenuous and your price hike for shadows of change vs its content is just not worth the money bear in mind my family s costs have also gone up food prices in the eu still keep rising despite inflation going down so how is it that your 800 employee company dedicates only a small team about the same size as the entire company i work for to what is essentially its flagship franchise and crowning achievement why is it that major bugs that the community was able to fix easily are still not fixed by you i don t begrudge the individual workers but i do begrudge your entire damn executive management for this gargantuan mess your employees are underpaid and overworked if you want to branch out to other genres fine there s nothing wrong with that until it starts to negatively affect something otherwise so close to being the best strategy experience i ve ever had like seriously do you just not want people to buy your products anymore do you want us to warn people off your company s products completely right now if anyone i knew asked me about total war or any of your other games i d just tell them to not bother and give better companies their hard earned cash lastly this is unlikely to ever make it to anyone high up but mr bartholomew you suck your statement sucked your attitude sucks get the out regards a total war fan
