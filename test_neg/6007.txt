2022 alternative titles bugs by daylight new chapters by daylight hackers by daylight devs in a nutshell we won t implement that because it is too much work we won t implement that because too many code changes punishing people on criticising their game changing numbers of perks add ons that nobody gives a about hockey goals kills skills happy bubba noises 100 of we have done a pretty good job so far honestly at this point you shouldn t even feel bad if you think a player is hacking because subtle hackers are just increasing by the day hell go on yt and you will find many videos of people hacking and they just keep increasing people made a discussion on their forum about a recent glitch where players got wall hack on using two perks instead of doing something about the glitch the devs deleted these discussions dowsey even made a video on it highly recommend not giving them money to just shove more chapters in our face instead of working on fixing their game first its sad that this needs to be the approach to make them listen and respect their community devs with a bad attitude developing a game in their bugs maybe it will all be resolved by nerfing pig idk
