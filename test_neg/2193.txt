2023 it s alright enough almost any game is good fun when you have friends to play with theres only like 6 game modes so it gets a bit repetitive not of a fan of micro transactions in a game i already paid for dont see myself playing this game for more than a few days until it just becomes like fall guys when you get the sudden urge to play with some friends and then get over it not super worth the money kind of scammy i d wait for a sale at the least mixed feelings
