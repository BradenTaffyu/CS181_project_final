2023 the ai is not fun all it does is attack you with overwhelming odds you ll never fight a winnable defensive battle without absolutely cheesing the ai and it constantly runs from every fight it s not favored in the reason ai gets insane bonuses to combat and economy is so we can have a challenging and fun experience with ai running multiple stacks and stronger units if it uses that to abuse information the player doesn t see fov to attack undefended settlements and then further starve them out until there s no chance of victory if it runs from every fight not in their favor what s the point it s ok if the ai occasionally does this that would make it look smarter but it s so bad ca had to remove small settlement siege battles because the game was boring and the ai refused to fight running around in ai s territory unless the ai had a overwhelming advantage i ve never seen it come and try and stop my army on the field
