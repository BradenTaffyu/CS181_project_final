been playing tww for a while now got like 3000 hrs on tw2 and i ve got to say since the release of tw3 its been a bumpy road with pretty much every decision ca made being focused on anti fun and playing the game the way they want you to however the thrones of decay brought a breath of fresh air to the game with actually interesting new ll s and mechanics but unfortunately as we are learning more and more recently it seems these good changes were actually unintended as ca has come rushing in to save the day with patch 5 1 removing a huge amount of fun from the game such as trait nerfs or straight up removals and worst of all some of these nerfs aren t even to the new introduced content such as the huge nerfs to vlad and malus who have been around for years vlad all the way back in tw1 and malus was released in tw2 back in 2019 these 2 characters have served as regional powerhouses in their respective areas and have provided some much need challenge to the early game especially since in tw3 campaign is pretty much over after the first 30 turns these massive changes to the single player experience in a mainly single player focused game truly show that ca actually has no clue how any of their fans actually feel about the franchise and they are actively trying to remove difficulty even to the hardest difficulties to make the game more beginner friendly as they seem to only care about new players ca is truly showing us now where their priorities are and that is getting as many people as possible to buy the game dlc and they have absolutely zero interest in long time retention of players tw3 was originally going to be a like 10 year life cycle with how well tw2 did and after soc and the most recent patch i would be very surprised if they are still supporting this game in 2 years time tl dr game has been progressively getting worse over the last few years everytime something good is added ca turns around and patches it out saying stop that no fun allowed here these days people enjoy these games not because of ca s updates but in spite of them
