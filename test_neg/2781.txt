2018 product received for free rant time tldr you can get banned at random without any chance of appeal and rockstar s support is garbage but now backstory time on about 3 23 18 thousands of accounts were randomly banned i m not saying all of them were innocent but at least a vocal majority certainly are and as of writing this 4 5 18 we still haven t gotten any sort of proper response that isn t some generic copy paste nonsence this new system appears to have been targeting cheaters but happens to label seeming randomly people as cheaters but you wanna know what will likely come of wiping the progress of some thousand people s charaters more cheaters because who realisticly is going to come back after a month having lost some hundreds in some case thousands of hours of legit grinding thinking well let s do that all over again and don t even get me started on their support policies if you even mention the word ban your support ticket is thrown directly into the trash and given a generic bans are triggered by a number of things and all bans are final like they give this anti cheat so much credit that it can do no wrong in their eyes and you re placing a losing bet if you think they will admit any sort of failure on their end on top of all this if you somehow get a real responce from someone they can t won t tell you why you were even banned this is just plain stupid on many levels you re just supposted to know what you did wrong and not do it again this is especially when one of the listed reasons for a ban is disrupting play that s so incredibly vague they could ban you for just about anything under that label if they re banning for minor exploits glitches they have a lot longer list than what was banned i guerentee at least a third of the community has exploited some glitch one time or another and if that is so that s some pretty backwards priorities when you still can t go a few hours in freeroam without bumping into a cheater that s all i have to say i know the general consensus on steam is was lmao cheaters btfo but i still felt the need to get my thoughts out there and if rockstar plans to treat their players in reddead2 with the same respect they do gtao players they can just piss off disclaimer yes i was one of those affected no i ve never used any sort of mod single or multiplayer i ve never sought after any sort of modded money or xp and yes i have used minor non malicious glitches in the past
