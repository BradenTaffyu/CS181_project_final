2023 creative assembly has decided that going to war with their playerbase is the best option in light of recent failings poor marketing anti consumer practices and outright hostile community management here on steam what was once a thriving studio and series has become a collection of broken promises aggressive sales tactics and outright threats on the community while currently in the process of trying to walk all this back the damage has been done dlc prices have increased while content has decreased when concerns of this were raised the community was quite literally told to buy it or support would be dropped when it was pointed out that support doesn t really exist due to the continuation of major bugs broken ai and gameplay balancing issues the response was to ban people when it was pointed out that making a hero shooter with hyenas was a terrible idea and the community wants rome 3 empire 2 or something along those lines again the community is told to shut up and get in line hyenas has been canceled to the tune of millions in losses and jobs cut somehow the problem in all this is the community when pharaohs got announced it was met with a criticism and push bask as a reskin of total war troy and pushing a sagas title smaller budget scale and price as a full scale total war release wasn t at all what the community wanted bare in mind during all this ca dropped support for three kingdoms because despite selling well and getting good response it wasn t big enough for sega ca so they killed the project apparently a team of just 20 people work on total warhammer content now and ca s studio size has been reduced by 40 with hostilities continuing towards the community though ca is trying to walk it back with a non apology once they got enough push back for banning mod creators on steam which locked them out of updating their mods or even uploading new ones guess ca realized it wasn t the best idea ot remove those actually helping their game i m 100 in support of boycotting ca products until this sort of stuff is addressed and the community given the respect it deserves i ve been playing total war games since the original shogun hit store shelves back in 2000 there was a time when i held out hope we d see shogun 3 but these days i question if studio management and sega will allow the studio to continue long enough to release another game let alone something the community is actually interested in playing been over 10 years since rome ii released and since then it s been calls for rome iii shogun 3 medieval iii and empire 2 yet beyond the total warhammer releases they ve largely missed the mark for bringing something new the community wants three kingdoms had its success but ca and sega weren t happy with fan spending so despite being from 2019 the project is dead buried and forgotten about oh and ca is quick to blame steam for their harsh treatment of the community as someone who has moderated discussion boards on here before for games that s a load of crap but ca is used to shoveling crap to fans so it is on brand rip creative assembly
