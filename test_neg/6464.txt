2020 this game has so many bug and balance issues the community is built on rage and toxicity killers use toxic perks and abilities to their max because survivors used toxic perks to them in a game it becomes a vicious cycle i ve heard from streamers that the game used to have a system of honor but the fact that there needed to be an honor system already shows you how bad the game has been programmed the developers don t listen to anything their community tells them they ll just throw more skins and blood points the in game currency for items as a band aid i cannot in good conscious recommend this game where it stands it has such potential but it s in such a bad place to date i 100 regret giving any of my money to these clowns edit game still pathetically constantly throws in game currency at you just for logging in and begs you to pay for their premium pass meanwhile no real attempts by devs are made to improve gameplay balance but you can take that in game currency to buy items that give you more in game currency how exciting behavior continues to prove they ll never be relevant still 3 10
