2020 with dbd s new release of the silent hill dlc i had to put out a review that i ve been sitting on for awhile now if i could give this game an eh rating with a maybe if it s on sale buy it if you feel like a few good games i would now i don t have hundreds of hours on dbd like others do but i have a fair amount that i feel like i should say something the game is a mess at times pushing cosmetic items that you pay real money for instead of in game currency to releasing dlc s for killers that sometimes are good sometimes are bad this game has always had issues or grinding how ever many hours just to unlock a killer with in game currency or a singular cosmetic item the game is buggy preventing you from ranking up sometimes it s the hit boxes sometimes it s you dcing unintentionally and losing your rank that easily it s annoying and disappointing at the same time considering how fun the game is when there isn t bugs preventing you from being downed or even getting into the game the matchmaking is beyond annoying when it comes to the ranking being put in with greys to purples and reds when you aren t anywhere close to that rank then those people diss you at the end of the match or choose to not help you if you accidently stab them after missing a skill check to heal them because you re clearly a grey rank and just getting the hang of things with that being said don t get me started on the community that s one reason why i haven t played it as much as i had prior you do such a small thing like loop a killer or manage to get out of their sight and youre suddenly the bad guy for playing your part as the survivor some will camp you on the hook some will dc on you some will tunnel you i m a survivor main and at this point it s just plain frustrating to be completely honest it kills the game for me not to mention how much crap people give you if you play with friends despite the game having the option it s looked down upon to other players for whatever reason claiming it s an unfair advantage but the game offers it expect people to use it learn from the experience and move on don t diss them after the match is over if you lose or win it s honestly that simple the devs don t care and i ve honestly been waiting to see if this game turns out like deathgarden although with the game going into the 4th year part of me doubts it but the toxic community is going to kill it at least for me anyways that being said there are some cool factors to the game the whole horror idea is great the classic horror icons is fun the whole idea of the game is great i loved it had a lot of fun with it in the past but recently the bad out weigh the good for me and i launch the game to immediately close it after one match because i m reminded of how annoying the game is to play i know the community is a bit hard to fix in a game but i ve had the conversation many times with friends of how they could stop the hook camping or tunneling etc and it just seems that the devs don t care in that sense they make the money they release killers survivors and don t fix many bugs just a few to get everyone to shut up and carry on it just kinda sucks from how fun the game used to be turning out like this and a lot of camping and dcing because people get frustrated with it part of me just wishes the devs would sit down and realize if they hadn t already the flaws of the game and community and attempt to put into play how to fix certain things instead of just being focused on dlc s and cosmetic items because i m sorry but that might bring new players but it won t keep them for long once they realize how faulty the game actually is
