2022 warframe is a really conflicting game for me on one end the early mid game is really fun you ll probably enjoy learning the different mission types exploring the different open world areas although tread carefully because there are end game enemies in there you can thankfully evade and learning the different warframes movement is fluid gunplay is enjoyable as an arcade proposition and replayablility is high graphics and the soundtrack are also pretty great the story is ok for some reason de have decided to make the game episodic so the story cuts off abruptly on a cliffhanger and it sometimes takes years for the next part of the story to come out the lore is much deeper than expected and a lot of fun to explore but honestly the story s not doing it much justice then however you get to the end game and it s a mess for one the grind levels turn to 11 later in the game rng is cruel in this game and some frame parts have absurdly low drop rates meaning you have to play the same mission 15 20 if not more times to get the part you need the frames that broke me were nidus and harrow all of nidus parts drop in one of the most reviled missions in the game while harrow s neuroptics have a 16 67 drop rate in a spy mission yet i never got one after 25 attempts to make matters worse the initially exciting gameplay gets unbelievably tedious as you play on warframe s ai is mindnumbingly stupid rescue missions will make you want to tear your eyes out and the difficulty bumps come with more enemies per level with longer healthbars increased damage and new units with more powerful aka annoying abilities the enemies don t get smarter and the gameplay doesn t reach any more depth especially if you are playing tanky frames like rhino valkyr or inaros to name a few you can go through some of the hardest missions by just smashing your face against the keyboard to make matters ever worse there s only a limited number of mission types with identical objectives but at different locations and varying degrees of difficulty the constant repetition thanks to the grindy game design and the lack of variety of objectives means late game missions are more of a chore than actual fun the open worlds help since you can do things unrelated to combat like fishing and mining but the problem still lingers finally the elephant in the room is warframe pay to win many youtubers will answer no even when not asked but i beg to differ the game gives you little platinum on purpose and you ll need it for frame and weapon slots while apologists will claim that you don t need to spend a penny to play this game i know for a fact you ll need to have a healthy arsenal of frames and weapons to progress at higher levels for which you ll need slots for which you ll need platinum for which you ll need money yes you can make platinum from trading but my several attempts at selling even fairly rare items at very low prices yielded no results in my 500 hours i put in about 30 i d say that s a fair amount for what the game has to offer but de s insistence on claiming you don t need to put in any money at all to progress is frankly misleading sure you can go through the first 100 hours without spending a penny but past the mid game phase you ll need to splurge if you want to have a chance to finish high level missions or deal with the sentients in conclusion warframe is by no means a bad game it s pretty fun initially de have worked their arses off to get it from the abysmal state it was in during its original release to its current surprisingly polished form and the hours tick by quickly however the more you progress the less fun it gets with repetition dumb ai and ridiculous grinding eating at your very being personally i felt relieved when i uninstalled it and have committed to never playing a grindy game like that ever again but if you can stomach that and you only care about kicking low iq ai arses while zooming around like sonic the hedgehog this game will keep you entertained for hundred of hours
