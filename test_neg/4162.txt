2017 listen i love rockstar and grand theft auto but gta 5 has basically turned into a free to play mobile game that has a 60 prcie tag they say they re giving us all this dlc for free but in truth the unblievable amount of grinding that you would have to do in order to actually enjoy all of these dlc s without paying for shark cards is unrealistic when i say enjoy the dlc s i mean running around doing repetitive missions to make enough money until they come out with the next dlc that will be the exact same boring as the last one the entire system is built in order to milk as much money from their customers as possible and it is disgusting take two interactive is literally you and everyone who plays gta onilne in the ass and thinks that you should be greatful for it oh yea and they will prosecute you for using mods i have very low hopes for the multi player in rdr2
