2021 sorta fun with friends but it s a real bummer alone when you get chased for 30 minutes by other players or sunk with a ship full of treasure that took you 4 hours to collect there are tons of world events in the game and virtually none of them are worth doing with less than 3 4 players because they all attract attention and 90 of the players on the server sailing with you just want to attack you on sight and grief you there is a whole alliance system to join with other player ships and it is virtually unused the bread and butter of the game requires you to leave your ship to get treasure and solve puzzles riddles and there is nothing stopping another group of players from destroying your ship while you re out playing the game and experiencing content even if they don t kill you you now have no way to transport the treasure you just collected and basically have to off yourself in order to respawn at your ship in a new location less and less i end a game session with a feeling of satisfaction and more and more feeling disappointed angry and with a bad taste in my mouth maybe this game isn t for me but in my opinion this is a relaxing beautiful and well designed game ruined by 12 year old trolls
