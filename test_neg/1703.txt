2022 as probably many have said before me this game was not and is still not in a fit state to launch whilst some head scratching design choices for the campaign will hopefully be eliminated with the introduction of the immortal empires the problem with the game runs far deeper units are unresponsive even after the massive update released a few weeks back and will often run in a completely different direction to the one ordered this is extremely visible on the new and imo not very enjoyable settlement battles where the map designers don t seem to have ever played a game of total war before but can also happen on an open map where a unit will walk in the wrong direction and then refuse to move or take any orders for the rest of the battle also missile units will often not fire when enemy units are in range would randomly swap target from the order given the fact the game was released in this state shows an utter contempt for the consumer i have a general rule of never pre ordering which i ve broken twice recently and both times this game and cyberpunk i ve been reminded that you can t trust that a developer s previous work will be any indication of a future product executive greed and disrespect for their paying customers is sadly just too prevalent in the gaming industry
