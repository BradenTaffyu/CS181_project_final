2023 are you gonna devote your entire life to this game no then dont waste your time playing this cesspool that is overran by people that will the devs have absolutely no idea how to design a map the og was great and then after that they decided every map should just be wide open with no cover let alone loot you wanna actually sit down and just enjoy the game nope all you ll get is constant no life lobbies and rage quitting teammates think you might get a skin after waiting 10 levels to get 1 loot bot nope the devs will just flood the market with holos and banners you ll never want to make it where you spend money if you ever want a skin dont waste your time the original devs left and its gone completely downhill since
