2017 warframe is a fantastic example of a game fully supported by the devs for a long long time i first tried it back when it came out and didn t really like it so i reinstalled it several years later after the plane of eidolon update and boy was it a pleasantly different experience there s so many things to do it s mind boggling and it will take some faq and tip list reading as well as playing for a while until it all clicks and you understand what it s all about and it s about magical tech space ninja in the far future there s story and quests and the ability to replay completed missions for more experience and loot and it s all for free there is a premium currency but you can easily trade stuff easily obtainable stuff with other players for that you can play solo or with up to three friends or go public matchmaking there s also pvp if that s your thing although the game is 99 pve the community is also the most positive bunch of people i ve ever seen it s really hard to believe for someone coming from dota and overwatch also the game looks fantastic the visual style is well defined and i really like it i guess it s to be expected from the developers who made my favorite unreal tournament i fully recommend this game give it a try it costs nothing
