2016 had this since launch on ps3 have since owned it on ps4 and now pc only game i ve ever owned on three platforms managed to transfer all my progress houses cash etc from ps3 character game looks fantastic on pc no wonder it took so long this isn t your average pc port performance is generally around 60fps on high ultra mix with a gtx980ti and i7 config to the game personally i d say the campaign is worth the price alone you control three characters with varying degrees of likeability story is lengthy and fun lots of side missions great humour throughout solid script bank heists are great everything you expect from a classic gta game to the multiplayer where a total gem can be found a true open world title you can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer feel free to just explore or undertake in the endless number of missions available you can even play user created games or create your own online heists were added and although only 5 of them they are a huge amount of fun playing especially with friends each heist requires several setup missions all varied in nature heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for gtaonline why would you need currency online because there is literally a mountain of things to buy 100 s of cars planes helicopters yachts weapons properties you need a lot of cash if you want to live the los santos high life participating in jobs online also pays though not much this could be races team deathmatches stunt rides or contact missions pvp is also pretty well done with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry tip if you re low ranked think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players if you re fed up of players c4 ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode which means you can no longer be shot or shoot there doesn t appear to be any online level cap so you can keep advancing though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 minigun my only two negatives would be modders modding splits a community in two some people love it some hate it gtaonline is ravaged by modders my opinion is that modding is fine if on the single player or doing random jokey things online it can lead to hilarious moments shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head but equally ruins the game here s why some may have no intention of harming other players and instead throw endless money on people probably as two fingered salute to r s extortionate cash cards you can purchase with real s 60 for 8m credits great you say not really it s fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones noone does missions because it s easier to beg a modder for cash you see this in every lobby taking cash from modders can also get you banned from gtaonline so even the good modding is bad online why grind a 30 minute mission for 50k when a modder drops 2m in 5 minutes sadly this is now the mindset of most players now to the bad modders modders who use mods for pvp purposes this could be all your usual expected pc game hacks aimbots boosted health invincibility teleportation etc but it can also be so much more modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button they can set it so players spawn and instantly explode leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down gta in task manager they can change the rain to jumbo jets crashing pc s as they cannot cope with the strain 100 s of jumbos falling causes griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage they can drop ufo s on you when you re trying to fight fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars it s literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server best option is to change servers but most the same currently second negative is just a general lack of cool details in los santos in san andreas if you saw a pinball machine or a pool table chances are you could use it in gtav this isn t the case not a massive issue just an observation there is so much more i could say about the game overall the amount of free dlc added since launch plus endless xp events and sales held weekly for in game items new game modes this is by far the best value for money game i ve ever bought 35 is almost incredible given the trend of charging for dlc etc rockstar have given it all for free
