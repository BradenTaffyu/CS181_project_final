2017 people are going to ask me dude how the hell you can review this game when you got less than 100 hours and i actually can understand you at some point but this is my first impression from the game as the time passed on i pretty much got bored of playing cs go all the time and really wanted to find a new game that based on similar concept and my friend told me you really should try r6s for sure cs go is not the same as r6s but they pretty much got one thing in common it requires a lot of strategy and teamwork in order to win matches gameplay by my own experience most of the time the gameplay was feeling kinda slow but that s how it s supposed to be i guess as this game requires strategy and careful planning or you pretty much going to die and you know that you did a huge mistake and as a result you got punished by the game but at the same time it feels rewarding since you learning from it and trying not to do the same thing again community i have already experienced lots of toxicity and many other things from different games that i m playing at the moment such as cs go overwatch and league of legends and i thought it would be quite the same on r6s as well well i was actually really surprised now of course nobody is going to avoid toxicity since people with anger management issues would play the game and i have met some toxic people on this game but most of the time i have got matched with people who actually know how to play the game and also being very helpful for the new players you know how good it is to meet people who act as human beings after coming back from a game with toxic people graphics and optimization when i hear that a game is made by ubisoft my thought is going to be ohh damn another broken game with lots of performance issues but it was really far away from what i thought i m playing on i7 4790 and gtx 1070 on the maxed out settings with the ultra hd textures as well with the t aa and indeed can maintain above 144fps without any problem and the game indeed looks wellin conclusion i really looking forward to keep playing this game in the future and would try a bit the competitive match making really soon would update the review about it later on and have to say that ubisoft did here a great job with the game and indeed improved it overtime and kudos to the devlopers of the game about it i can without any doubt recommend this game for people who are looking for a strategic game that they can enjoy for a long time competitive mm it took quite some time for me to decide how the mm is each game has it s own flaws but the mm does have some really serious issues that make the competitive mode to look like a joke and yes i m mostly talking about leavers the penalties are pretty much worthless and doesn t do anything in order to prevent players from leaving the matches 15 minutes for each penalty may be fine for the first cooldown isn t enough by any means and some matches can be frustrating not because of a poor teamwork but when you have to start the game as 4vs5 or even worse in some games when a person disconnects in the first round it should offer to the team the option like a remake that exists on lol if they want to continue the match or shut it down and only the leaver would get a lose but when everything is going as it should be getting a great teammates or going with your premades then indeed the competitive is worth it and can provide a lot of great time overall rating 8 1018 1 2018 added competitive mm sorry if it looks like a rant
