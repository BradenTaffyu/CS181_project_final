2021 i will one day give this game a more detailed review but for now if you are a hardcore gamer you will enjoy noita it is a punishing game that rewards experimentation and rewards experience with satisfying dominance over its world however even when you get the right set of tools in a randomized run you are still vulnerable your death is always one drop of liquid away it keeps you on your feet and it keeps your adrenaline pumping this game is extremely tough and unforgiving it is trivial to die which resets your run this can be frustrating this is frustrating but that s part of playing a hardcore roguelike this game features extremely deep engineering mechanics which are directly tied to your success in it this is a game where you try out a new thing and probably die as a result but this time you know a bit more and as you learn more and more suddenly the mechanic that killed you will click and boom you know how to make a magic wand that is more akin to tsar bomba than avada kedavra the game world is absolutely laden with secrets and hidden mechanics some of them are almost impossible to figure out on your own though but most are totally discoverable my only gripe with this game is that there is a mid game in your player development in which you are good enough to be comfortable with the game but not good enough to really turn any run into a win run in which you can discover secrets imo the primary goal of this game in this mid game you ll find yourself not random rolling the right tools that you want meaning you get frustrating periods of being stuck at the starter levels with meh equipment it s not that fun but when you get the right tools ohhhhhhhh man it makes it all worth it even if you immediately die because for one moment you were the grim reaper of noita death incarnate the apex predator as you get better with the game you find that the game gives you the right tools more and more often because they were almost always there right under your nose but you were not experienced enough to see it sometimes you just get awful runs though that are only viable for the really really experienced players tl dr this is a game about exploration and science i personally felt like a toddler again while playing this experimenting exploring the world for the first time and eventually much more powerful than i really was it s thrilling also this game is completely whimsical it s art style and theme is beautiful curious and entertaining at all levels a number rating doesn t do this game justice maybe 8 10 because of the balance problems of the mid game but not in a traditional sense this is a good game this is a special game it is unique and a ton of fun a breathe of fresh air but man it can be frustrating sometimes but that s part of the appeal the only part of the game that i think is outright bad is the randomized starting loadouts for reasons that will become clear not starting the game with water or an analog is just an outright hindrance and manifests as needing to find a source of water asap it s not fun you can probably fix that with a mod relatively trivially but i haven t because i bet one day i ll figure out how to use all the starting potions to my advantage
