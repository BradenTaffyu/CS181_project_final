2021 game play its awesome if you have a good pc with decent graphics card installed otherwise god can help characters are great and i like their voices d best when you communicate and play with friends otherwise randoms will either make you mad or make you hero you will find less people who actually talks if u are random you will feel great when you actually win which is like 5 of your total game play various game modes are there where you can switch which will make you busy if you play regularly you will find various new events which if you play will surely give you various in game items guaranteed cost if you are rich just buy the related character and get going if you are fond of skins you either need to buy coins or wait and grind and wait for the skins to pop up from apex packs there are new events and characters which get released at every quarter which you need to but for 950 coins which either you need to buy or grind issues faced whenever there is any big update there are lots of server issues specifically in singapore ones which i play there are also many bugs which comes up sometime like not able to connect to server server crashes visibility issues in games ans so on which are many times known or either random also apart from the anti cheat there are also hackers which are difficult sometimes but surely are there and last but not the least ranking system is a joke i find player on level 3 4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so hence that i think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose general comment and recommendations apart from all the issues and experience i have i have to say its a very good competitive game and i surely get lost inside while playing which is worth so a big thumps up for that anyways thanks for reading my review i am still playing it and love it everyday cheers
