warning in a list longer than i m comfortable admitting r6s has hands down the most toxic community this includes lol and wow if you are new to the game expect to play a lot before feeling competent as there is a huge learning curve to the game as you learn how to use counter each operator learn each map bomb site learn the spawn peeks learn each guns recoil control all while your team begs you to uninstall and go back to fortnite if you can get past all of that then yea it s pretty fun
