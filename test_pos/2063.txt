2022 probably the only battle royale i liked i fell in love with the aesthetic of the game at first which is what made me want to try it the character designs and the maps are exquisitely designed when i actually tried the combat it felt so seamless and realistic i love it the learning curve is quite large and actually requires skill and not just spamming the attack button i like that they also managed to add in nun chucks as a melee option it s also not p2w as you only pay for some cosmetics all the characters and some skins can be bought with in game currency and there are also a lot of events that give out free cosmetics through limited time quests
