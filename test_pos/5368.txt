2016 this game is awesome really awesome but recently there has been a lot of problems with the comunity a lot of people on this review page say the comunity is nice and cool but here s the thing its changing for one thing the amount of teamkillers has increased dramatically especially if you play on casual one time i went into a match on bank on offensive and was imediatly killed by a guy i waited for someone to kill him cause well he was an as hole but nobody did and i realized they didn t because they were playing together like they knew eachother and aparrently they wanted to play alone people like this ruin the game and ubisoft needs to do something to properly punish players that do this also i have recently been encountering nice and friendly people less and less just more as holes there are three kinds of people i play with in this game mostly guys who dont have mics don t coordinate and don t comunicate with their team and get themselves killed first secondly there are asses who will coordinate with you but insult and criticize you for every mistake you make you ll encounter these guys mainly on ranked they don t like inexperienced players and lastly the friendly people who are rare now they will help you give the needed call outs and back you up in a match and those are the best people in this game and even with everything i said its still not enough to not recomend this game just if you are gonna buy it try to find a clan or just some friends to play it with if you can cause the randomes are wild cards now thank you for taking the time to read this review and i hoped it helped you make your decision because this is one of the most tactical and team based multiplayer fps s of this decade and its an amazing accomplishment by ubisoft and i hope they make changes to help make the comunity of players more apreciative
