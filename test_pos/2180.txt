2023 mixed or negative reviews not about gameplay review bomb from chinese playersthe gameplay is unanimously enjoyed but crazy amounts of review bombing from where the developers are from if you were to check the reviews for your own languages you ll notice that the game rating showcases itself as very positive as shown here if you re wondering what they re complaining about it s primarily about the pricing in their currency the time it took to finish development on the game apparent lies to the chinese playerbase and the so called lack of content some of these points i cannot attest but the lack of content i disagree since the content offered is varied and unique 20 unique maps for a similarly priced game to gang beasts which this game takes heavy inspiration to if the pricing is unfair for the chinese then regional pricing does need to be adjusted anyways what does the gameplay offer a simple party game beat em up that you knock out your friends or opponents online toss them off the edge or play objective based modes inspired by real sports or mini games to work together towards the maps are all varied and unique in their own right unique gimmicks and hazards that gives each maps personality the controls are easy to pick up but may take a couple games to get a hang of strong wind ups of running punches small jabs jump kicks slight kicks or headbutts that while your character moves like a wobbly drunkard not too good at unarmed combat there are plenty of physical weapons to harness from ranged to melee tasers crossbows ice guns shovels lollipops and more it s a super casual extremely satisfying fun arcade y fighter play with some buds and you will guarantee a blast of laughter and fun modes of play standoff 1 life 2v2v2v2 ffa or 4v4 originally posted by author 9 maps the primary goal is to knock people off maps here provide hazards like a creeping gas a chilling blizzard a shaky bridge a submerging submarine a strong wind tunnel chilly waters on a breaking glacier fear of heights on a fighter jet a gravity defying black hole or an intensifying wavy floating bridge all with the general premise of knocking out and throwing off opponents each one gets more and more intense over time becoming more difficult to recover onto the map if you do get thrown off fully don t fret you can still influence the outcome of the match with some objects to throw at players while spectating team score 4v4 objective modes originally posted by author 9 maps american football soccer air hockey candy collection arcade machine fighting trebuchet launching electrical ball scoring and rail train racing or balloon safe extraction all with their little gimmicks and the main premise of beating the hell out of each other these have respawns if hazards do end you arcade 10 life 4v4 mode originally posted by author 2 maps a pool of respawns lives for each team knock players out of a cabin into a blizzard or throw players onto the tracks of an incoming train comparison to the competitionin comparison to gang beasts the movement mechanics are much more streamlined and simplified for example climbing is just a combination of two buttons grab jump while moving in the direction you want to climb towards whereas in gang beasts you had to raise your arms alternating both hands while grabbing all while holding jump you basically have to play qwop in gang beasts just to recover after being thrown off it would be a lot more difficult to master which seems wrong for a party game in map design this game is much more physics influenced varied with accompanying toys weaponry to play around with more unique modes and more ways to play than the alternative it seems that party animals is just an upgrade in every single way my qualmswith the positive there are always some complaints they are not enough to deter me into a negative review but i believe they should be addressed for the australian players there should be provided oce servers offline functionality should be a feature as promised as this game should not always be online p2p fallback would be nice if the servers ever did get shut down the price of cosmetics seem a bit expensive during these hard times should be lowered also a gacha system in a paid game seems odd and misplaced in total you can earn quite a few of the gacha rolls for free but it is limited you will only be guaranteed one legendary if you do fully progress and obtain all of the free currency and surprise eggs that may feel a bit tedious or long to endure if it was possible to just earn egg coins perpetually with no limit i would find it quite fair it would seem that most of the negative reviews are not about its gameplay despite any of these problems i believe the pros heavily outweigh the cons the game is well enough fun for its price and has provided me the most amount of joy and laughter that no other party game has come close to i extremely recommend the game for all the positive reasons above the negative review s complaints are valid but i don t think it should drag the game into obscurity it s too fun for that and it truly doesn t deserve it
