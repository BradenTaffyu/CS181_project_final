2020 i played nearly 600 hours of this game on origin before the steam release which is practically unheard of for me in any game i m also not a huge multiplayer pvp game fan so to get so invested in this game says a lot to me with that last thought in mind i m also far from a great player i ll have my moments and i d say i m pretty mediocre at this point but i ll still get slapped down pretty hard when my mmr seems to start getting too high even still i ve steadily brought my k d ratio up from a miserable 23 at launch to a current 60 with starting out season 7 it s not perfect and there have been issues plaguing nearly every season most recently this season s biggest issue is the battle pass which was tweaked to make the grind insufferable and hard for any normal person like me to dream of completing previously there were widespread issues with hits not registering and as with many pvp multiplayer games there s a certain toxic element in the playerbase that can be hard to avoid i ve spent probably 95 of my time playing this game with a pre made squad to avoid playing with randoms never mind the 20 tick servers they ve been using since launch which may be unacceptable to those with more experience in pvp games like this even with the issues this game does have it s still a blast to play each character is unique and the movement is quick snappy and just feels so good even the sound effects of breaking shields and knocking down opponents are incredibly satisfying i may not be joining in on this season s battle pass without a major overhaul to minimize the excessive grind but i m definitely going to be putting another stack of triple digit hours into this game going forward edit 1 a bit under 20 hours for me to unlock all of the steam achievements which on origin took me some 150 hours to accomplish some of these unlocked early with my carried over origin data but i have still pulled off a win with 8 different legends across the 4 different hero types to feel like i legitimately earned it on steam as well i ve also so far kept my season k d ratio slightly over 1 0 after 100 games so i m super excited to see just how much i ve improved cannot recommend this game enough for a battle royale pvp game to anyone who has friends to play it with edit 2 now approaching 250 hours in steam so roughly 850 hours total including origin and still having a mostly great time the newest season was absolutely the most stable so far as well even if the new map is a bit of a mixed bag
