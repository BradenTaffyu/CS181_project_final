2020 campaign 6 10 multiplayer would be 9 5 10 but it s unplayable so 1 10 zombies 11 10zombies is realistically the only reason to buy this game anymore you can t get into multiplayer lobbies and campaign is lacking in comparison to other games within the black ops series at least zombies makes up for this and is well worth the dlc money you pay for plus custom maps are a whole new experience
