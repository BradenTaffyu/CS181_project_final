2023 i am a 50 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old my son has recently started playing call of duty in less than a week he has already played more than 20 hours it was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always with his friends or watching youtube videos so i decided to create a steam account to play with my son i started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so i was pretty lost i asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game i liked it as it was the best time i have had with my son since my wife died playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house
