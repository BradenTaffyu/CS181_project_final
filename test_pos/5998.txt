2016 play as survivor sneaky black woman get meat hooked killer stands directly in front of me slashing my limp noodle body over and over see two teammates sneaking nearby waiting for opporunity to save me they don t get the chance killer doesn t move from that spot until entity takes me see him do the same to two more survivors camping you guys are just bad play as killer spooky nurse hook survivor immediately leave to go check out some generators elsewhere check back on dirty hookered body every now and then wow camping how does it feel to be pure cancer i m salty the survivors are salty but i understand now salt tastes good this game is hella fun and succesful jukes can be pretty satisfying especially when you get those heat of the moment scenarios and the monster just completely loses you and runs off in the opposite direction while you cheekily crouch in the middle of a cornfield or those satisfying times when you see a sneaky survivor in the distance crouching behind a rock or climbing into a locker thinking they re safe only for you to round the corner and deliver the final blow before they even know what s happened though there are some bugs i ve encountered there s the basic falling through the ground bug but that happens in a lot of games and it s only happened to me once in dbd when i was playing as the trapper it didn t blink me back to the map after falling for a certain amount of time either just got stuck there in skybox oblivion forever free win for those four lucky souls oh god don t do it if you play as the nurse for the love of god don t try to blink up the basement stairs survivors try to jump over barricades or hide in cabinets but getting caught by the monster and picked up during these animations sometimes causes the survivors to glitch out and get stuck in the air they even orbit parralel to and around the monster like they re attached to a certain point of him as he spins around everyone is confused and visually it s hilarious the monster can just drop them on the ground and pick them up again which fixes the issue but it really breaks your immersion when you see this happen still funny though playing as a survivor occasionally any kind of interaction with a monster can cause your game to crash which is a pretty terrible bug considering the rules of the game i sometimes notice people disconnect after they get picked up or hooked by a monster i thought they might just be rage quitting and i m sure there s plenty of that out there but after my own game has crashed at exactly these points right after a monster s finished their animation of picking me up or placing me on a hook my game just ctd s and i can t help but wonder if it happened to those people as well this is pretty rare i ve got just under 150 ish hours and it s only happened to me three times but it s still pretty concerning when it does adding to that last bug if you re playing as a killer on the off chance that a disconnected players character magically remains in the game absolutely do not try to interact with them i know it looks like an easy kill as they just stand there complacently but that empty body is now actually a deadly trap for killers don t pick them up and don t try to hook them you will get stuck and freeze anywhere between 10 20 seconds in my experience for reasons i still haven t yet deciphered you can try and slash them and leave them on the ground to bleed out but that s as far as i would go in that regard also this happened to me only once whilst playing as the trapper regardless of all this there is still a pretty solid game hidden underneath you ll be enjoying yourself or stressing out about being hunted down like an animal more than dealing with any bugs and whatnot equipment add ons and offerings are all consumable so use em as you get em or hoard them all like some sort of digital kleptomaniac like me because you can only use them once but perks are good you get to keep those for the most part you ll lose your perks and have to earn them again if you choose to prestige but if you decide not to then you keep them forever make a bee line for perks as soon as they show up on the bloodweb or you ll regret it the hefty buggery brings the score down quite a bit and if you re looking for a perfect experience then you will probably be disappointed in that case i d strongly recommend waiting for those bugs to be fixed before making a purchase however 98 of the time i m still having great fun so at the very least i ll give it a 5 10 or a 6 if we re being generous pretty good i still recommend it overall now get out
