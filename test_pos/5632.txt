2015 i never take it upon myself to publicly review games but siege is easily a breath of fresh air for today s gaming community it isn t all about running and gunning you can t always be the hero expect those lucky clutch situations a game that requires a bit of patience of bit of planning and a lot of anxiety only negativity i ve seen from this game is about the intergration of uplay and even then just bite the bullet it s well worth the 2 extra minutes it takes for the steam uplay intergration to set up no need to whine over nothing personally the only gripe i have is the inhability to choose which terriorist hunt game mode you have for lone wolf maybe i m missing something or maybe an option will be patched in later who knows tl drits good servers are fine uplay is uplay but its well worth it
