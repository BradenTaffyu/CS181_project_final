2020 they market it with the pixel simulation and it s certainly very cool and makes many other games feel horribly rigid but the real draw is the wand spell building system it allows you to eventually build totally broken god tier wands erasing anything in an instant nice power trip until you are polymorphed into a sheep with 1 hp the game is difficult and sometimes death feels a bit unfair but even then it still manages to pull me right back in for just one more run the world is also bigger than it first seems so there is plenty to explore i just wish there were more in game hints to secrets and lore much of that stuff is very obscure and hard to discover organically without resorting to reading stuff from wiki according to steam play time tracking this might be my most played game ever and although quantity does not equate quality it is an indication of something here
