2015 never had my heart beat so fast while playing video games than this 8 10edit since my review came op as one of the most helpful i ve decided to expand it with some detailsrainbow six siege is mainly about two teams fighting agaisnt each other in a fps counter terrorism world one team as the defenders terrorists other team as attackers counter terrorits the special thing about this game is the strategi and the destruction of the maps every game can feel very different because both teams has a fair amount of characters to choose from who all has one special abililty the destruction is a very big factor why i think the game is great it gives it a lot of replayability there are so many different ways to defend a point or even to attack one the teamplay and strategi is also important your team will have a way higher chance of winning if you all communicate and plan your attacks the singleplayer isnt as great as the other rainbow games there are basically two ways of playing singleplayer one is to play lonewolf in terrorist hunt terrorist hunt is your team or your self agaisnt ai the other way is to play situations which are premade lonewolf maps with ai there is no campaign the design of the game is really mlg as i would call it all the characters doesnt really look like counter terrorist units which isnt a bad thing it just kinda takes the imersion away otherwise the map is just trying to simulate the real world which it does nicely the graphics runs well on my computer with the highest settings the gun play and gameplay is close to perfect if you ask me its nothing like arma 3 but it has a very good feel to it and sometimes even so much that i feel like i m a swat solider breaching into a building d there are sometimes where its kinda unrealistic but its nothing close to a problem the commuinity i have played with is nice they play toghter work togther and most importantly they communicate have had some games with people that didnt work togther at all but it doesnt ruin it nothing about the game it self i just want to add that ubisoft have made a lot of stuff like aac unity i m very happy how this turned out since it was one of my childhood games but that doesnt mean that ubisoft are the good guys they still use uplay and many of their games are overpriced if you ask me thats mainly why i would say you shouldnt buy the game but the game is still a ton of fun and if you want it i truely recommend it now go read the top rated review insted of mine
