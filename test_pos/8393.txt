2023 this is by far one of the closest souls like game out of all the souls like and i say this as a huge compliment it s obvious where the game takes its inspirations from but where other games have failed this game has certainly managed to achieve a great deal is it perfect hardly but then so are dark souls 2 3 however the game s tight combat system high level of polish and general vibe ties together so well that without prior knowledge if someone told me that this was a from software game i would have believed it the game also has superb performance and i didn t run into a single bug playing since early access this is pretty crazy given buggy releases in recent years out of all the souls like games i ve played however this turned out to be the most difficult souls like i ve ever played the bosses are difficult unique but mechanically fair some fights will feel unfair but for the most part it just means that the player needs to get better at parrying or use the appropriate gear overall very impressed with this surprise hit and would definitely be on the look out for future games from these devs
