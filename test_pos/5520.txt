2017 it s basically counter strike with hero characters and a really weird business model but it s also one of the best multiplayer fpss out there great tactical action solid gunplay well balanced mechanics and consistently supported with new content and fixes the destructible environments make for great emergent gameplay and are a fantastic idea overall siege is definitely worth buying don t get the starter edition though
