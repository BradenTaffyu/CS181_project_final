2022 elden ring is the latest game developed by fromsoftware a company well known for its souls franchise this time fromsoftware took a departure from its standard linear semi open world approach to its game development instead it opted for an open world approach with heavy reliance on souls game mechanics after i learned that elden ring would be developed as an open world souls game i was worried about how the game would turn out however elden ring turned out to be something far better than i had imagined pros a vast world filled with activities secrets sidequests enemies and bosses that will entertain players for hundreds of hours a wonderful sense of exploration that is unparalleled in its scope and design boss battles that are difficult yet extremely satisfying beautiful graphics that show noticeable improvements over older titles such as dark souls 3 and sekiro great map system that guides players in the right direction and helps them search for secrets and activities a wide variety of weapons with different ashes of war that allows for diverse gameplay an intuitive and efficient weapon upgrade system a wide variety of spells incantations talismans and armors to choose from stellar aesthetics art design cons performance issues micro stuttering and framerate drops that got better compared to the launch version but still need more work while enemies bosses are mostly fair a few of them are overly difficult and can feel a little cheap overall i think elden ring is a masterpiece that offers new possibilities to an open world genre which has become somewhat stale in recent years similar to what breath of the wild did five years ago elden ring proves that the open world genre can evolve and become something truly remarkable
