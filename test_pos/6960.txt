2016 this game is really fun to play upon first release the game was poorly optimized even for people who had some very nice hardware for their gaming pc however developers saw this and eventually made the game nice and smooth i originally played the call of duty series on a playstation 3 but eventually moved on pc when playing black ops 3 on here the nostalgia hit me from all the fun times i ve had with my friends from black ops 1 and black ops 2 the majority of my playtime from all of the black ops series including this one is playing zombies mode but i also really enjoyed the last two game s campain and multiplayer mode i was highly disappointed with the campain seeing how it had nothing to do with the previous two games but at the same time there wasn t really a way to continue the story and i m actually a bit glad of that the multiplayer was a blast it felt just like the other games as for zombies it is one of the best experiences i ve had in a video game especially from the workshop content there are so many remakes and remasters of older maps that the steam community has commited themselves to making and even new original creative maps if you liked the last two games you would probably enjoy this one as well
