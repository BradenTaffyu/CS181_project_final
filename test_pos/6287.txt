2018 after more than 700 hours within two years of playing dead by daylight i can highly recommend this game to everyone who liked to play hide and seek in his childhood wether you prefer to play aggressive or sneaky you get on your costs in this game many variations of maps killers survivors skins perks items and addons help you to have a unique playstyle and make every game different and forces you to adapt on it all this provided a lot of fun to me with a funny dev team which did a pretty good job so far leading into my highest playtime per year and my highest playtime in total on steam is on dead by daylight upcoming chapters which you can partly unlock by playtime keep the game interesting graphics and matchmaking with friends could be improved
