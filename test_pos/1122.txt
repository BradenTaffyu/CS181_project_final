this is without a doubt best game i have ever played in my entire life game developers should learn how to design an open world game from elden ring the map is filled with secrets after secrets dungeons after dungeons and many more meaningful activities that directly affect your character and progress it s simply a genius game design i never got bored throughout my 70 hours of playthrough not even once what made me fall in love with the game was it s universe i have always disliked the japanese style of story telling that how the world was just too weird and were filled with silly and out of place jokes combined with cringe characters i just couldn t handle it on the other hand western style story telling was more serious and had more intriguing concepts but were executed poorly and lacked a soul to keep me interested this game is the perfect middle ground because this world was created by george r r martin and the game was done by a japanese studio only downsides of this game are it s ui awful and they couldn t calculate torrent s fall damage but those two are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and can be easily disregarded also how about giving an option to respec before starting an ng or atleast a warning overall 10 10
