2017 product received for free early access review i used to think like some others that it isn t worth the 4 but once you actually play around with it you ll see that it s more than worth it do note that this is not similar to rainmeter in any way as rainmeter is desktop widgets whereas this has interactive wallpapers yeah the workshop has a lot of anime stuff but you can usually find something worth using or customizable to your needs with a little searching or even make it yourself if you feel so inclined
