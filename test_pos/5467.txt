2017 this game has been frustrating lately spawn peeking is frustrating peekers advantage is annoying combine both of them and it is horrible glaz s buff is overkill he was strong enough as he was fuze s projectiles bounce too far and they do too much damage matchmaking is broken you can start the search wait 4 mins then restart the search and get instantly in game operation health didn t change much the game used to have a sold community in feb july of 2017 but i have found recently that there are many more smurfs and trolls my main problem is ranked in ranked i can run into one guy who is on an alt that team kills or trolls he could disconnect and then we play a man down and lose then if i have two bad games i have almost deranked an entire rank why does the rank go down approx 100 points even if you play 1 or 2 men down it doesn t make any sense
