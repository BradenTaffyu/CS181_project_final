2023 pros the game looks very beautiful plays quite chill and takes a bit of time to learn the mechanics but it s very nice indeed cons the game is infested with all sorts of hacks and devs don t seem to care at all i ve seen people flying using teleport having auto aim taking zero damage in combat etc playing against hackers is annoying and i hope they fix it in the future or else it will be unplayable without hacks soon
