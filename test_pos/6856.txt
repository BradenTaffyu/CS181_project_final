2020 tl dr get while on sale okay but seriously the zombies in call of duty black ops is good at least in a conceptual manner for example in pack a punching a weapon more than once you receive what s called an alternative ammo type aat for short and this makes killing zombies a lot easier to make this more balanced it only activates every so often perhaps every 30 seconds or so the maps in this game have a lot of detail and content in them they re vast and expansive while actually still having stuff to do in all the various nooks and crannies at time of writing i ve only done one easter egg so far that ee being the flytrap from the giant which per step literally the same as on der riese in previous games the maps are designed well in terms of general layout a fair amount of challenge but not too terribly difficult it s not quite casual friendly but neither is the price even with sale but i feel as though the learning curve isn t absolutely terrible for anyone who s serious about having fun with zombies on that note about maps this is the first treyarch made game since world at war to natively support mods still currently the only one actually slowly but surely the classic world at war maps are even being ported to black ops it takes time due to the newer engine not having much backwards compatibility but it s happening community made custom content especially maps is great modders are being hunted to extinction by devs and their proprietary software and end user license agreements each new map also feels truly unique in an aesthetic sense with regards to zetsubou no shima isle of despair for example you would think by the japanese sounding title that it s some kind of shi no numa swamp of death clone however you d be sorely mistaken with such an assumption it does indeed have imperial japanese zombies and lots of kanji on various signs throughout the map as well as a tropical climate and even a quasi symmetrical layout but treyarch really tried to make it unique in most every other way you ll just have to see it to believe it now with as much praise as i give this game on a conceptual level things are different when put into practice black ops has absolutely terrible graphical optimization my fps goes from 150 down to 120 all the way down to the 70s literally several times every minute without any apparent rhyme or reason as to why this even happens and the graphics don t even look that good at max settings the textures and models are pretty good looking but the shadows and ambient occlusion are frankly lacking in that manner black ops do it way better note black ops has actually amazing performance as well as spectacular model details but a lot of textures are extremely so low res that it s visible at 480p even at max settings particularly dlc black market camos but i digress still way better optimization however even if low res textures are the least of that game s issues ing terrible sound design i will hear the zombies at all times in black ops black ops black ops and even world at war they ll either be walking or at least groaning whereas in you have zombies literally sneaking up on you in full and absolute silence half the time on that note about audio there are a lot of recycled sfx jingles from previous games but in a pretty tasteless manner like you hear the lock jiggling round end cue from mob of the dead on guess which map the giant of course and you don t even hear the motd new round cue while numerous plot holes were introduced in black ops with origins these plot holes were opened up even wider just so blundaddy jason blundell could milk the story with a bunch of multiverse nonsense and actually turn it into something even if poorly written campaign is forgettable multiplayer is trash and honestly has been since black ops no i didn t suck at it it s just really boring in comparison to the og black ops a game also developed by treyarch mind you that or hell even to the new modern warfare which wasn t developed by treyarch but was published by activision who publishes all call of duty titles and infinityward cooperates with treyarch on a regular basis namely for teasers full trailers etc so with that i give call of duty black ops about a 7 2 10 in terms of rating it if you re serious about call of duty zombies you should get this game but wait for a sale thank you for coming to my ted talk
