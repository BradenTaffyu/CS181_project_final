2016 edit the starter edition mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists my approval still stands as a 30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time i ll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone i ll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that i was really into was titanfall causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers the starter edition is a smart implementation by ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many to be clear there is no difference between starter players and regular players besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new operators classes starter players play on the same servers as everyone else play on all the same maps and have all the same unlockable operators available as everyone else to explain how your starter game would begin i ll briefly explain how this game rather generously doles out content all maps and operators are free and included in patches the operators only being paid for in time played or with ubibucks if desired this makes the season pass practically useless on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map operator access which is now a six month or so privilege this means the player base isn t segmented and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the season pass or dlc that said the starter edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender along with enough ubibucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal everything you do in the game earns you renown which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins cosmetics starter players require about 12 000 renown to purchase an operator while regular players only need about 2 000 ubisoft calls this grinding to reach 12 000 but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn t feel like grinding to reach anything the reward is that the game is fun to play that being said i know that in game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing titanfall if there s to be things to unlock i m actually glad it is the operators in the 9 10 hours i ve mainlined since buying the starter edition i earned enough renown to purchase an on sale at 7 500 with a few thousand left over the grinding is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown and there s at least one operator on sale in rotation every week here s the thing though operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents my point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators you ll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and or bought a couple to see how they play that should be the clarifying out of the way i ve always wanted to try this game from a glance it looked like the evolution of cs go i ve waited years for without the harshness and indie mod nature of a game like insurgency and i wasn t far off like many people it was hard to justify a full 60 purchase when cs go is 15 and regularly goes on sale but ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me i want to address the issue of the full price for only multiplayer argument i don t see the issue as that was par for years ut 2k4 quake 3 arena etc especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here this game doesn t need a campaign the addition of a high budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single player content does in fact do there are 10 situations each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills gadgets and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into siege multiplayer there s also the option to play co op terrorist hunt as a lone wolf instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself i only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future the game already has deadly bots for other single player content and the possibility is definitely there why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter especially if you re experienced with them because nothing else on the market plays the way that siege does it is a slow game with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly the lean left right buttons are essential to leaning around corners the time to die is extremely fast with 1 3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading it might be a slow pace at times but it causes a white knuckle tension that i haven t seen matched it s thrilling to rappel up the side of a building toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that s made me cheer out loud sometimes siege is like action shooter chess a game that s simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master a high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay it may not be for you but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen the port if it even is a port is excellent offering all the options that pc players expect to scale from low end to high end rigs it has 2 unique aa solutions an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub pixel aliasing and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies msaa between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies it has built in twitch streaming features it natively supports xbox 360 1 controllers and dualshock 4 offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable basically the devs understand pc gaming and this is no hobbled ps4 port this is also the first time that i ve had to deal with uplay it s annoying i guess to have a second client launch on top of steam but that s all i notice of it it doesn t crash it doesn t use up multiple gbs of ram it doesn t install adware and it didn t give me or my computer or my family aids i was expecting at least some of that based on what i ve heard but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game a minor annoyance at worst for me so that was a of words and i might sound like i m gushing but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it the 15 entry made it possible for me to play and i wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you re getting into can t wait to put in even more hours
