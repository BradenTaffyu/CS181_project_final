2023 this game is truly unique and you won t find an experience like this anywhere else the simulated physics serve as an amazing backdrop for some really neat experiences and interacts with the spell crafting system wonderfully the spell crafting itself is basically limitless and there are always new ways to learn how to deal with enemies or obliterate everything on the screen in one click including yourself this game is really hard it s unfair and you may die a few hundred times before getting a win but some deaths are quick and you can just start right over and learn from each one and once you ve finally won you ve still barely scratched the surface absolutely recommend it just know that you will die a lot mostly by your own hand
