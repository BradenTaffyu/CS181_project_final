2021 this game reminds of of hubba bubba chewing gum the first time you take a piece of that sweet bubble gum the flavor is incredible and after some time it starts to taste like crap and yet you take another piece over and over what i m trying to say is that this game starts of very fun and the more you play it the worse it gets yet after you rage about being tunneled by a 7 year old prestige 3 cannibal main who is only allowed to play on the weekend at his dad s house and is 10 ranks bellow you you still play this game its basically a love and hate relationship
