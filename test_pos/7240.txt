short version joke review we have a sphinx mommy in the game if i could give eternal bond for her i would fr whoever was behind her is a true champ she gets aggroed if you grab the big milkers she flees if you hit her face aka ruins her skincare best boss in the game hands down sphinx mommy community created artwork for dragon s dogma 2 by nightlizard best waifu and female voice in the game fr expressions honest review spoiler free so this game followed the footstep of the first game in some aspects this game is an improvement in other aspects this game is a let down at least for me the good traits of the game are bigger than the downsides the positive traits exploration of the game was solid one of the best i had since i ve played skyrim for the first time it was genuinely fun exploring the biomas fighting the ambushes and getting to random places with nice loots i changed pawns very often and the improvement in the ai of the pawns and the enemies was really nice the story itself isnt linked for the first game and in fact is better explained in this game theres a lot of dialogues which explains from the beginning to the end of the why are you doing this in the first place you may in fact dislike the end of the game for example but the writing itself was an improvement of the first game dragons dogma combat wise you have some hidden mechanics such as medusa head being a hitkill weapon accessory to any enemy in the game its forsaken normal enemies loots but faster xp farming go brrrrrrr ok you want that sweet loot use mystic archer maister skill it one shot most enemies in the game yet what i had the most fun was the jedi spearhand you literally fight like a jedi in dragons dogma with that haahaha and my fav class was warfarer drip check with any weapon psa hire a pawn mage with celestial peon it s the best support skill in the game i think its legit the best skill any team pawn could have negative traits denuvo enough said about that mtx are totally optional doesnt impact the gameplay its for lazy gamer cheat feature capcom is doing this since dmc5 doesnt warrant a negative review in my opinion as everything they sold as dlc you get in the game i had literally 7 fast travel portcrystal and 40 ferrystone in my run so dont waste your money in rubbish i got the deluxe edition due to the ost dd2 ost is fine ending song was beatiful but the general ost of the game i found worse than the first game i switched bgm to the original game and i had a blast playing the game feel a bit sad due to only liking 2 bgm of dd2 it is what it is in dragons dogma 1 we had around 6 8 skills avaible to use in dragons 2 every class only has 4 slots this was a downgrade a massive one at that luckily the mod saints of nexus made a mod which unlocks 8 skills slots for the arisen i genuinely wish this game gets an update for that and devs change to 8 skill slots cause gameplay became repetitive if you use big dps skills theres some skills which doesnt do a lot of damage but like you could run with a greatsword and impale at the wall a big fatass lizard and that was dope af i have a strong issue about the fashion in the game i ve beaten the game with warrior gear the best armors i could find without spending wc crystals are legit underwear as armors i literally beat the game with two skimp outfits cause they had better stats than fullplate armor mind ya it was somewhat funny seeing my 6 feet tall arisen with a leather underpants smashing a dragon i was legit like kek not to speak about my pawn being useful af as a warrior or an archer but i m planning to change her to archer cause the clothes arent so skimpy endgame gear the 12y of waiting for a sequel was worth it
