2017 review from a random casual gamerwhen they mentioned this game to me i was very skeptical since in the first months it received very negative reviews but after a good amount of hours 141 when this review was written i can say that this game is overall a good game here s why pros good anticheating compared to the initial months where the game was overall filled with hackers the introduction of battleye brought a complete revamp of the game now the game is almost completely free from any hacking threat although there still are like in every other game but luckily they re dealt pretty quickly highly strategical game but with a twist this game allows different kind of playstyle from the slow gameplay to the more fast paced one there are pros and cons for both playstyle but overall the amount of operators available allows for different styles keep in mind that operators are released continously gameplay well developed the game is good for what is meant to propose more precisely the game gives a short quarters first person shooter and that s what it exactly gives you will not find great sniper battles or epic battles in this game in addition to that the maps never get boring as all the maps give a complete freedom and alllow the game to have new twists even after a hundred hours like my case technical precision the game is well made in terms of precision of sound and environmental destruction the effort they put to create maps that allow a player to be completely free in his moves is something that is indeed very positive updates the game is continously updated to add new content and will be like these for some other years making the game still alive and active after 2 years cons highly frustrating although the game is good for casual gaming it might turn out to be very frustrating in some cases where you can be hit from a completely hidden place without even having the chance to see the enemy not to mention some operators being completely broken microtransactions yes the game has microtransactions in it and they also cost a lot in particular cases especially when buying new operators most of the microtransactions are needed for cosmetics which is fine but the problem is that they are also used to buy new operators in fact the game gives you around 20 free operators but all the others that come in other operations yes their dlcs are called operations cost a lot and basically you need an enormous amount of hours to buy them as a free to play player overall i highly recommend this game especially when played with friends the community is overall good 8 5 10 nerf glaz
