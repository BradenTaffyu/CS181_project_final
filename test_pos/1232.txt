2022 i was quite excited for this game since announcement and it surpassed my expectations i had really good time with it even though i was stuck in some instances but eventually managed through i did not expect game world to be this massive at all there was so much freedom to do anything anywhere i was lost multiple times exploring the world huge variety of summons even though mimic was a great idea but that summon should not exist makes other summons almost obsolete there were some stutters and hiccups on my pc occasionally maybe 5 6 hard crashes but did not bother that much i understand that such big world was difficult to fill with hundreds of different bosses so they were recycled multiple times but i think fromsoftware should just remove boss health bars from many mini bosses and treat them as elite enemies legacy story bosses were incredible ok gonna stop before this becomes an essay just wanted to say that game was a blast i had totally great time really well done fromsoftware thank you other open world games have big shoes to fill now cheers er wave
