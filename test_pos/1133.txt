2022 after getting 100 i can safely say this is in my opinion the best soulsborne game everything is viable there are plenty of astonishing skills spells weapons and armor to try when you see a video with a title op x item i can assure you there are 100 others just as good or even better play how you like it will carry you through the game also the scenery atmosphere and music are so good it is hard to fathom that this game actually exist it was also a bit harder game for me at least at start few of the bosses are absolutely brutal in melee combat but i managed to ugs my way through eventually and now for a few bad things some things are still bugged arcane scaling weapons and performance issues and occasional crashes otherwise was a smooth run edit now that those few things are mostly fixed the game is just a masterpiece 10 10 would die to instant curse or bleed again
