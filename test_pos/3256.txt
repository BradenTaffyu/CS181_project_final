one of the best gta games without a doubt i only played the single player part of the game and it s great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one gta iv gta iv had more meat on it what do i mean with more meat more sidequests more side activities a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters comedy clubs to visit they did a good job with gta v okay but in comparison to gta iv it s lacking part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story dlc missions once they got their success with the online part of the game intatiably greedy rockstar the map feels considerably smaller as well so game s good but it feels lacking in terms of what it s predecessor did single player greately sad tbh
