2018 this game is fun if you re into competitive and fps games just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game don t get the starter edition you only get like 2 operaters one per side and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest which is just time consuming its best to get the standard edition if you re on a lower budget you get all the base game operators which is 10 per side so 20 in total the community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5 you will all have a good time sound matters in the game any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map there are so many ways to enter breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun you may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms i hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works have fun playing it update this is my fault as of march 6th 2018 ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now 3 per side so if you d like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators including dlc year operators for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown in game currency then go ahead summary good game boys get it now
