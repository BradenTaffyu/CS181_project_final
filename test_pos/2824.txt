2023 i like how the other reviews sound like wikipedia articles here s an actual review from an actual person if you said that gta v is the best game of all time i wouldn t argue with you what rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated we re still playing it religiously 10 years after it came out one decade let that sink in the use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we ve never seen before getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting each of the protagonists holds their own trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever i love the al pacino vibe that michael gives off and franklin s journey is awesome to see the gameplay is top notch i love the gunplay and the driving is stellar it s much better than the boat steering from gta 4 the story is incredible there isn t much of an emotional attachment but it s still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs i replay this game once a year because i love it so much the map is one of the best out there and there s a reason it s used when judging the maps of new games online is a completely different story it s toxic and pay to win it s fun with friends but random lobbies are awful overall gta v is a 5 5 there s really nothing that can bring down the score
