2022 i enjoy this i think in the beginning the game was a little rough dropped it for a few months but as of july 2022 i like it a lot of people are upset about the lack of immortal empires and i understand that its a great way to play but to be honest i only played immortal empires with friends in tww2 so my enjoyment hasn t been impacted the current campaign promotes defensive strategies and securing your borders the relationships with your neighbors matter more than the previous vortex campaign from tww2 if you play total war in single player mostly then i recommend it based on the updates their team has been pushing you should expect things to get better tldr this game is fun i like it and it ll probably get even better with time based off the updates
