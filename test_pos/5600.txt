2022 i only ever heard of this game and thought it was about lgbt awareness cause of the rainbow but then i realised it was an fps which i am also into and wanted to find an alternative to overw tch censored cause idk it might be triggering to some people to mention that game i find that r6 requires a lot more scheming and calculative action rather than just mindless shooting and i think it s what makes it more rewarding the learning curve is steep but it s very fun and makes me feel something when my adrenaline goes up so at least i know i m not really that dead inside and i have a little bit of brain cells ubisoft needs to fix their ui though other than that pretty good game i would give it a solid 1 2 7 4 9 8 2 10
