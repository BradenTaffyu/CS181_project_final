2021 product received for free 8 10 naraka bladepoint is a really interesting battle royale game instead of the current gunfight battle royale they try to make a game that is mainly based on melee cold weapons most of the ranged weapons in this game are inferior to the melee weapon combat to make this game different the system of this game is very attractive the graph is not bad the optimization of the game is fairly plausible the music on the main menu and the music cut in during the battle are very good too however we can not ignore the shortcomings of this game for now there is only one map in this game not good for keeping the enthusiasm of the players for the first 20 or 30 hours you may find this game is really interesting however after you know how this game work you will find that each round of this game sometime is a little similar however i think the developer still could fix it and i just hope that netease would not screw it up this game is impressive but for now maybe still needs to be polished unless you want to try this game now maybe waiting for the patch is a good choice which edition of this game you should purchase is also an important thing for you to consider as many people reflect that the dlc of this game sometimes does not work even if you purchase them
