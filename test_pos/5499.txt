2016 discord love this game but to be honest it will never be as good as classic rainbow six series it just doesn t feel the same at all there are some issues with playing against people with high pings the high ping people actually have the advantage its weird matchmaking is all over the place but its a work in progress i guess 2019 update i gave up on it 2 years ago already its gotten way too esport kid like tom clancy is spinning right now i mean its great for what it is but don t get it thinking it will be anything like any other real r6 title
