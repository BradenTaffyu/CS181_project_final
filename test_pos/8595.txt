2017 early access review pretty neat tool i was able to create some decent active wallpapers with clickteam fusion before but this little piece of software makes it a lot easier plus that it has a workshop and a ton of wallpapers you can download only minor negative thing atm is that the workshop is more or less spammed with anime and japanese stuff but there are still some other nice wallpapers on the workshop if you dig through the list if you are a fan of anime and are japanese then i guess this would actually be a positive thing
