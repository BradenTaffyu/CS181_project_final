i absolutely loved the 1st dd and was so excited to hear it was finally getting a sequel however i was pretty deflated when it came out and got slammed with negative reviews and i nearly avoided buying it altogether well i m glad i didn t listen and decided to purchase it anyway it is everything i enjoy about dd and other action adventure rpg s and more the world is massive and immersive and exploring it all is almost always rewarding the player customization is nearly endless and offers a ton of different ways to play finally the combat is incredibly engaging and exciting and will constantly set you up with epic and memorable encounters sure the trademark capcom silliness is there at times with the story and it s characters but you should already know what you re getting yourself into when you load up a capcom game in my experience the negative comments that have bogged down this game s reviews have been unfounded micro transactions don t pay for them and play the game normally every single item can be acquired in game relatively easily as you go frame rate drops maybe i m just me but the minor drops i ve experienced are not only not game breaking they are barely noticeable in most cases they have not hindered my enjoyment in any way so if you loved dd and want more of it this game will likely scratch the itch if the original didn t click with you or you re on the fence you may want wait until it goes on sale or skip it altogether but in my opinion you ll be missing out on an amazing experience
