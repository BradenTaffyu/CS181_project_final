2023 rainbow six siege is one of my favourite multiplayer games it s atmosphere and action really shows how far we ve come in technology i own and have played both rainbow six vegas 1 2 and i feel that they implemented a different take onto the rainbow six series and made it into a multiplayer game i originally owned the game on xbox and spent near over 200 hours on the game only last year i had decided to come back to siege and play it again but now on pc which is what i now use to play all my games luckily for those like me who had a level 60 account and owned a lot of the operators can transfer it to pc by simply linking the same ubisoft account you used on your xbox it does take a day or two to fully link but it s all good one you have it i cannot recommend siege enough as it is still to this day argubly one of the most popular multiplayer shooters
