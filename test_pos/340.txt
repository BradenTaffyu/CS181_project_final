2022 coming from someone who was a teenager when atari s were the go to gaming system i ve seen video games evolve from 2 d pixels to full blown reality i first heard about counter strike after i found out about the orange box on my x box console which led me to finding out about counter strike source which i later got to experience on my buds pc this led me to creating a steam account i really enjoyed css and even got into a group of experienced players every weekend we would all get together with other semi competitive groups to play against each other fast forward a decade after lots of health issues and family problems i started getting back into video games and come to find out about counter strike global offensive seeing the new and improved versions of the maps and bombsites we used to spar for really kick started my interest in playing again fast forward i bought myself a powerful computer and created a new account after spending weeks trying to recollect my old login in my now not so sharp brain haha to sum it up this game has really helped a old man enjoy his days and feel young again thank you
