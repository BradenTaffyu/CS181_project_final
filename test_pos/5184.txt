2021 this game is kind of a mixed bag for me i think the golden age of the game is at 2018 19 gameplay is unique the designs of the operators are fun without being too out there for a rainbow six game and there are two new operators a new map and new guns every season the game was balanced and changes are made only when needed it was when i spent the most time in the game but after that things kinda went downhill with only one new operator each season with sci fi level designs next to none new weapons bunch of whatever new gadgets an unnecessary amount of map reworks questionable nerfs and buffs and weird story element i just care less and less about the game don t get me wrong the gameplay is fundamentally still siege and it is undoubtedly fun but i think the new dev team kinda blew what the original team established for new players i would still recommend it because of how different this game offers gameplay wise comparing to other fps titles but it is probably time for us the older players to move on
