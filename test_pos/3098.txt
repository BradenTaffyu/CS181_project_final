2015 a very good game i am a fan of grand theft auto since gta 3 and each time it is a good surprise they do not release one game per year but it is better because the games comes out polished you will rediscover that caustic humor mixed with preposterous stories of gta s universe solo mode is approximately 30 hours if you focus the main storyline but after that you will still be at 60 in your overall game progression cinematics mix really well with the gameplay and the fact that you are allowed to change characters almost whenever you want is a refreshing option i had a lot of fun as well in multiplayer with my friends
