2017 some of the cod fans were like come on cod you gota try something different right now they did it and those some fans again were like go back to your roots lol really well apart from that at first this game got lots of hatred then people started to love it with a bit of hate that s how it works specially for this game this game just the zombies alone worth it but split screen yes treyarch did it for us 3 mods supported and more to come dlcs you see this game got mixed and negative reviews when they released it officially but devs never got rid of it instead they kept this game alive by giving us constant updates and new contents that s how devs should be 3 and now there are fair numbers of players few more plus points including well optimized mod support remastered zombie maps alternate endings well designed display menu options that s more than enough for me to enjoy the game
