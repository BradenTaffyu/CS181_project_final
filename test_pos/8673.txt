2017 early access review amazing addition for your desktop lots of fun to play with and thousand of different wallpapers to choose from i really enjoy using it and im not thinking about dropping it like ever most of the pcs this day should run this no problem dpros wide variety to choose from simply makes your desktop look soo much better simple to use cons users really need to stop uploading simple snowfilters on top of normal wallpapers it s okay if they re christmas based but i even saw summer themes with snow falling and nothing but the snow was animated you come across tons of anime openings or simple youtube videos which i don t really get who wants to use a youtube video as a wallpaper i well i guess that s up to everyone themselfs overall this is a beautiful idea and works really well di ve been searching for something like this for several years now and this one is super simple and easily worth the price
