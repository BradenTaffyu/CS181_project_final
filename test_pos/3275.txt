2021 of course this is a good game an amazing game on playstation and xbox and could have also been as good and sick on pc the campaign is one of the best campaigns that i ve ever played it is hands down in my top 3 campaign experiences however the multiplayer had the golden ticket with an almost perfect world for a mmo the best circumstances for the human reflection on crime murder drugs taboo and money but why work and grind towards anything in this game when you stay in any lobby long enough you encounter a game breaking hacker and that s the blatant ones there are many more modding and abusing the game without your sight as somebody who has played his fair share of multiplayer games i do not understand what rockstar is doing they could easily have fixed most of the problems before they launched the game for example making it so that money is tracked so nobody can hack in money in world of warcraft there are no money hackers there are bots on markets and chinese people farming money but money can t simply be modded in the game you sit there spending hours farming grinding and for what money that could have been modded in seconds and hundred of thousands in this game have some modded money might be from the early anarchy days or later this game has given me some of my favourites gaming experiences with my gaming library not being the same without it it is the perfect scenario for a game and it deliveries in plenty of departments nevertheless i cannot enjoy this game at the level of other games anymore every single lobby which has some players in it will get a modder in an hour or two a lot times much faster than that essential game for my library and i do recommend the game but know what you are buying they don t care about pc gamers and this is a much better experience on consoles 7 10
