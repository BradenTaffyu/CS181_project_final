i enjoy the game a lot gameplay wise it is basically what it says on the tin dragon s dogma and for everyone who wanted more dragon s dogma after finishing dragon s dogma dark arisen you will certainly be getting it with dragon s dogma 2 so i can easily recommend the game for people who enjoyed the first game that is the short of itif you come into the game expecting it to be dark souls monster hunter the witcher baldur s gate or anything else then you are going to be disappointed it is not any of those games it is dragon s dogma just like it says in the title maybe there are other games like dragon s dogma but in that case i have never played them so i do not have any good point of reference to compare it toand if you have not played dragon s dogma why in the world are you shelling out 70 for the sequel go and play the first game the story may be standalone in dd2 but the setting and context for it builds on first game more importantly ddda is a fantastic game in its own rightpositivessolid gameplay foundation and loop lots of different vocations to try and a lot of different approaches can be taken in combat similar to the previous game the mechanics and feel of the battles is an arpg at its height the grappling and climbing on bigger enemies is a high point for me especiallythe pawn system is what really sets the game apart from others in the genre and one of my favorite novel systems in the franchise you create an npc sidekick which follows you around on your journey and helps you to the best of its ability this npc can also be rented to other players on the network similarly you might want to hire pawns from other players to give yourself an edge in combat to help with quests or just to translate idiotic elven babble for youlike in the original the setting is also deceptively different from its first appearances and presentation as high fantasy slop it uses themes and subject matter from mythology religion and philosophy that it is rare to see in a game like this and you might not expect unfortunately the forays into these themes are typically pretty surface level compared to the original which was not very in depth in the first placethe setting and worldbuilding also integrates a lot of the more game mechanical aspects of dragon s dogma pretty stylishly and seamlessly sewing crunch mechanics into the fluff of the worldbuilding makes it deceptively easy to get immersed into what is actually a completely goofy and insane setting if you spend more than a few seconds thinking about it i also love the use of archaic english to sell the medieval setting and i get to learn that domain and jail were at some point written demesne and gaol as a bonusnegativesit does have a lot of shortfalls i think a lot of people who played the first game were hoping that dd2 might have released in a more finished state than the first game unfortunately it does not seem to be the case a lot of the content is half baked a lot of ideas were started but left unfinished is a sense i get with a lot of the content in the gameat the same time the game feels notably less ambitious than the first game the story and ideas around the narrative are also a lot more standard fare than previously this is probably my biggest complaint about the game i would have preferred an overly ambitious game like the previous installment even if it meant it would fail to deliver on a lot more ideas at least then you can lament the missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential by cutting its own ambition short in the sequel the game has in my mind limited its potential in the first placethis is also felt in a lot of the narrative worldbuilding ideas which i found cool about the first game such as the everfall infinite parallel worlds cyclical time will volition as the driving force of the world are either left out glossed over or unceremoniously mentioned in passing before being written off as if from a checklist if i played dd2 before ddda i would be thoroughly unimpressed by the setting which is a shamei would say the narrative of the game is still a cut above your regular high fantasy slop but just barely there is a reveal at the end of the game but it is something of a hidden ending that you might have trouble figuring out by yourself without being familiar with the first game note on microtransactionsabout the same story as with ddda you can pay extra to get readily available in game items there is no reason to do this and it does not give you any real advantage over just playing the game normallymy suspicion is that the mtx are reluctantly included in the release of the game as a way to mollify capcom shareholders with the predictable outcome of souring the game for a lot of potential buyers instead note on performancei can only speak for my own setup but i did initially have some performance issues these were relatively easy to rectify howeverif you are having issues with performance try disabling dynamic resolution and fidelityfx super resolution after i disabled these options the game not only ran a lot better but also looked a lot betterthe game as it is runs butter smooth on the high preset for my midrange desktop 1080p rx 6700 xt ryzen 5 1600x and 32gb of ram i understood your mileage may vary a lot depending on your setup and for a lot of people playing the game without ray tracing and 4k is out of the question if you can settle for 1080p then likely you will be just fine with a midrange buildfinally hire my pawn id ylxo7ea22ylb wolves hunt in
