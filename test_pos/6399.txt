2016 a horror multiplayer only game of 1v4 on the concept of cat and mouse whereas the mouse don t exactly fight back the game is really fun to play however suffers from issues and problems that needs to be sorted out for the value of what you get it is a very enjoyable game for those who are into it and will need more in order to retain its audience in the future video review youtube video dead by daylight review views 2 052 whew spent so many hours on this great fun game though needs some bug squash fixes some tweaks and more the concept is still fun twitch pros the atmosphere of the game and immersion whether you play the killer and get pumped to search out your prey or prepare to get scared silly as a survivor great selection of perks and itemization and the unlocking web choice behind it once you get higher level it starts blacking out certain parts sof the tree so you ll have to make choices items and mods will carry with you if you escape with whatever is left of it gameplay mechanic and rules are fun and rather well implemented great sounds effects and music to keep you on your toe the amount of hours you ll invest for the fun you ll get if you enjoy these type of games cons rebindable keys are missing multiplayer lobby bugs friend party system not working collision problems thesea re being sorted out in a patch will remove when it is done no graphic options tweaking proximity chat would be nice one where the killer can hear your characters and sort you out but without it the survivors are all completely muted it is quite dumb to tell someone to heal you by constantly crouching down in front of them and they balance tweaks needs to be done especially a bit more on wraith which defeats the purpose of the heartbeat meterthe wraith is way too easy to master and use even against a moderate to skillful teams of survivor you will lose one person or even everyone unless the wraith is really bad hook camping is a mechanic being used 95 of the games and needs to be tweaked out a good killer will always camp one person and there will be almost no chance to save them without being hurt or grabbed in which case it makes it almost impossible for a survivor to save that person unless he risks it this causes a domino effect where people will completely ignore other survivor 98 of the game with no incentive to save them even if you do give them the signals window cheesing still exist in the game some buildings has 3 windows and there is no way you can catch a fast survivor no matter how you try to outsmart them and also outmanuever them they can go through windows faster than you can even catch up to them survivors can disconnect games disconnecting survivors get win killers spoils the points for survivors need a cheat implementation as i am hearing talks that it has started although i haven t encountered any steam vac would be great last but not least the godamn flashlights are so useless even with addons and pointing directly in a killer s eyes i ve only accomplished this twice if the killer doesn t angle his camera a bit but it is so easily avoidable also as killer even the maps are more useful these are all the issues i really have with the game so far which weighs outthe pros a bit in my review to be honest and things that can be or will be fixed in the future but i have spent hours and hours on this game and actually enjoy it for the concept and the sheer weight of being pumped as a survivor when the heartbeat meters go off or when i am after them that i am doing it for the mighty blood god looking forward to more killers maps abilities and variety of game modes but for the price of 16 bucks i am not complaining too much
