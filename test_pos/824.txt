2014 really fantastic and balanced game and think about the competetive aspects you could compete queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect even if you have 10 0 stats if you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game else you would be confused about cyka bliat vodka vodka your mother is a bieeeep do you like arabians better be friendly to them because teamkilling is what they stand for matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games enjoy your bot people get random matchmaking bans because they can t reconnect due to bugs you have to decide what player you are you have 2 options you can be the noob or the hacker as noob you basically have worse than 1 0 kd as hacker you are above 1 0kd pretty simple isnt it oh and if you meet people who are global elite after 20 hours playtime dont be afraid its okay the boy girl isjust playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts i can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your iq is below 70 or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster rapper screaming in your ears this game could be for you if you arent sure yet if you should buy this just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs go its awesome you see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat you are all noobs buhahahahahah and honestly who would want to miss something like that if the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3 4 years buy it right now
