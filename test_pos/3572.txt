2018 first of all i m not new to this game so i would love to write a review as i ve played gta v on multiple platformsbut i do genuinely love this game i loved to play it on xbox with friends and it s just as fun now with even more stuff to do and more ways to earn money it just has great replay abilityunfortunately this game is really ruined when it comes to public lobbies being modded and when you come across cheaters it does ruin the experience for most new players but if you bypass all the modders and cheaters you can t really say much bad about this game as long as your with friends this game is a lot of fun but even without friends i ve come to realise that playing with randoms is just as fun definitely would recommend plus if you re into a grind type of game i would say this requires quite a bit of grind to get everything you want
