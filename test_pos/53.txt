prefaceever experience one of those moments in life when you re thankful to have lived long enough to witness an event honestly i am blown away by the quality of black myth wukong and after completing chapter 1 in full i can wholeheartedly say it is one of the most polished games in recent years to carry on the torch toward another golden age of gaming an era in which we can say no to delusional propaganda led by the woke crowd and truly immerse ourselves in masterful storytelling and peak gameplay positivesenriched storytellinga unique take on an existing mythological tale great storytelling in post 2020 media is a rare breed and black myth wukong brings back a practice that many have forgotten in the past decade the ancient art of show don t tell as a result a player with more than half a brain cell becomes intrigued piqued with curiosity as to where the journey will take us next that very simple step that produces the foundation of a great game in and of itself is something many fail to do in this generation hence a praiseworthy achievement a realm to visit more than oncefrom the first cutscene to being dropped into the world as an unknown adventure taking on the mantle of the hero wukong the environment takes your breath away there is an ever so subtle ambience that is neither noisy nor silent overwhelming nor underwhelming neither raging nor soothing to the senses it is the perfect balance of making you feel like you want to stay there forever yet progress to see what comes next the mob enemies you come across are not as threatening as you may think but provide a challenge once you approach bosses have a variety of moves and behaviors that allows you to enjoy the interaction throughout the grueling battles and they re not mindbogglingly difficult enough to make you throw your controller out the window the level of detail and quality placed into each animation of both the character and enemies down to the simple action of opening a chest to find new gear items shows the amount of love and passion that went into this project depth progressionas with storytelling the character progression in the game is less so about wanting to become stronger but rather a sense of wanting to see what comes next in your journey the other myriad of games i ve played over the past few years have molded me into an elitist player one who always min maxes when he can to reach the endgame as quickly as possible before anyone else to play god every now and then however i come across a game that i go into with a different mindset a mindset that allows me to slow down take a breath and enjoy the journey rather than seek the end result in a heartbeat two heartbeats rather than one the difference is astounding when it comes to the human mind absence of woke propaganda nonsensewhenever i browse the internet in any form i grieve at the thought of how the woke propaganda is contaminating our minds day by day trying to brainwash the normal human mentality with ideas of delusion to make the abnormal a norm by forcefeeding outrageous ideas down our throats black myth wukong in all of its so called controversies takes a step closer to our roots not toxic masculinity not sexism not lack of diversity just a pure journey that rids our bodies and minds of any sense of superiority inferiority representation diversity abnormalities delusion or any of that other nonsense this is a game in all of its glory that takes us back to the roots of a character that embarks on a journey that s it nothing more nothing less and i m all for more of it in the years decades to come negativesinvisible wall implementationso this one s a bit of a divisive issue most open world games implement an invisible wall feature to block off players from areas that are in the world but inaccessible in game primarily to help with immersion black myth wukong does this flawlessly to make it so the world is there in its entirety with no questionable areas whatsoever enough so that it s impossible to tell which parts of the world are accessible and which are not this is one of those rare situations wherein if the player would really benefit from a map that at least displays the general area but add to the fact that there is no map to refer to it can get annoying when exploring for chests and or spirits the reason this might be an arguable pro con is that most game companies have been getting flack during the past few years for spoonfeeding players to go here and there with an overly complicated and detailed map ui i m looking at you ubisoft games like elden ring had a natural flow to exploration with the use of a map so players can just have a general idea of where they are black myth wukong took exploration to even higher levels of letting the player have the freedom to do what he wants yet some may argue that in this case the use of clear invisible walls might have helped ironically conclusionfinal verdict a nowadays a game doesn t have to be perfect or even called superb to be worthy of praise so many games drop the ball fast and hard trying to stick political agenda into video games or going for greedy live service routes that don t last more than a few months gamers may need to touch grass sometimes but we re not always stupid or braindead either above all we re a customer base looking to buy a product that provides enjoyment the return of the singleplayer game with a strong foundation of lore and gameplay is what i believe put the gaming industry on the map in the first place and now that the industry has tried its hand in so many possible paths to try to find the perfect route to a stable era of gaming titles like elden ring nioh ghost of tsushima and now black myth wukong have proven time and time again that the single player action rpg has once again laid a solid foundation to the path that truly satisfies the core audience
