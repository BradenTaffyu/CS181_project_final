unexpected masterpiecethis is probably a blueprint on how to make god based mythology action game versatility is their core yet many games in similar god based epic tend to be more human like god of war still on chapter 3 and am already level 54 and 60 is max level after reaching level 74 there s no level cap because gods don t need caps lol this game does everything right i cannot recommend enough story is very motivational despite not having to know much in chinese mythology this gameplay loop and ease of respec ing the character at any time without cost are how gods demi gods should be portrayed they re all rounders and they pick choose every single asset with need of application in mind i love how everything has multiple skill build based attribute tldr easy 9 5 10 10 after reaching chapter 6 and doing almost all secret bosses this is bare minimum 10 10 lol
