2015 ok let s start off here i have no issues with performance and the game is perfectly smooth other then the occasional stutter or whatever it may be the dedis are fine i havent experienced any lag whatsoever as far as that it s a new release there s gonna be bugs there s gonna be issues and it makes me sort of sad to see all these bad reviews about game performance when the game itself is perfectly fine no one understands developers have to be able to optimize the game for the millions of different hardware configurations out and it does take time most of the time but i ve noticed most people are complaining the game isnt optimized and they re trying to run it on high settings with a 650 and other lower end cards and 70 of those bad reviews are generally due to people not understand how textures work i have a 4770k and a 980 strix the game uses a little over 3gb for me with high textures therefore anyone trying to do that on low end cards with less then 3gb of vram just arent going to get good performance it simply wont work with any game it s not the devs fault for that the game is amazing one of my fav cods so far and i tend to only like treyarch games recently anyway as they re always the best optimized and fit my playstyle but patches will come the game will get better
