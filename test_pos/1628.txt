2023 i was in a tomb kings mortal empires campaign on whii when i bought warhammer iii i started the same campaign to compare the difference was instantly noticeable especially in terms of the diplomacy system the improvements are so significant that going back to whii felt like a step backward the diplomacy in whiii actually makes sense now outposts makes complete sense in the context of the game whether you re building them yourself or getting them from allies it adds an extra layer to the strategy and alliances the quality of life improvements are also great things like auto building and an easier level up system have made the gameplay smoother however there s still no auto level up feature which is a shame but hey middenheim wasn t built in a day right the game world is also significantly larger this time around which is a massive plus there s so much more to explore and conquer adding to the depth and longevity of the game that being said the campaign map leaves much to be desired in terms of performance it s not as big of a deal as some people make it out to be but it s certainly not a highlight of the game while the map struggles to maintain 40 50 fps the battles are a different story altogether the battles run at a crisp 60 fps making each clash a visually stunning spectacle so far i had one crash during my battle one that stopped happening once i disabled control by ai for my alliance army in the grand scheme of things warhammer iii is a huge step forward for the franchise despite its flaws it s a game that i wholeheartedly recommend and i would now finally recommend as the only game to get for a newbie out of the 3 in the series i d wait for a discount since the price is steep but it does offer a ton of content looking forward to the future updates and improvements edit turns out there is auto level up feature in the top left corner of each character
