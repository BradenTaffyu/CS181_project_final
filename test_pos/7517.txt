i don t even know how to describe this game in a way that someone else hasn t this is probably the most enthralled i ve ever been in any game ever i ve never been big into pirates in general i ve watched a bit of one piece played ac4 and tried the aaaa game known as skull and bones but never really got huge into it when it went on sale my friend picked up a copy for me and him he played a bit on xbox and wanted some people to play with all of a sudden it s been 5 days and i have 55 hours in this game if you aren t great at math that s almost 11 hours spent playing every day and i have no thoughts about stopping yet i eat breathe and sleep this game i will close the game and actually have sea legs i ve never been so immersed and enthralled by a game to this degree i think i m going to reach pirate legend within the next couple of weeks and this is coming from someone who doesn t even like pirates
