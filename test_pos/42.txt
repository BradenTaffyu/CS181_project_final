very good game runs well i like the boss fights there s a lot of them i would like to say more about the game s narrative in which so little people are discussing the story is a very good twist to the wukong narrative which has the protagonist journey through different places to gather the 6 relics of the great sage sun wukong to bring him back from the dead each chapter feels like a philosophical buddhist dialogue about characters that have failed to follow in the steps of buddha due to their earthly nature there are beautiful movie shorts that play at the end of each chapter that adds a layer of narrative to the characters and the places you visit best way to describe it is like if elden ring showed you a movie before everything went to theres also a mural with an old wise man narrator making philosophical commentary on the tragic characters that you meet and fight during your journey which is a really nice touch there is some humour to be found that these characters are in stark contrast to wukong s effortless attainment of buddhahood in which he later regretted due to having missed the simple joys of life this fuels the thematic conflict that is pervasive in this game man s desire to transcend the earth and escape the tragedy of this world as opposed to giving in to earthly desires and all the things both good and bad attached to it this is a very tonally consistent game with a very subtle introspective emotional delivery similar to elden ring music is used at a minimum here with it only really playing during boss fights despite music not being used often it is effective when it is especially in chapter 2 it is so unlike western games that are more overt with its delivery of narrative mood games like god of war 2016 uses music more heavily and changes mood according to the scene being showed it also easy to tell when scenes in god of war are trying to be humorous due to me knowing the language in wukong it is very hard to tell the humour apart due to me not knowing chinese language and culture i can tell people will have a different experience of this game whether if you re from china or not but this is just how the game made me feel i played the game in english va to really get the emotional aspect that the narrative is trying to deliver whether it is true to the chinese vibe i do not know all in all it is a very fun game 9 10
