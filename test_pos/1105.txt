three stages of playing elden ring 1 learning these boss attacks are bullsh t they are too quick there is no way to avoid them what were they thinking when they designed this 2 20 deaths complete silence while dodging attacks after getting familiar with bosses patterns 3 post boss clarity that had to have been one of the greatest fights i ve beaten what an incredible design elden ring was my first fromsoftware title and my initial response to this game design was to reject it but in all honesty this game taught me that determination and willingness to put effort into overcoming an obstacle are always possible if you put your mind into it but if not and if you are struggling to beat certain pieces of content the game allows you to overcome those obstacles with variety of other tools which is a great thing overall a solid 8 out of 10 from me imperfect but an incredibly fun game
