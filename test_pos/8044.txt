2022 short reviewthe base experience is very fun unforgiving and a good sandbox roguelike technically lite i guess experience beyond that however i find that the game can sort of fall off and become really repetitive convoluted i recommend this game however mainly because i believe that the first few times you realize and explore the world beyond the boundaries the game just changes completely also the large majority of players do not even touch upon the stuff that bothers me so it s unlikely the average player will go far beyond the base experience if you really enjoy uncovering really obscure secrets then this is genuinely the perfect game for you be aware that a lot of the time you re going to die to that is out of your control stuff like a worm breaking into an area and the gods getting angry at you instead for some reason other times you may be even unluckier and some alchemical reaction off screen butterfly effects into something random that ultimately kills you on one occasion i straight up randomly died due to heavy impact despite standing peacefully away from enemies and not seeing anything fall down or hit me going to spoiler some secret quest stuff if you want to figure it out yourself good partsthe spell wand system is incredible it is basically a language that you slowly start to understand while you play and mess around more you will slowly learn how easy it is to become overpowered with just basic spell and or perk combinations there is so so much to explore and understand and it really feels like you are learning something new every single run i really enjoyed the avarice diamond quests in a game about trusting nothing i found some solace in putting the little green guy in the race car and driving all the way to the diamond the feeling of power when you finally do a proper long run is immeasurable you truly and genuinely feel like you have achieved something immense when you finally complete one of the harder longer secrets in the game the game rewards you for breaking it do not feel bad about it even stuff like the heartache hp exploit was kept in and nerfed because the devs liked it despite it being able to bring you over 1k health easily bad weird parts stuff to watch out for too if you reasonably want to achieve something like the completing the sun quest you need to visit a large number of parallel worlds to break the perk reroll machine and achieve all the necessary perks for the incredibly dangerous task obviously you don t need to do this extensive several hour long preparation every single time you want to have a long overpowered run this could be shortened to perhaps an hour if you are just looking to become generally hard to kill instead to be honest this isn t that big of a deal if you re just playing the game without a specific goal but i just find it extremely tedious if i m missing hard to get spells while knowing how easy it is to screw up the progress towards those spells and how you d have to do that all over again mainly because it s not really a challenge it s just kinda like walking window to window until you find a shop selling the thing you want with no real risk present to you at all if you are reasonably cautious the hints for things are semi impossible to figure out on your own unless you have an immense amount of dedication please use the wiki unless finding obscure secrets is your thing anything you don t know or understand has the potential to just end your run instantly and there are way too many things to know too many secrets and too many things you can only learn after it happens for example one boss requires a specific item to killed properly so you bring it with you and throw it on the floor to start attacking the boss while it s vulnerable suddenly the boss just destroys the item mid fight because you placed it too close got unlucky this item only consistently spawns in one specific spot in the entire world if you did not know this beforehand you would have to explore the rest of the world until you find that specific item again as a random chest drop and then challenge the boss again while being a bit more careful this ties in to what i believe to be the biggest issue of this game it doesn t really feel like a game at times instead it feels like some weird social experiment i assume this is reminiscent of older games where players collectively work together to uncover the secrets except the scale is far larger because of player hosted wikis and etc it just kinda feels like a waste though the game is rated overwhelmingly positive yet only 10 of players beat the game and 0 2 of players have uncovered all the spells enemies which means they personally witnessed a majority of the secrets why is the game hiding so much more cool content outside of the main game instead of making it part of the main game this is their design choice and respect is to be had for the level of detail put in the world and its secrets but a lot of this stuff is convoluted and it feels like it would have been a lot more enjoyable fulfilling for the individual player if we didn t have to scan the wiki to find out the secrets lore in a reasonable amount of time the noita discord probably went ham on the secrets though another thing to note is that parallel worlds dramatically increases the size of your save file and make it increasingly unstable especially when you are searching for spells to complete your progress for example i visited over a hundred parallel worlds using a wand built for this purpose so i didn t walk there trying to find a single spell for 4 5 hours and my save file increased to 1 2gb in size i did not find the spell i later found out it was bugged and i had to manually fix the issue to get the spell in a new game a prior run simply to get reasonably overpowered got my save file to around 500mb in size i did not notice any issues with the world loading until i hit over 1gb on the other hand the game itself can crash break quite easily i ve had all holy mountains disappear from the world the pyramid disappeared too idk and other times the background images disappeared too like the interiors of cabins the entrance cave etc during these longer runs it is a bit odd how visiting these places is considered mandatory for more difficult content by the community but the game itself cannot really handle it sometimes another time i placed some items in a specific spot in the desert in preparation for a quest only to come back and see the items completely gone no idea what happened there just be prepared to make saves restart the game often because it is completely possible something can just break randomly and ruin your run i probably would not have been so annoyed with my runs if it weren t for that also if you want to use really powerful wands please at least invest in a good pc i have a decent pc but the game will sometimes just turn into a stop motion animation when several of my perks domino effect each other 10 times a second
