the tldr version is yes this is a good game but definitely not as great as everyone is making it out to be looks amazing it s well optimised compared to most crap on the market these days and combat is mostly fun but that s about where it stops for me in summary if you are simply looking for a fast paced martial arts samurai style game and don t really care about it being new or hyped i would recommend sekiro shadows die twice over this any day here is why the long version as a from software fanboy and a souls like veteran i was excited to see something new and fresh to the genre and something that may have been able to compete with the aforementioned sekiro black myth wukong starts off strong but you quickly start to learn all the nuances about the game that make it down right frustrating and for lack of a better word crap here is the list invisible walls that stop you from exploring areas that look reachable it gets old really fast there may be a cultural barrier but the story is simply confusing disjointed and doesn t really make sense it is filled with so much random crap that i stopped caring and started skipping most of the cut scenes not to mention some of the really annoying side characters i got the main premise of it but man it was a slog to get through the combat is fast and entertaining but i would not call it crisp or skill based without writing a 20 page essay on why just know that you will get ripped off many times with missed button presses interrupted moves bulls t enemy move sets unavoidable aoe and just flat out cheating by the bosses i felt like the combat was too luck based to be called well designed there are too many bosses it also gets old real fast not to mention towards mid game they just stop dying being defeated they will often flee or just start some random dialog with you before leaving the satisfaction of ass kicking gets taken away from you traversal is tedious and sometimes gets you killed there is a type of auto mantle feature that sometimes forces you to jump down ledges you didn t want to some of the spawn points are really far from the arena where you died and running there is really annoying gear progression in summary there is a lot of stuff to acquire in this game but a lot of it feels really pointless gear progression is flat out enraging for example there is one armour set that you unlock for crafting quite early but you don t find all of the materials until much later in the story progression if you are a completionist like me it took roughly 20 hours or more to finally craft it yes i could have skipped a bunch of stuff and got the materials but that many hours is just ridiculous i kept thinking to myself oh yeah it can t be far off now this also carries over to upgrading another slogfest to get high end materials gear progression cont when you finally do get a piece of gear that you think is going to be amazing it usually comes with a negative effect or such a small benefit that just makes it not worth it equipping the game forces you into certain gear for the set bonuses and towards the late game you just end up using whatever is best in the late game you get a bunch of different gear that gets thrown at you and makes you wonder why you spent your hard earned money materials on the other crap yes you can make random builds but they are very limited if you actually want to be powerful the skill progression is quite good but also has some pointless aspects to it you have 3 different stances for combat but the gear is usually focused around one of them making it utterly pointless to switch between them again focusing you into whichever is best for the time same goes for your sub items as well usually focusing on one particular skill or spell that makes the others pointless the fact that re specing is free and easy is a really good part of this game but honestly i just ran the whole game with one stance at a time it feels like the game wants you to experiment with different builds and skills but it is just not worth it to finalise i really struggled to recommend this game but i have a personal rule that if i have a decent amount of hours or have completed it it must have been worth it if you are expecting crisp skill based combat like some other games in similar genres i would not recommend this you will end up breaking something it is a really good game from a developer s first big title but they missed the mark on so many things that it just made it frustrating to play for me it s almost like they tried to hard and added a lot of unnecessary crap which just ends up conflicting with enjoying the game anyway sorry to ramble but i felt it needed to be said people are praising this game way too hard
