2018 tom clancy s rainbow six siege has become one of my favourite fps as of now also my most played as well when i first started playing this game i was a complete noob infact it took me a lot of time to actually get average in this game it was kinda frustrating at first but nevertheless i really enjoyed the game as there are like a million ways through which we can approach our objective and every kill victory feels rewarding it feels brilliant when you timed correctly throw detonate a c4 on the hatch upon which there is a fuze waiting to deploy his cluster charge and get killed himself the destructible environment in the game allows many ways possibilities through which we can approach our objective kill enemies etc adding more variety to the gameplay mechanics it s perhaps the best fps in my opinion here are some of it s pros and cons pros destructible environment cqc makes the player s approach more varied and interesting pretty good soundtracks though its main theme is okay but soundtracks from certain maps like clubhouse and the house feels damn electricfying to me b though it has no single player campaign but the operator s voice acting videos etc are very well made this adds more value and story elements to these characters now this might be personal but its graphics style and art reminds me of some old school games like igi 2 etc i feel relaxed and chilled while playing it cons dlc ops prices are a bit too high though i have the standard edition and have unlocked quite a lot of ops but it will be pretty cool if there can be some occasional discounts on the prices though it doesn t bother me very much but for starter edition users its actually a big cons considering you don t like grinding thus i ll like to conclude that it s perhaps one of the best fps currently on the market it offers a refreshing and intelligent gameplay with tons of fun and satisfaction as well as continued support of the devs publisher ubisoft montreal and ubisoft
