2021 the game is great this is the only battle royale i ve enjoyed other than pubg matches go quite fast there s a lot of battles and the movement is smooth the heroes abilities and ultimates make the game unique and interesting as well it s great that this game has a respawn function and knock down shields that prevent you from getting removed from a match too fast and easily pathfinder s personality is awesome also god bless loba s butt 3
