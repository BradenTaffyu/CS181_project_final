2014 my brother is an avid amateur chess player that s how he describes himself when making small talk you should see his room it s full of dumb chess pieces from different sets like his favorite gold pawn it s not really gold but he claims it is nobody believes him so anyway one time i went to his room and i saw a new addition to his collection it was a giant paper mache bishop like 3 feet tall he obviously made it himself because it was crooked and i saw yesterday s news on the bishop s belly but what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head the whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle so approached the artifact and i bit the tip off unfortunately for me my brother saw me do it unfortunately for him i move as quick as a fox i was a dancing blur of after image avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me i slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad s room i locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down then i asked myself self what do i do now so i booted my dad s pc which i also use for gaming logged into steam and saw that cs go was on sale i bought it it is an ok game
