2018 any longtime dead by daylight player knows that this isn t a horror game if you re looking for scares i wouldn t consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time it doesn t have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer that said and set aside i enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer s line of sight and giving them the slip it can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock there have been times where i have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it s one of the aspects that drew me to dead by daylight it s a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught on the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting as with any game i feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it s possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun i give dead by daylight an 8 10 and i ve enjoyed my many hours playing and so i will recommend
