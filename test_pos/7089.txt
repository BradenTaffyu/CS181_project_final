2016 black ops 3 isn t a masterpiece but i believe there is fun to be had the campaign is pretty solid with missions that don t follow the cod formula and a moderately interesting story the zombies is a fun addition that gives you a wide variety of tasks to fulfil while adding some new things to the cod zombies lore the multiplayer is pretty fun also some of the maps are well designed and colourful but some of the other maps are really horrible the guns are decent and well balanced the subs and ar s feel very reminiscent of one another though similar damage fire rate and range etc much like last years advanced warfare the exo suit is an unwelcome addition that gets pretty irritating due to players constantly using it to get out of your line of fire none the less the multiplayer is the best and most entertaining it has been since black ops 2 campaign 8 5 10 zombies 8 10 multiplayer 8 10
