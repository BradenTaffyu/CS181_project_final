2019 ok so this is a review strictly for gtao ok alright gtao is like an abusive relationship you get over by everything in this game every 5 minutes but you still keep playing because it s fun the game is constantly playing against you you want to deliver your 2 8 million car for merely 100k yeah yeah sure just let me spawn a couple of enemy npcs that can randomly spawn at any moment quite often literally in your way and drain your car s worth significantly ok don t want to export your super sport cars sure you can do some cargo missions maybe awesome enter your bigblacktruck and start a 3 box mission which is basically a 50 50 chance for a 20 minute deliver mission or a 5 minute delivery mission not that bad to be fair but as i said some of these can be completely cancerous to complete especially if you re new try to take down a valkyrie helicopter with your puny carbine rifle it s not that bad when you have a homing launcher or a sniper maybe but for someone who s new these cargo missions are for all types of players be it new or veteran it can be quite a hassle to complete one of these especially picking them each and deliverin up to 5 miles to your warehouse fine it s annoying but what about heists heists are the selling point for some people in this game yes you do get heist and they re actually great they re fun they re enjoyable though repetetive they are fun when they work unless you have 4 2 for some heists and doomsday ones people for best experience friends they work wonders it s really fun and challenging to go into a huge bunker shoot up some mercs and steal some delicous money but see you probably don t have friends and you try to complete a heist with some randoms well that s where the fun ends because in some way this game has attracted a lot of stupid people who can t even use a keyboard to play the game you could spend literal hours trying to get pass one heist and be amazed at how stupid people can be if you re new please stay away from heists for a while unless you have some friends yeah there are more ways to make money but who cares lol i do kinda freemode money making is a pain if you dont know how to make a solo public lobby i don t want to talk much about this so imagine it as vietnam war with jet bikes that shoot missiles cars that fly cars that shoot missiles and cars that have literally saws on them and you re a poor vietnamese farmer trying to tend to his field even though the game tells you to destroy people s business cargo and like that you get like 2 4k for destroying someone s 3 hours of work do not trust the game in my eyes this is just an advanced trick to tilt players into making them buying shark cards which are majorly overpriced i m just writing this to let people know what they re getting into you see a lot of reviews saying that there s a lot of kd warriors modders kids griefers although its true in my experience they aren t that common as long as you aren t in a 15 lobby you really shouldn t be afraid of people i ve truly met a lot of people who were bad but it wasn t always bad i had people come over and defend me from enemy spawns police or even other players rockstar honestly pleasantly surprised me with the new casino update to sum it up shortly quite a few ways to gamble they are actually quite fun to do i personally really like to play the different games and basically pray to rng gods for a blessing they added new cars a few new missions a penthouse highly customizable and my favourite feature a wheel of fortune where you can win lol this was really good content and a lot of people really did like it but what most didn t expect is rockstar throwing an unexpected curve ball and nerfing some pvp aspects like passive mode which is great
