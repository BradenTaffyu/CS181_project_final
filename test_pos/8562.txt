2022 great wallpaper application for your pc there s a large variety of wallpapers to chose from and you can even make your own with effects clocks and all sorts of other stuff i love how simple it is to make nice wallpapers yourself and publishing them for other people to use is awesome definitely recommend it only thing i advise is to pause any animated wallpapers while you re gaming or doing anything that requires any processing power or ram usage because this bad boy sucks it all up and really hinders performance in literally anything you do other than that it s great
