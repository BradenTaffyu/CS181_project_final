2022 this game is a recommend with a hard but as of patch 1 021 there have been insane complaints from the same reviewers who highly recommended this game that the performance was terrible and was in fact worse than the patch they were given to play and review on i believe this will get fixed and i believe the reviewers who recommended this game didn t lie at all about the strong points of this game when looking past the stuttering in new regions you will see an amazing open world difficult enemies a beginner friendly travel system more difficult enemies loot and more difficult enemies i have not been by any means a fan of the soulsborne series however saw its charm in my quick demo of playing ds3 with that i must say while experiencing and even after experiencing this title i for sure will give the other games a shot the ones without centipedes btw
