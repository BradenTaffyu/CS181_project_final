2022 hey i found a great vegan cookie recipe i d love to see the bakers here try ingredients 1 2 cup coconut oil solid but scoopable1 1 4 cup of light brown sugar2 teaspoons of vanilla extract1 4 cup coconut milk it s suggested you use the thicker thai variety but any coconut milk apparently works 1 4 cup unsweetened aplesauce2 1 3 cups all purpose flour it says be careful not to pack your flour not really sure what that means 1 teaspoon baking soda1 2 teaspoon of salt2 cups of chocolate chips use vegan chocolate chips if vegan flaky sea salt but that s optionalinstruction preheat oven to 375 degrees farenheit line a large baking sheet with parchment paper set aside 2 iin a large bowl whisk together the coconut oil brown sugar and vanilla beatting until well combined add in the coconut milk and aplesauce and wisk until well combined then set aside in a separate bowl combine the flour baking soda and salt whisk well to combine 3 add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and using a wooden spoon or a very sturdy spatula stir until ingrsdients are combined the batter will be very thick fold in 1 3 4 cups of chocolate chips 4 scoop 3 tablespoon sized mounds of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets leaving a few inches between each cookie for spreading bake for 9 to 10 minutes or until the edges are golden and the centers have set press remaining chocolate chips on top of warm cookies and sprinkle with sea sakt if you want cool cookies on the baking sheet for 15 minutes before transfering them to a cooling rackso that s the recipe it also adds as a tip that if the dough appears too sticky add a little more flour one tablespoon at a timne or if the dough appears too dry add a tablespoon of coconut milki d really appreciate it if you could give this a spin and let me know if it s worth trying myself appreciate you drizzy out
