2021 it is so sad to see how a once good game is really dying back in the day i could grind all day and never get tired but now i do not even bother opening it since lots of smart balanced update has been made only my one very best friend is still holding it up so i just wanna say thank you ubisoft though i know they won t even bother thanks for bringing up this fun game years ago we had tons of fun truly and we know at least siege has lived but i guess its just like that everything comes to an end and sometimes you just have to let go
