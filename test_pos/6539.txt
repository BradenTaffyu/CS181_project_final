600 hours honest reviewfirst of all use a ssd nvme m 2 for this game the game is running very smooth 90 130 fps no stutters no input lag clean af i5 13400f32gb ram ddr4 3200 mhzrtx 3060tissd nvme m 2 crucial 1tb pcie gen4 5000 mb s just for games topics what i have in the game for 600 hours free to play microtransactions gameplay drop rates season 1 thoughts tldrlet s go note i ve only purchase the pre season battle pass nothing more with the 300 calibers the pass gives you back i bought 6 descendants slots what i have in the game for 600 hours all descendants except for hailey all ultimate weapons maxed out 5 copies each almost all modules 555 561 4 enzo s short and 2 luna s new modules 17 energy activatos 100 crystallization catalyst full build all sockets catalyzed all modules upgraded activator used for ult bunny ult lepic ult viessa ult gley afterglow thundercage greg s reversed fate python enduring legacy 14kk kuiper 66kk goldfree to play yes it is a free to play game no it s not a pay to win game yes it s a pay to rush game but with some consequences that been said it s a heavy grindy loot n shooter game and it is the only thing to do in the game farm that s what the game goes about to chase something you think you want or need pay to rush consequences if you wanna buy some activatos or cataltysts maybe a descendant or two that s fine but supposing you purchase everything in this game you can just unninstall and find another thing to play because there is nothing more to do if you don t have anything more to farm that s how the current state the game is including season 1 pay to win there is no such elements in the current state of the game that you win anything over another player if you pay something there is no pvp too nothing that you can buy in the shop will give you more power damage to kill mobs and bosses so no it s not a pay to win game microtransactionsnote in fact i think the prices charged in the shop are a bit too high maybe if they were a little more affordable i d be willing to buy some more things full of very nice booty skins makeups cosmetics and so on some conveniece like xp boosters gold boosters etc needed nah you can do fine without boosters descendants packs material packs mehhh slots for descendants presets loudout backpack and storage space i m neutral about the quantity that is given for free could be a little more backpack and storage if i would say gameplay very enjoyable gunplay nice skills well designed characters challenging especially if you don t take some time to build properly many cases that i ve seen people complaining about reaching for hard mode is because they don t care about building their descendant that much and get frustrated by not progressing the game nice voice actors nice graphics super nice soudtrack very repetitive may be an issue for some players but that s what a mmo game styles are extremely satisfying when you get that last 6 piece to craft a new ultimate descendant dopamine goes brrr drop ratestalking about 6 as i stated high above i do have and farmed all descendants and weapons maybe i was lucky maybe it was average drops but i didn t have much problems with rng only 2 descendants pieces that was a pain for me ult bunny enhanced cells took me 46 3 amorphous 009 yes it was in the begining of the game righ after i reached hard difficultie and ult gley spiral catalyst took me 86 6 amorphous 096 to get it everything else was within the statistical probabilities of drop chance season 1 thoughtswith this new season update i ve seen some great improvements in build diversity big improvements on ways to level up descendants superb 5 million gold everyday just for doing 4 invasion missions 25 minutes max to do it didn t like much as how the new descendant hailey materials acquisition were done the new inversion reinforcement really needs some better perks nothing there grasps my attention nice loot filter nice battle supply shop meh battle pass unfortunately nice item icons modifications hailey killing pyromaniac in 5s with only 2 catalysts nice definitely gonna farm her tldr you can have anything in the game besides cosmetics just by playing the game it s not a game for imediatists people you need to spend time on it and it ll be a lot take the pay to win term and go put it on destiny 2 i do have 2k hours there f u bungie microtransactions are a little overpriced but nothing needed to play the game and nothing gives you power damage boost well made game overall nice characters voices soundtrack modelling graphics challenging drop rates are within the statistical probabilities of drop chance sometimes will take you a little bit more amorphous than usual sometimes you ll get a 6 item in the first try season 1 update comes with 90 good things 10 mehh thingsthis is a very new game and i can see how the devs are putting some big efforts to adjust it with players feedbacks way faster than some other titles for now i can recommend this game if you like this playstyle no potatos for long review you can leave now thanks
