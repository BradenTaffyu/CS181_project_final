2019 when you look at this game for the first time you may just see this as some odd looking asymmetrical horror game and wonder how deluded you d have to be to sink thousands of hours into this game like a surprising amount of people haveand even after you play your first few matches and get focused down or tunneled by some weird man setting bear traps everywhere that you seem to get caught in even though you triple checked only 5 seconds ago and you swore to yourself that there wasn t one there you just cant understand what it is about this game that draws such a community to its namebut then you notice all of those shiny red things you seem to be accumulating through your many fruitless deaths and so you decide to open up the bloodweb and you start to turn those useless shiny red things into items and perks that you use to better yourself and your odds of survival until you make that first sweet escapeall of a sudden you start to really see the way the progression works in this game you see it for what it is a long and hard grind but you think about how sweet that first escape was and how you could start levelling up many of your characters to make the ultimate build a build so powerful that the trap setting fool will regret ever coming near you you finally reach the summit you ve spent millions upon millions of those oh so craved bloodpoints you ve learnt the teachables and you ve made your builds and suddenly you realise just why so many people have dedicated such seemingly insane amounts of hours into this little asymmetrical horror gamei m currently on this journey myself with 174 hours i ve unlocked a decent amount of stuff for my killers and my survivors but i m still a long way off thoroughly completing everything there is to do in this game but as someone who is quickly finding new games and dropping old ones and not committing too much to anything this is one of the rare games i can see myself breaking the thousand hour milestone in the gameplay itself is fun with both roles offering a very unique experience with survivors relying on each other to complete their objectives which can also be played with up to 3 friends whereas the killer role is for the lone player who only wants to rely on their own skills to achieve victory killer is by far the more stressful role of the two despite what you may think and is typically more rewarding in terms of bloodpoints however both sides have their pros and cons and its really up to you whether you d prefer to play one role more than the other or whether you d rather just play them both depending on your mood or availability of friends or some other reason and if you re still not convinced that this game may be for you but you re still curious there are a plethora of youtubers and twitch streamers making content about this game all the time so you can always take a look for yourself and see if you think you d like itif you somehow managed to get to the end of this review i never write reviews and now you can probably see why p then thanks and i hope i ve managed to sway you one way or the other about buying this game if you do decide to take the leap into dbd then i hope you enjoy it
