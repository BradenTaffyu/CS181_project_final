2022 this is a reveiw literally the second day after the games full release ill be sure to change it as they improve and update the game there will be spoilers for the campaign first the game currently is a 3 5the campaign is fantastic lots of variety and levels that really suck you in as you pull covert operations or go guns blazing in crazy gunfights a bit disappointing that farah is mentioned for one level hadir or alex are never mentioned or seen questions and concerns from the first game arent really addressed in this game but overall it was a wonderful experience the multiplayeras of posting this 10 29 2022the multi is good most of the maps on release are actually not bad at all i really like the racewway and border checkpoint maps the guns feel good look good even pistols got a bit of love in terms of firepower and range which is nice all of the base ops are unlockable via challenges and theres a great amount of them providing players some personal customization which is great if some really dont want to spend the money of characters when theyre all just cosmetic i also really really like how camos are done know with each gun having four camos which when unlocked through a much simpler camo challenge are unlocked for all guns no longer having to grind every gun out for the same camos over and over and over doing mundane repetitive and sometimes frustrating challenges just to reach the mastery camos one of the biggest problems however is currently the game is having a bit of a glitchy release 1 the game is very prone to crashing i think if youre graphics settings cant meet a requirement sometimes the game just kills itself and i have to sit for up to 10 minutes just waiting for steam to verify the game files for the umpteenth time 2 camos are glitching out i spent all day grinding out the camo challenges excitedly to get the gold camo for the m4 just to see that i am unable to select any of the mastery camos to see if ive unlocked the gold camo challenge3 the voice channels is a very good idea it allows friends playing through crossplay to talk and play together in game so that all parties can still hear the game since things like discord and skype or pc and phone only problems is its broken there were so many times where we kept getting muted after loading into match no matter how we set our vc preference we couldnt hear one person but he could hear us and i was hoping that the vc would be prioritized whether you were loading in or in a match while your friend wasnt he has a ps4 so takes a bit longer to load in but i cant hear or talk to him until hes loading into the match 4 there is a severe lack of content im unsure if maybe iw is waiting until season one before releasing a bunch of content but we are missing quite a bit compared to the beta executions that were seen from most operators in the beta have been removed so that everyone all has the same one i unlocked the beta skin for horangi but am unable to access his base skin so far it seems only the milsim ops have customizable skins there was alot of hype and speculation that a few popular guns such as the honey badger was going to be added to the game but its not there think it was even usable in the campaign but i may have been confused but its likely they removed it from the start of the game to use it as a season 1 weapon so far the game is good but not great its prone to bugs and glitches and breaks and needs a bit more post release polish which i think we all hope to see within the coming weeks and hopefully not having to wait for fixes until nov 16th sorry for the awful review this is my first time writing a legitimate one and i had pretty much know clue how to convey everything clear and concise tell me im stupid if it helps
