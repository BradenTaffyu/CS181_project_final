2017 with nearly a quarter of a million reviews at the time of posting it s hard to say anything about warframe that hasn t already been said warframe is frightfully addictive and once you get over the initial wall of what the hell is going on it can be very hard to put it back down so many of the negative reviews on steam consist of the game has changed or it ruined my life and when you ve sunk so many hundreds of hours into a game i find it somewhat insulting that some people still choose to leave negative reviews on a free game that s not to say warframe is faultless but after earning hundreds of hours of your time it feels like you must ve enjoyed the game at some point warframe is a third person hacky slashy shooter set in space with robot like ninjas that sentence is about as awesome as playing the game and the combat is incredibly satisfyting once you get the hang of it and a few decent weapons many of the characters feel unique albeit with some redundant characters frames cluttering up what could be and still is mostly an impressively diverse roster the same applies to weaponry too missions go through small instances in teams of 1 4 to complete certain objectives whether it be rescuing a target eliminating hostiles or defending a point all missions are somewhat procedurally generated bar the story missions by somewhat i mean you ll start to recognise each room a ton but they can pop up in any order and multiple times i can practically recall every room you can find on pluto excavation hierarchon since that particular mission has taken more hours from me than some entire games have but i digress warframe is enjoyable on three conditions excercise some self control those without willpower may find themselves completely sucked into the world of warframe wallets may empty and lives may crumble it harkens back to the days of everquest and the whole whoops i was mid raid and forgot to feed my baby so self control guys set your own goals those who need a game to tell them exactly what to do will struggle with warframe besides a few story missions that will take a few hours getting strong enough to take them on will require hours of working on building your arsenal through modding your frames and weapons or acquiring new ones this takes time and without a sense of direction i can see players simply going through missions one by one and getting frustrated by difficulty or repetition quickly chill out pick a gun bow sword or whatever and just work towards it it s a slow but rewarding process bring or find some friends warframe can be a lonely place even in groups if you have no one to talk to in a one hour defence mission having some people to laugh with work with and rage with against lech kril why is his hit box for his thing so tiny aaaah will help immensely this game is full of potential a way to earn the supposedly p2w currency through trading bosses raids pets secret powers this game has it all as long as you love doing sweet flips off walls shooting guys in mid air and can keep yourself from going mad this game is potentially timesink gold for anyone looking for a new game to keep themselves occupied warframe is great it s eaten more hours than any game i ve ever played on steam and i can forsee it taking more as they continue to update this already vast game it s worth your time to at least give it a few hours it s free after all so why not
