2022 for reference i have 1500ish hours in tw w2campaign maybe i m in the minority but i actually really like the campaign and changes to siege battles i like how the focus isn t on expanding but on diplomacy and making the right strategic choices at the right time do you go for the soul yourself or thwart the faction in the lead thematically and mechanically i find it superior to the vortex rifts offer up an interesting shake up that makes protecting your inner sanctum of settlements actually worthwhile i loved defending against demonic armies with a t3 defensive garrison and leveraging the reworked siege mechanics to win battles i would have been crushed in however i did find the survival battles to be extremely mentally fatiguing by wave 3 i lost all motivation to continue and just minimized the game overnight luckily you can auto resolve them without much consequence if they were 2 waves i think it would be just right changes changes to diplomacy are extremely welcome the new system is a complete improvement in my opinion alliances are actually worth having and the complex network of alliances between other factions means you need to tread carefully when expanding this is a notably different experience than warhammer 2 where i just kept expanding thoughtlessly the supply lines rework is great and alleviates the reliance on doomstacks in warhammer 2 i had 1 army for as long as i could possibly manage now the threshold is much lower to make a smaller secondary force a host of user interface improvements are present as well the unit and spell encyclopedia is convenient to use and helps make informed decisions spells actually have stats showing damage and armor piercing values no more guessing how good magic is the quick deal feature on diplomacy is a god send and eliminates tedium if you fight battles in a row with the same army the game remembers your deployment from the previous battle and saves you alot of time hero and lord traits for the most part are heavily nerfed from warhammer 2 which is something i prefer since it doesn t promote save scumming or a sense of loss when you don t get a good trait issues there are numerous experience ruining bugs though like disbanding lords doesn t reduce upkeep docked ranged units don t fire etc luckily i have a high end pc but i have to turn resolution down and externally limit the fps to keep my gpu from melting unit pathing is pretty bad it s especially awful with larger units especially ogres the chaos faction rosters are underwhelming extremely fun to use and a nice change of pace but very lacking in variety especially compared to warhammer 2 races who have had multiple dlc s of unit addons and regiments of renown all that said with the sure to be upcoming patches dlc and immortal empires i am positive that there will be nothing to complain about
