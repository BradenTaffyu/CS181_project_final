amazing game great mid game and end game amazing customisation the only thing that needs to be worked on a little is the new player experience very hard to get people into the game very little tutorials or explanations at the start and wait times for mr1 weapons is a bit silly wish they made the first few obtainable warframes and weapons faster to make as it ll keep new players wanting to play i ve invited 4 friends on and only 1 has passed the 50 hour mark early game is pretty boring and bad if anything needs to get updated or fixed its that
