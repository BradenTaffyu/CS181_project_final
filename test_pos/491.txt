2021 counter strike global offensive thankfully remains as counter strike as ever none of what made the series what it is today are absent on the release of course more hardcore players might find something to complain about stuff as absurd as the m4a1 carbine rifle doesn t feel as powerful as it did in previous versions but that expected from people who have way too much time on their hands the truth is counter strike global offensive is a worthy addition to the franchise and for the price tag it s been sold mere 15 dollars it s basically a steal gabe newell raises his hand every time someone buys global offensive and you should go ahead and do it
