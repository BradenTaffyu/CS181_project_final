the game itself is nothing unique but its done so well that it feels like it is i was having fun with the game right away but really when i hit chapter 2 i was freaking hooked something about the lore the story telling the relatively deep rpg elements the combat it just feels so damn fun to play im half way through the game at the time of writing this review but its just so much fun i had to add to the good vibes online for the game that being said does it drive anyone else crazy that the game doesn t have any terrain climbing mechanics i know thats typical for a souls like game but dude come on you are a monkey king and you cant even climb a rock or a tree maybe in the sequel lol
