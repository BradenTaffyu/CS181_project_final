when cheaters aren t a factor this game is the exemplary competitive fps movement and shooting mechanics are stable functional and above all responsive whilst providing a limitless skill ceiling that ensures that cs2 is an excellent outlet for improving your skills and progressing towards mastery the meta and mechanics remaining as stable as they do is a rare sight for the genre but is perhaps the most major contributor to why counter strike is such a rewarding outlet for moment to moment gameplay improvement and mastery when approached with a healthy mindset which can be difficult or impossible for some to maintain for me personally who is at an intermediate level of skill the shooting mechanics of cs2 manage to be an engaging satisfying and at times extremely difficult system and yet never feeling like an unfair or insurmountable obstacle the movement mechanics have surprising depth without intimidating or overly punishing new or intermediate players busy grappling with the shooting mechanics maps and especially utility is where the game makes available the full extent of potential skill growth through theory and knowledge where the other aspects of the game are largely tried to the mechanical ability of the player maps and utility largely reverses this and is the main factor which makes or breaks performances at higher levels of play counter strike can be a frustrating mix of reliance on teammates and reliance on yourself the game ensures that your performance has an impact and in order to win games against opponents of similar skill you must be able to lean on teamwork this means for many the game can be tilting through the failings of the self or your teammates but if you are able to develop an environment where you re able to lean on your team and develop your skills in conjunction with them then you will more often than not reap the rewards of satisfaction and hard earned achievement that counter strike has to offer
