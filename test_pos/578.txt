2021 after putting a decent amount of time into this game i have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play especially so with friends as far as playing games go i have always liked playing competitive fps as i find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked the skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don t mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so learn recoils for different weapons workshop maps are amazing for this learn nades pop flashes smoke and molly lineups etc up to preference but as i m still learning all the maps i stick to one or two maps when i play before switching to another once i m confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play youtube videos on how to play are good but i mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play as good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don t have the game knowledge or aim that they have i e as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you re ct probably isn t the greatest idea unless you have really good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you solid 10 10 game if you have good trust factor and time to sink into it
