2021 the first mixed review game that i really do enjoy 1 amazing optimization even though naraka has an up tempo combat style 2 cosmetics itself is very pleasant to the eyes 3 movement system is pretty enjoyable except of one point i wish dodge button shift and fast run button also shift would changed somehow frequently when you pressing it instead of fast run he just wasting energy by dodging death awaits you if skilled player chasing you p s don t be mad if you were killed by squikki that guy is a monster
