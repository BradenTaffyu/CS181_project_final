2022 dbd is one of those games that will make you so frustrated you actually get sick and decide to stop sitting in your hobbit hole and want to touch some grass for once in your life or you will decide you like the torture and freely allow yourself to get camped by an insidious bubba take your pick tbh i d still say dead by daylight is a great game depending on what you like of course is it really worth 15 probably not considering half of the survivours and killers are dlc just get when it goes on sale but honestly i still have a lot of fun and get a lot of laughs out of this game it should be known to anyone buying dbd that the devs are actually dogsh t and don t listen to their audience but apart from that all is wellit s really subjective on what your main interests are to determine if you would like the game if you like horror franchises such as films or horror games then i would recommend since i personally enjoy picking up dlcs that collab with things i like coming from a leon cheryl main it just makes it a lot cooler imobut yeah if after reading this you decide you actually want to give it a try just know you ve been warned and will spend the next 20 years of your life being hunted down not just by killers but your ever declining self esteem induced by being teabagged and tunneled by toxic killers and survivours
