this game is lit for a ftp play game i have to say this is the best ftp i have come across in 25 years of gaming i haven t felt the need to swipe money at this time yes there is a shop and a bp but that is to be expected with a ftp game you will def see the integration of a lot of games like the big one the division state of decay obviously survival craft i got some rdr2 vibes from some player houses i ve seen and the addition of player houses to the empty space of the game makes it feel so unique i guess that comes from archage all in all try it out if you don t like it then uninstall it s def worth checking out at least
