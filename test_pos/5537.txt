2018 this game is living proof that a rough start isn t concrete evidence of a game s future lifetime i would consider it a fantastic blend of battlefield s weighted realism and aesthetic with cs go s tactical gameplay really a great game to play with friends somewhat fun by yourself but really play with friends or try to make friends with the cool people you meet in matches playing by yourself will force you to go through some often unpleasant or uncomfortable situations trust me overall 8 5 10 great stuff buy it psa stay clear from the starter edition it s a cash grab deserves to be a free trial rather than anything else
