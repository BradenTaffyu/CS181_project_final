2022 warframe is a very popular game everyone knows about her but not everyone likes her in my opinion this is one of the best games of its genre and now i will try to explain to you why in this review we will analyze whether warframe is worth playing in 2021 pros of the gameoptimization yes i would like to say exactly this for all its beauty and the game looks really high quality it is absolutely not demanding on the hardware of your pc even if you have a laptop that overheats when you launch the browser the game will run stably on it so there definitely will not be required new video cards 16 gigabytes of ram and other things therefore if you have a weak computer then there is nothing to be afraid of content there is a lot of content here i won t even try to list everything for you for a clear example i ll say that i ve been playing warframe since 2013 when it was still in beta test then at one time i didn t think about this game for 3 4 years and went in just a few months ago so i was just taken aback by how much new things have been added here for you to understand it s been a few months now and i still have to google a lot of new things and i m still far from understanding everything it is also worth mentioning the frequency of these updates according to the statistics that i found major updates come out somewhere every 1 2 months and these are not just ordinary events with the chinese new year and other things these are full fledged updates with new characters weapons bosses quests locations and so on cooperativethe game is still geared towards team play together it will be much easier for you to farm complete difficult missions go to some raid events and so on you can do it solo but it s very difficult but solo players shouldn t despair well except for the lack of friends in short you can do it alone here it just won t be so fast well in the end no one bothers you to play with random people or join a clan like in the good old mmos for example i lost most of the time just by myself and have absolutely no regrets it helps to understand the game plot i m still surprised by this but the story in warframe is better than in many single player rpgs which is very unusual for games of this format there are a bunch of full fledged quests in several stages yes there are stupid quests where frankly it doesn t matter what is happening but there are also those that i went through as if i were watching a movie it reveals your race origin and so on sometimes of course they overdo it but in general it is interesting consfarmin the game you need to farm and you need to farm a lot plus there are such unpleasant moments as the time of manufacture for example if you are crafting a new character or weapon then you have to wait 72 or 24 hours which is just a very long time for donate of course you can speed up but it s very expensive if you are used to playing non stop then you will be uncomfortable with this waiting and here you can look at it from the other side for example now i don t have the opportunity to enter the game so often so for me it has turned from wild farming into a pleasant not so frequent practice i go in all the trunks and characters are ready i do not accelerate anything and absolutely do not suffer from it in short here you can either run into the farm play every day set goals for yourself pump like crazy and slowly play for your own pleasure absolutely not straining very high entry thresholdwarframe is one of those games where you can t jump right into the action and get tangible results quickly there are a lot of quests missions and conditions here due to which you cannot access something far away until you complete the already open quests but in fact it s not as scary as it sounds because as you progress through the game you gradually understand the game and now the most important thing get ready that for tangible results and not just a game for fun you will need to set yourself clear goals and search for information in huge quantities but there are also positive aspects the game has been around for 8 years and during this time it has acquired a huge knowledge base forums and guides therefore it will not be difficult to find something at all donate there is a donate you can buy a lot for it and it is sometimes imposed but not much the funny thing is that for a donation you can buy resources ready made characters or weapons that do not need to be crafted for several days well the most problematic thing to make a character you need to knock out its parts and drawing sometimes this is easy enough to do and sometimes you may not get what you need for weeks on end that s when you have to resort to donations but here too there are advantages firstly when you enter the game you can often get a discount of as much as 75 on donations it s a lot really secondly the game has the ability to trade you can trade almost everything with a few exceptions and when you play enough time you will have a lot of valuable blueprints and other things then you can easily sell it all in exchange for local currencies in the future you can provide be yourself with this without pouring money into the game at all but not immediately of course conclusions warframe is a beautiful interesting and optimized game with a huge amount of content and update frequency but with all this it has its own characteristics of farming and the amount of information because of which many people leave it without trying to figure it out so is it worth playing in 2022 personally i recommend at least trying it because in any case you can not get carried away but play for fun
