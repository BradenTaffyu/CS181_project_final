2020 early access review game not even finished and it blows my mind every pixel in this game can interact with other pixels causing predictable unpredictable or wonderous results even if it wasn t a spectacular rogue like all on it s own the magic and wand crafting system which synergizes with the perk system would make it deep and fun and ridiculously replayable when you add alchemy and the fully reactive and destructive environments the game just shines the game is full of secrets and mysteries and different enemies and environments there s just so much there competing monster factions runaway fires flooding random loot then dissembling your loot to make even cooler loot i can say all this and i ve barely scratched the surface bosses yeah bosses too game is da bomb
