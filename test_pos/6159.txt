2018 patience is a virtue with this game let me start off by saying this is an excellent game but if you are an impatient person or don t like a medium queue time you won t ever play as the killer especially not when events are around or a new killer comes out as we see legion there soon will that said i do really enjoy the game it s the only one i get semi competitive with because it is challenging at times but onto the pros and cons pros unique killers their idle animations attacks etc are tailored to them unique survivors same principle perks a good perk build can make or break your win there s plenty to choose from they re easy to get even the ones unique to killers you really don t have to spend a dime on this game or dlc s the iridescent shards you get for progressing your overall account level stack pretty fast if you hop queues like a madman and well get good at the game lol you can buy the killers or survivors and even their perks unique to them separately granted i m lazy so i still bought the ones i wanted regardless of this lmao i dig the whole level system i really do and the universal sharing of perks once you reach a certain character level it s very useful for customization of your build instead of making due with what you have the maps are pretty decent i don t really mind their layouts i love the fog and spook factor typically very friendly in regards to the community be you farming with the killer or killers like moi being generous and giving you the hatch escape not to mention your fellow survivors rarely do i ever find myself left for dead in the game people take great risks to aid strangers in their lobby it s actually super fun in all honest aesthetics yes i said aesthetics costumes recolors the stuff that the game didn t really need but was given anyways and i am beyond happy with how most of them look i see a lot of criticisms regarding the lack of chat or voice for survivors to communicate with one another but to be frank i feel it s not only aiding the immersion your sense of helplessness and fear but it also keeps it fair for the killer whom is soloing 5 people on a potentially massive map if you re all communicating like champs i for one can attest that it makes it that much more difficult for the killer to get one hit off let alone snag one of you it s balanced don t complain if you want to talk in game utilize discord play with friends but don t take away a critical element of the game to sate your want for an easy win you suffer for tunneling you focus on one person too long or chase just one person you re going to suffer progression wise because they will loop you around and around next thing you know 3 5 gens are done and you re just barely hooking some poor soul with sprint burst the sense of fear and helplessness derived from the sheer thought of being found in the middle of a generator repair or hiding painfully close to the killer is amazing i love it it s scary in the sense of if you re found you re in trouble if you re found 3 times it s more than likely over assuming you are not a palette looping master cons i hate hook campers i m looking at you wraith and pig two killers who can turn off their terror radius with their skills i don t even play survivors that often but when i do and i have to sit through this i can feel my brain deteriorating one cell at a time don t hook camp there is unfortunately no con to this as they still get the kill slightly less bloodpoints at worst completed gens at worst too but you know they still do it anyways granted it s not just those two but admittedly they are the best ones for it the maps as stated are not bad i do enjoy them but be that as it may they all kinda look the same maybe i just don t pay good enough attention but in my humble opinion 5 of them just look like reworks of each other with maybe a couple structures sprinkled in can i please get a pig costume everyone but the characters from actual series franchises has a costume or several and while i understand maybe it s a copyright thing i need a different look please gen rushing this actually tilts the out of me essentially this can consist of several people on one generator or one or several bringing in a brand new part which if you don t know the game makes it go by a lot faster either or end me hex ruin is a good counter for this but without it you re hit or miss for a team like that as a killer skillcheck glitches yeah we ve all had them we all hate them frame rate drops makes the game seriously hard for killers and survivors both hahahahaha good luck getting to rank 1 buddy scratch marks useless they glitch out too much hit the survivor follow the blood trail well assuming you can see it again perks fix this if you want to find them or hell just turn up your volume but still annoying i could do well without the survivor taunts when i don t taunt tunnel or camp them respect your killer while having your fun sucking the fun out of the game defeats the whole purpose of us being there to begin with this goes back to killers too don t face camp don t hook camp don t tunnel just one survivor or wait nearby for them to get unhooked and farm them spread your focus or lose your generators kid dedicated servers should be implemented no offense but i get kinda tired of potato connection from killers and admittedly even mine can be a bit unbearable to be around rubber banding across the map or running in place makes me wanna kill myself thnx overall it s a solid game with a few bugs and issues as most do i enjoy playing it with friends or solo the majority of the time if your complaints revolve around getting palette looped or stunnedmaybe you should uh get good no seriously palette looped play huntress throw axes nurse teleport through walls palettes etc jukes are easy to spot or counter juke if you play long enough flashlight stuns are easily avoided your only bane is dead hard and decisive strike these aren t legitimate complaints and imo even if they aremildly annoying maintain the fairness of the game for the survivors but yes good game 10 10 would recommend happy hunting may the best man win
