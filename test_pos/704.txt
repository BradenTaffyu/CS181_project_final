2016 this game has a crazy in depth story line with insanely insightful philosophy into the terrorism battle that is haunting the united states this game is all about terrorists vs counter terrorists and it makes you see both sides of the story and how sometimes the terrorists just need a little bit of love this game really unveils the whole bush did 9 11 conspiracy and proves how steel beams can be destroyed by bombs in fact anything can be destroyed by bombs that is why terrorists have an inert advantage when it comes to tactical warfare however the counter terrorists have many tools themselves such as powerful guns and the powers to defuse the bombs that the terrorists plant all in all i would have to say this game is pretty interesting in the whole terrorism fiasco that america is going through right now and is definitely insightful into many things concerning osama bin laden and whether the fact that obama is black or an alien no one really knows i personally think he is half black half martian
