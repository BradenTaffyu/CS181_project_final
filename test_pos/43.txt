review after 100 achievementsreally enjoyed my journey through this title combat feels really great with the stance swapping mechanics if you like boss fights this is the game for you with there being like 90 for you to conquer some more challenging than others but all are unique and memorable for you to tackle again on your next playthrough in ng everything in this game works well together the spirts spells vessels all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay the ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and i loved the chapter to chapter format of the story animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close most of all i loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring all of the achievements were fun to go after collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish this game deserves all the positive feedback it s receiving and i hope to see dlc a sequel in the future achievement count 81time to 100 70hrsdifficulty genre of game action rpg mythology combatfun rating 9 10checkout my yt video review or my steam curator page youtube video black myth wukong review after 100 views 7 003 my review of black myth wukong after obtaining all achievements timestamps 0 00 intro 1 11 overview 2 03 story setting 3 00 technical state 3 54 difficulty 5 14 progression system 6 55 gameplay
