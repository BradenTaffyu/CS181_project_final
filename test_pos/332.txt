after 800 hours playing it i didn t improve my skills in game however i learned new language skills now i can curse in russian and brazilian portuguese also my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased now i can bear the crying of my children for longer and i can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures such as dark eyes or garota de ipanema the girl from ipanema in conclusion counter strike transformed me into a better father and a better person in addition to making me more patient tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures better than any psychiatric therapy 10 10
