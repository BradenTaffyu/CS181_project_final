2020 product received for free i have close to 2 000 hours in the game over the last year and a half very addicting tons of content fun organic pvp it has a steep learning curve especially playing solo but with time things become easier i would suggest sailing with a friend if you re just starting out if you re solo please choose a sloop as your ship brigantines and galleons are for larger crews and are too much for a new solo player to handle you will be killed your ship will be sunk you will probably want to give up don t stick with it and learn the game everyone who plays started the exact same way it gets easier and if you can make it that far you ll really begin to see the reason so many people love this game highly recommended
