2023 this game is an absolute riot it s like watching a bunch of cute animals go through a midlife crisis while trying to win hilarious challenges it s physics based gameplay makes for some truly wobbly wonders the costumes are ridiculously good and it had me and my friends crying with laughter it s the perfect recipe for unforgettable parties pros good gameplay is a chaotic russian roulette but with more fur and less danger you never know what s going to happen next it has good gaming performance the costumes are cute fun with friendscons some maps are small enough to fall into the water while jumping it has a paid cosmetics shop to buy skins no offline modeoverall gaming experience 9 5 10game graphics 9 10solo gaming 0 10playing with friends in a public lobby 10 10recommended
