2020 early access review it s like terraria meets cortex command you will die lots of times in the first 25 of the game the the rest is usually hilariously easy after you find good wands and spells until you die to a stupid mistake it s relatively bug less for an early access game and there s an active modding community pace yourself or you ll get burnt out playing it non stop like me
