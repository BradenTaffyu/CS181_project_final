2022 it s fun to play offline mode with mods after finishing the main story it could have been better if the online vehicles and weapons were included so i wouldn t have to download a lot of mods but after a while it can get quite repetitive so why not hop on to online well online is better played with your friends than alone because of trolls griefers and quitters it s really hard to start the apartment heists or most heists in general with randoms or trolls who would quit halfway or waste your time in the prep phase with no repercussions since these heist are very vital for beginners considering how expensive some items in this game can be it really is a turn off for new players to continue playing in this kind of environment yes there are other options to earn money like the mc and ceo businesses but again you really have to play with friends or trust that no one in your public session is gonna gang up and grief you in those sell missions what s most annoying however are the locked items you can only get by leveling up in these dead game modes where your only chance of playing it is if you invite a friend i mean i could purchase some of them the arena war upgrades but it costs a lot of money just for 1 locked item whats worse is that it takes a lot of time to level up in these game modes and i don t have the time and patience to spam play that mode with my friend if the max payout per game is just a bar in that respective game mode arena war or tuners and don t get me started at the locked color modifications i mean you can buy an autoshop and modify them there but that s only reserved for non warstock vehicles i get the performance upgrades but why the heck do i need to level up in order to unlock a specific color its not like that color does anything other than being an aesthetic feature overall if you have friends to play this game with then by all means buy this game and play with them otherwise the climb to the top will be rough depressing and not worth the effort just play story mode with mods and have fun gta story mode 8 10gta online 5 10
