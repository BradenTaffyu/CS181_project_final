2016 over my time of playing black ops lll i am glad to say i recommend it the multiplayer is a blast the specialists are very cool a couple of my favorite are the reaper and purifier with bo3 doing 2xp about every other week it can be very easy to level up and catch up in rank with the other black ops 3 veterans with the first dlc coming out in just a few short weeks i can t express how much fun i will have on the new maps they re bringing in this dlc and the other dlc yet to come however with multiplayer being great i have few complaints about the campaign i feel like it has a few bugs that can be annoying things like you can t run alongside a wall or mission progress not saving all of the black ops stories never made as much sense as the modern warfare series did at least for me i still like the black ops stories but i feel like they don t fully explain things 100 overall the campaign had many cool things about it for anyone who has had worries about their system not working it ran fine on my lenovo y40 70 laptop specs are on my profile but the graphics in this game didn t look that great on low medium compared to previous cod games that is the only other complaint i have despite the few campaign issues i had i still highly recommend this it s a cod game if you re a true fan you ll love it
