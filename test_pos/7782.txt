2020 from my first 20 hours good price for what you will got starting with beautiful graphics wonderful buildings design adventure open world etc above all of these things a great gameplay note don t play this game solo it s more fun with friends i really enjoy playing the game and it has awesome fps optimization in my opinion there is one problem that you need to link your xbox account some people don t see this as problem but this problem really annoying me and it doesn t has any technical issues glitches cheaters etc if you want to play this game solo i don t recommend this game for you
