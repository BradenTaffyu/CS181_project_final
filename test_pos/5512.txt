2016 i came from csgo looking for something to fill the gap in the games that i play this game is similar to csgo in the sense that its bomb hostage and so on but this game is so much more than cs the mechanics are awesome i love the fact danger comes from every angle through walls ceilings floors it keeps you on your toes more skill is involved it takes a little while to learn but if you have game sense you ll do ok but the best part about it no 1000 skins no gambling its not just there to make money for a greedy company that cares only for the money it makes on skins rather than the game itself when this game is broken it gets fixed ubisoft don t release sound updates when major flaws exist in the game they fix them take blackbeard for example one of the new operators he has a shield it was op they fixed it however this game as a downside or maybe two the community is as it always is in competitive games toxic but you learn to live with it but what does really bug me the drm uplay its you have to exit the game and uplay to get friend requests to show on your profile and the lobbies often fail i m sure they re working on that or atleast i hope they are this game is a massive plus in my collection i didn t like it at first because i was so blinded by csgo but now i ve left csgo and started playing this i don t think i ll go back still applies 2020
