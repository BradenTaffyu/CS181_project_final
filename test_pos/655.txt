2016 note this is a temporary review i m still pretty new to the game so i ll write another one when i invest waste more hours on it my first gamei remember it really well because it was a game that summed up csgo almost perfectly dust 2 a micspammer named martin shkreli playing mlp at earrape volume 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from rush b i had no idea what i was doing no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned not surprisingly i went 1 and 13 or something like that gamemodescasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good kd ratio 60 of the time dust 2 30 mirage and 10 another map such as cache or cobblestone however these maps you most likely will play in competitive so you can sharpen your skills and map knowledge here pretty easily competitive can be amazing and it can be terrible it all depends on how good your team is and how good the opposing team is i strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don t get a team full of bogans russians idiots whatever if i solo queue my team will look something like this at it s worst some solo queue games can be cool meamerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensangry australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseanother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuessomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team or a 12vieother team uber smurfsomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiessomeone in a partysomeone else in the same party who says ez every time they win a roundanime enthusiast who always runs awp and scoutuh i haven t actually tried out any other gamemodes like arms race and deathmatch but from youtube they look pretty cool weapons and strategy silver style terrorists assuming they win each round round one tec 9 rush b cyka blyat idi nahui round two some smg round three aks round four and onwards someone buys an awp rest buy aks and armorcounter terrorists assuming they win each round round one five seven or armor plus decoy round two some smg round three p90 or m4 m4a1 s round four and onwards someone buys an awp rest buy m4 m4a1 s or p90 and armoreco round doesn t exist in low silver xdsave doesn t really happenstrategy b rush b blyat long a short a a split and that s about it you will get yelled at if you use the autosnipers p90 camp with an awp or accidentally teamkill rank up systemcs go has 2 rank systems one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with against having a separate rank system for competitive is a great idea as it encourages players to play more and work as a team however this can be abused and valve can t really do anything about it smurfinga smurf is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and creates buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level you can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles if they have few friends low hours in other games etc if you manage to kill a smurf rub it in their face you killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically sure its a dirty tactic but who really cares in this game vac system overwatchyeah not much of an expert on this one since i can t really detect subtle hackers etc however i think it s a little better than the tf2 vac system since players in the community can review evidence sent to them if they have overwatch and make the decision communityi ve heard many times that the cs go community is toxic and cancer because of the people that play the game it s true if you play this game you will meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die but thats what makes cs go stand out from other games it s much more than a game for millions of players many people basically spend all their time playing this game and i don t blame them personally i can t get bored of this game there is always something new you can do without the toxic community cs go probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently but that s just my opinion in game the community is very vocal with about half the players using a mic to yell call strats communicate good or bad stereotypical cs go players in australia nz sweaty nerds who play basically nonstopunmarried adult males who yell at their teammates yo this guy is literally a 20 year old male guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they re not cuties and hotties right here rich kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game here again australian bogans basically russians here anime profile pic who is really good at the gamepeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers jeez there a lot of themgrill gamerspeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them youtube presence mlg cs gothere are a ton of amazing cs go youtubers out there i recommend you check out warowl mojoonpc sparkles nick bunyun 3kliksphillip etc the tutorials can be pretty helpful and give you some game sense i know nothing about mlg cs go but it seems pretty big i basically chose a team at random envyus and supported them pashabiceps will always be my favorite player though since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit cs go skins and casesi ve already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins i want hey it s better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites also i wouldn t recommend unboxing cs go cases as you should just buy off the community market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit however if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife glove valve game developerseh i ve seen many reviews saying that cs go is dying valve pays no attention to the game anymore omg valve is ditching us for dota and this possibly could be true valve just wants money like any business would however i don t really any need for valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly unlike tf2 which has a 5 man development team note again that this is just my current opinion since i m still a newbie to the game friendly aspect to the game knife fights mid don t really count and the only friendly game i played was on cache with people spraying on the wall i left that one what a surprise cs go is a very competitive game so i wouldn t reccomend going friendly as you ll most likely get killed and kicked stick to hightower overall opinionit s an amazingly good game it could do with a little bit more attention from valve but has a huge player base constantly second most played on steam and will not die anytime soon the community is very diverse but don t take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay the game is played across the globe hence the name global offensive and will be for many years to come dayum that was a long review its just that cs go has so much in it to cover it s pretty good
