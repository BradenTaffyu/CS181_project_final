2021 very enjoyable both alone and with friends this game was well over worth the money i spent my friends and i have been grinding this game recently and having fun in survivor mode the killer mode is also nice because when they get off i can play a killer game because the queue for it is solo overall great game i think it is also pretty balanced positive 1 anti camp camping is incredibly hard and costs you the game thanks to perks you can run this is great because it deters killers from camping and killing one person at a time the perks are great but since the objective is to fix generators and open the exits and escape being camped is the same thing as looping the killer for that amount of time you are hooked this allows teammates to fix generators quickly and efficiently allowing the exits to open faster i love this part of the game where it denies campers and makes the game fun for everyone for these reasons campers are very rare since they lose a lot in rank and bloodpoints 2 satisfaction of clutch plays this one is from personal experience so it probably differs from person to person but my friends and i get really hype over clutch plays there are plays like cleansing a totem with noed one hit kill perk that can be cleansed aka destroyed to remove it from the killer and unhooking my friend who was getting face camped by a spirit and got the four man escape another would be blocking taking the hit for my friends injured to help them buy time to get to the exit gate simple plays like these are just so satisfying and hype that it keeps you playing over and over 3 the hatch i think that this is one of the more unique and thoughtful addition to the game when you are the last one alive a hatch will open allowing you to escape without opening the exit gates these give the last survivor a chance at escaping without taking their sweet time to open the exits 4 teachables at level 30 on a character you can have perks that can be taught to other characters who originally do not have that perk this allows you to play the character you want to play without having to worry about the perks they have 5 unique perks and characters everyone in the game is unique all survivors and killers have their own perks that you can have this makes the game more interesting and find the character that fits your play style the most for example for killer i like to play the huntress because she has a ranged attack where she throws hatchets i feel that she is someone that i enjoy playing and fits my play style for survivor i like to unhook people which is why i run the perks that help other survivors out like borrowed time anti camp perk we ll make it super fast heal after unhook and botany knowledge also heal fast 6 tutorial bloodpoints are needed to upgrade characters so behaviour interactive adding in 50 000 bloodpoints per tutorial clear was very kind and thoughtful of them for beginning players this helps them upgrade the character before entering a match with one level one perk 7 custom games the mode i have the most fun in are custom games they are the best addition to the game in my opinion i have so much fun with my friends in this game mode although we get no bloodpoints it does not matter because all the perks items add ons and offerings are unlocked you can lock them though in custom game settings it is also nice that you can choose the map that you want to play negative i would say that the bad things are toxic killers who camp or tunnel people out of the game to get an advantage other cons about this game is if the killer goes afk it will give u 0 points in 2 categories leading to 0 rank progress this issue can probably be fixed if survivors get a bonus for escaping in a certain time limit and load times are often really long however these issues do not ruin the game at all as they are not common and are not significantly frustrating another issue might also be how grindy it is bloodwebs have lots of items which will make you take a while to upgrade that character bloodpoints are therefore needed in high quantity aka play many many matches most of the bad parts in this game can be seen in the community not the game s fault people would camp or tunnel leading to a 2 min game and not having any fun especially with the killer cannibal there is a common cannibal basement camp where they go insidious to chainsaw one shot the person rescuing and cutting through borrowed time in conclusion some people in the community will be extremely toxic and u will need to expect some bad games where u get camped tunneled and spectate your friends for the rest of the match other cons camping bubba and midwichother aspects of the game i enjoy are the collaboration dead by daylight had with resident evil leon jill and the nemesis are great additions to the game and i hope to see more collaborations with different games the game anniversary items are also a nice addition to the game the sacrificial cakes anniversary offering that gives 105 more bloodpoints give a significant amount of bloodpoints game currency to upgrade characters this really helps with people who just got the game like me and my friends we are able to level up our characters really fast and progress in the game a lot easier the game is super fun and i totally recommend this to people who are looking for a game to play with friends competitively casually or even both i also think that the dlc is worth it although get it when it goes on sale or your friend has it on library share all the characters are really fun to play all characters are needed to complete all achievements
