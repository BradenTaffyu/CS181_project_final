this is honestly a great game with a large number of factions who each have diverse strategies and playstyles fitting a colossal map for different experiences and landscapes if you like strategy games warhammer fantasy or both this is a must buy while the dlc decisions ca has made are regrettable at best especially with shadows of change i believe most of them are worth buying also i think creative assembly has at least partially learned from its mistakes and after thrones of decay it looks like the game is in a steady recovery after the disaster that was soc ps the modding community is great and it s extremely devoted to the game even creating entirely new factions with various great features total war community
