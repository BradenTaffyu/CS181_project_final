2017 note i am actually going to review the game not the 3rd party extras for it since you putting your review under gta v not insertname mod so first of all i was extremely late to hop on board the band wagon for this game i was never allowed to play it before i moved out of my mom s a year ago so generally speaking my reviews are on the game as it stands now summary an open world crime sandbox game with a detailed well scripted although short story mode and full featured online mode with a full fledged online mode singleplayer follow the story of franklin an up and coming thug from the hood with strong ties michael an ex criminal who is trying to stay on the downlow with a faked death coverup by the government a slutty daughter a loser son and a b h wife and trevor unique phyco who litterally is not able to stop suprising you as they go to pull of their greatest heists online full featured open world with a light weight immersive story that is designed for multiplayer gaming where you custom make yout character pros detailed graphics a online mode that is constantly getting updates and new features highly advanced online character creator comercial and shows that are more honest and real than real life mock internet that is amazing tons of comunity created as well as first party missons that expand every day well developed protagonists that each one has many things that make them unique heists in online mode and singleplay that give you multiple outcomes and payouts depending on the crew and way you chose to do itcons ever since the introduction to shark card the payouts for online mode over all is terrible with the exceptions of heists which has been planned and developed before the game released online hacking is terrible because of ileagle mods which is why take 2 took drastic mesures in the first place it is good as long as you stick to playing with friends and don t join open freemodes generally does not integrate well with discord this is actually just a con of personal prefrence and as long as you don t care about game overlay is not a problem despite requirments for the game this game will run okay on most of your current everyday pcs modern and with optimization netural cops are extremly unrealistic it makes the game playable and beatable but really flipping the bird to a cop sitting on the side of the road causes same outcome as robbing a bank terrible flying controls when playing with keyboard mouse controller fixes this overall an amazing game and well reccomended
