2022 well i did it i finished a souls type game am i glad i did it yes i think so would i go back and do it again if i could no probably not not for a very very long time anyways seriously it s obviously a well made high quality game but man does it have some issues warning this review is more of a vent than anything i actually do think it s a decent game just not worthy of the hype it s garnered the combat is based almost entirely around timing and learning enemy attack patterns this isn t a problem in and of itself the right kind of player would love learning the precise time to press space against each kind of enemy however i am not that kind of player i like to play base builder type games and occasionally mix in some hack and slash rpg and shooter titles when i don t feel like thinking too hard if i m going to put in effort to master a game i like to do it by planning my moves ahead of time and experimenting with the tools i m given not by mastering each in the moment micro twitch movement if you re like me and flip flop between games like team fortress 2 and factorio i d recommend staying away from this one however i think that the timing based combat where one of the game s first huge problems rears its ugly head for a game so heavily based on timing and careful movement it has some awfully laggy inputs dodge roll one of the most important moves in the game has a delay on it about a half second between when you press the button and when your character even starts to move in the middle of this game s tightly timed fights that s huge it took me hours upon hours of wondering why dodging felt so bad before i realized what was going one after looking at some online guides i learned that this delay is apparently part of every souls title and that most players simply consider mastering it to be part of the challenge i suppose they re right but think about it anyways a significant portion of this game s challenge finds its source in intentionally poor laggy controls i m also not sure that the developers ever heard the phrase quality of life when designing this game there are all kinds of weird inconvenient things in this game that simply defy explanation why aren t the all important health and mana potions bound to a unique key why can we only use the special effect on our right hand when we can just briefly unequip it to use our left hand weapon why do equipped but unused weapons add to your carry weight if you re quick with the menus it s perfectly possible to keep your auxiliary weapons hidden in your inventory and then only equip them when needed so why make us deal with the carry weight issue is rapid clicking through menus supposed to be another combat skill we master and i think i would be amiss if i didn t point out the poor early gameplay progression of sorcery intelligence characters i picked the astrologer starting class since i felt like playing a spellslinger i booted into the game and started looking for better gear but nothing i tried everything i could think of i followed the path the game sent me down nothing i headed east to the higher level area no new spells no new staffs still nothing it was beyond the twenty hour mark that i finally got a new staff as a random drop from an enemy in the high level area and it was garbage literally worse than my starting weapon unless you happened to be using one or two ultra niche rock breaker spells and i only found them found those hours and hours later still it was only when a friend clued me in to their location that i was finally able to get my hands on some better spells although they were actually pretty close to the starting area there s nothing directing you there if you happen to miss the one particular set of ruins where the vendor is hiding you re screwed no new spells for ages even then it was probably past the fifty hour mark that i finally found a staff able to replace the starting staff which by then i had upgraded to be better than most non unique staffs and hours more before i hit the minimum level to use it let me emphasize something my friend told me where to get better spells i started this game determined not to look at the wikis i tend to be really bad about that using wikis to look up secrets however this was not the game with which i should have made that resolution because to paraphrase that same friend s words this is a game meant to be played with the wiki open on a second monitor now we reach the crux of the game s design flaws this entire game is made of secrets like seriously i m not sure that it s possible for a single player to complete a single side quest in this game without looking up instructions on the wiki at least not without spending hours upon hours upon hours scouring every last corner of the map for the next arbitrary npc location and talking with every character second and third times to make sure that some new dialog option hasn t appeared even characters who supposedly actively want your help will barely tell you what they want or even why you should help them e g one character upon first meeting will ask for your help in her war against the erdtree at this point in the game i still barely even knew what the erdtree was other than really tall and glowing there is no option to ask her why she wants a war against the erdtree or how even her cryptic assassinations quests help to combat the erdtree that character was nothing but a small contributor to what i consider to be the game s single biggest problem this game is so cryptic so utterly and incomprehensibly obtuse and obsessed with secrets that i don t think i could have told you what the plot was had i not read it on the wiki everything else i could have forgiven if the story had just y know made sense what s your character s motivation when you start the game you are greeted with a cutscene instructing you to become elden lord why who is my character why did they just wake up in this temple was the voice in the cutscene something my character experienced as far as i can tell this is the story of some psychopath who wakes up and immediately goes on a rampage killing half the remaining lucid people in this undead wasteland and subjugating the other half part of the fun of an open world game is supposed to be learning about the world meeting its people and seeing how they live in elden ring though the world seems to be nothing more than setpiece a pretty backdrop while you ride between dungeon to boss fight to dungeon there are people who like this stuff lore junkies who will spend hours making crazy theory videos on youtube however if after playing through a whole game i can t identify any motive other than go kill stuff and get stronger so you can sit on the chair next to the big tree i think there might be a problem the game s problem s can be summed up in one fight maliketh apparently you fight him to get something called destined death what is that it s never explained cryptic lore he moves incredibly fast and your attack windows are comically slim janky timings forget malenia this is the real hardest boss in the game however there s a secret item that exists specifically to fight him you d be lucky to find the item without going to the wiki and looking it up and even if you did find it you d be hard pressed to figure out how to use it wiki on other screen he kills you quick fights tend to last less than a minute however the nearest respawn point is a thirty second walk away there is no reason it couldn t have been right next to the boss door it didn t add any challenge all it did was make the boss take longer quality of life tldr if you just want to git good at fighting big bosses in a pretty landscape this game is for you otherwise maybe don t believe the hype
