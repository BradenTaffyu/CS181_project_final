2022 as someone who was put off battle royal games playing pubg i was dragged by a good friend kicking and screaming into apex grumpily i joined and played then put it down for a month or two till i was told to play again so i did funny thing is i found myself enjoying it more than i thought i would i started unlocking characters investing in the battlepass and god forbid even winning games now i play it most nights yes this is worth playing it s free you have nothing to lose other than time
