pitiable arisen hast thou come to read mine review dragon s dogma 2 is a great game that lives upto its predecessor in terms of combat and drastically improved visuals environment but not so much in the story department masterworks all alright but they did go wrong pros breathing vibrant and fully explorable open worldengaging combat and bossfights that are absolutely cinematic and a treat for eyesnew vocations that are really good and sometimes makes you the boss improved pawn system interaction which makes the game a bit more interesting though the dialogs can get repetitive at times which didn t bother me but can annoy others a masterwork in character customisation and one of the best that i ve seen till now the only game where i didnot feel walking from point a to point b boring or frustrating as there were threat and surprises lurking at every corner that made exploration really engaging cons performance can sometime tank in crowded places like cities which has reduced a lot after the recent patch and can improve more in further patches the exploration though fun isn t rewarding at all i have found equipments with way better stats from the shops than the caves dungeons apart from few new variety of enemies there s no new addition and it s always the same lot of goblins and saurians in the caves no enemy scaling in ng what really bothered me is the story it just ends abruptly and feels incomplete for the returning players like me who have high expectations from this i would just say that this is the same game more like dragon s dogma remake overall it s a great game and would always recommend this to those who look for adventures and love fighting huge mythical creatures climbing them and stabby stabby their face it s unique in its own way and one must definitely play this once in their life
