2015 bo3 is a game that needs your attention they are trying to show you how pc ports of cod aren t all bad and that they re trying to work on it treyarch really does try and make good ports of cod all leading up to bo3 in my book have been well made ports with bo3 treyarch is really stretching it they re trying to make a new staple in pc cods with additions such as 2 player split screen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year this alone shows how serious they are with pc ports along side this we have full dedicated servers an fov slider that goes up to 120 a reasonable options menu changable frame rates and much more they are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly i haven t met a single hacker in any gamemode as of writing this review bo3 didn t have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware i didn t have any major problems during the launch but after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up compaired to the launch as of writing this i have no farther complaints to say about bo3 performance wise now lets stop talking about the pc port and start talking about bo3 as a whole bo3 adds many new features to the cod formula such as specalists and a more fluid movement system a specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities these abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time this changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play the new movement system isn t something to go to much in detail in they mainly added wall running and sliding this makes the game more fast paced and fun to play tl drpros split screen specalists alot of features for a pc port new movement systemcons some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware this isn t as bad as before though overall8 5 10remember this review is based on the enjoyment i have had with the game this is all just my opinion
