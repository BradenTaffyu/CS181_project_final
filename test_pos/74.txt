i finished the game yesterday including a good portion of a ng playthrough to clean the remaining achievements and i have to say that with very few exceptions i ve been impressed more and more with it with every passing hour it s not without its share of flaws what game is really but as first effort from a newly formed studio this was nothing short of an outstanding achievement solid and mostly satisfying combat good level design with tons of branching paths and secrets to uncover staggering amount and variety of content with an absurd number of very distinctive boss fights excellent production value and cinematography across the board decent level of challenge from some of the toughest bosses i think erlang made me piss way more blood than anything in a fromsoft game so far etc etc personally the only glaring issues i can point and the things i d like to see improved in their future games are they should work on ways to eliminate or mask their invisible walls more seamlessly stumbling on one currently can be fairly jarring especially because it seems to be an almost unnecessary oversight given the overall technical prowess of the game the formula would benefit from having more advanced navigation and traversal options unlocked over time metroidvania style you know double jumping a grappling hook breaking special walls that sort of stuff while the combat is more good than bad at least good enough to count as a net positive for the game i would appreciate if they could make everything a bit tighter better sense of impact on receiving and landing hits clearer tells from enemy moves a bit less visual noise in the most frantic moments of action on a side note i have no idea why so many reviewers insist on stressing that this isn t really a souls like because i can t think of any other series that it resembles more closely the way the content is paced the checkpoint system the fact that everything except bosses respawns if you die or rest how healing and consumable work these are all almost a 1 1 match to most from software title and even the camera lock on system and combat are way closer to a sekiro than they are to say a god of war or devil may cry anyway to say i was pleased with the time i spent on the game would be an understatement it s currently an easy candidate for my personal goty 2024 with nothing in sight ready to challenge it but i have yet to play a remaining good half of shadow of the elder tree i ll be there for whatever this studio comes up with next well at least in the hope they ll capitalize on what they learned here if they don t decide to swap genre entirely
