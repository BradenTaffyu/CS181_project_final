2020 honestly this is one of those times where i really wish there was a middle thumb option for reviews i love this game but noita is definitely the kind of game that you ll either absolutely love or completely despise pros awesome physics between all the ways you can interact with the world mess with terrain and even perform genuine alchemy it s definitely the biggest selling point of the game it s just super cool the wand building there s a huge variety of spells at your disposal at any given time and there s quite a few spells you can unlock through various secret shenanigans having the ability to concoct any handheld death machine you want and subsequently die to improperly crafted ones gives the game such a fantastic extra layer of creativity and encourages the player to a experiment often and b learn from any deadly mistakes huge world the main progression is pretty linear but there is an absolutely absurd amount of secrets and hidden biomes for you to explore like holy crap i don t think i ve ever played a game with this sheer amount of secret side stuff before a couple biomes are really lackluster looking at you snow chasm and desert chasm but 95 of the time discovering any of these new out of the way areas and solving the obscure puzzles is just a joy that i haven t felt since first playing the original spelunky it s wonderful neat story it s told mostly through out of the way lore snippets and through the environment and it paints a cool picture of what you re doing why you re here how the world came to be etcetera while letting you fill in the blanks super moddable is there anything you don t like use mods and the game s more fun ta da subjective the difficulty oh boy noita is hard and everyone on the internet has already probably told you that for the most part i like the challenge but far too often have i succumbed to something completely out of my control you can learn from deaths from enemies or your own spell mishaps or from environmental shenanigans but sometimes the cards are stacked against you and you just get instakilled by an explosive buried in snow or dunked in to a sea of lava by a few pixels of teleportation liquid the problem is this is spelunky tier difficulty in a game where any run that s not a speedrun will almost always take several hours you die it s back to square one and you ll have to go back to all those secret areas all over again if you want to take advantage of their spoils this will really be the deciding factor in whether or not you like this game are you okay with the risk of losing hours of progress to little avail personally i think noita offers just enough for me to be cool with that but i wouldn t blame you for hating the hell out of it cons not a huge amount of unlockable content there s plenty of wonderful secret sights to behold sure but outside of the eleven orbs there are only a measly seven or so challenges that actually unlock permanent rewards two secret bosses three super secret puzzles and two huge challenge runs this probably sounds like a decent amount but remember each run takes many many hours you ll only unlock this stuff if you re going for all the super secret hidden side stuff if you re just doing a normal go straight down run there is precisely nothing to unlock there are actually plenty of achievements but they mostly don t unlock anything without many achievements that provide tangible rewards it often just feels completely pointless and frustrating to continue when you just suddenly die to some random x factor there s sort of a wand meta if you want a god run you re going to have two wands a rapid fire homing death laser that kills everything instantly and an infinite black hole wand you re basically shooting yourself in the foot if you re not trying to build for that and oftentimes the game will be the one shooting you in the foot by not giving you any good wands some weird perks some of them just feel like they should be features and some of them are one time bonuses that scale horrendously tinker with wands everywhere is so necessary that i feel like you should just start with it cough cough get the mod that lets you start with it and all of the wand upgrade perks are so profoundly dumb unless you get them while you already have the godliest wands some very questionable enemy design the game largely has some actually pretty cool enemies but there s just a fewww too many enemies that are massive run ending terrors got hit by a blinding wizard good luck fighting a bulky guy with a poison gun have fun getting your health drained for 30 years if you don t fight him from 30 miles away fighting a scrawny robot assassin haha oops he s actually the tankiest enemy in the game this extends to the two of the bosses the lava lake boss is probably the most nonsensically hard enemy in the game everything is fine except for that polymorph attack why almost guaranteed to end your run it just turns the fight in to oops do you not have any way to deflect projectiles or hide guess you die and the final boss is weird he s mostly super cool but if you re going for a high orb run the fight is going to take centuries have fun eating through several billion health that s not an exaggeration even the godliest of god runs will literally take over half an hour to kill it conclusion noita is an absolutely magical experience wrapped in a layer of barbed wire the game s still in active development so hopefully it gets even better play with your own selection of mods for the ideal experience because jeez there s a lot of wonky stuff if you can vibe with the brutally punishing difficulty i can t recommend this game enough however if you don t want to deal with that difficulty combined with the huge run length give it a pass or buy it when it s on sale edit 10 13 21 lol parts of this review haven t aged super well since i haven t touched noita once since before the full release because of how high commitment it is still a good game but sheesh just thinking about how much there is to do in the game with my completionist brain is so stressful
