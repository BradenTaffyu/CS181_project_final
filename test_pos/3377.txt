2015 i don t think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port the game runs perfectly at 60 fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature just put your music files or shortcuts both work in the user music folder found usually at c users your username documents rockstar games gta v user music after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in game audio options and you are ready my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you won t be able to play the game anymore
