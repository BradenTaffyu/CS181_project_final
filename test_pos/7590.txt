2023 glad they finally decided to make some kind of private servers i can now enjoy the game again instead of being spawn sunk now they need to make it so you can make a bigger private server with more ships kinda like closed crew servers on gtav i really don t care if it s a pirate game get over it yeah well that s gonna lose you a lot of players especially with griefers and spawn sinkers not being punished for it who wants to play a game where you spawn in and get sunk before you even set sail or immediately followed it s not our job to make sure we don t have those things happen it s on the devs who years ago made an april fools joke out of it they let the game get purely focused on pvp instead of it actually being a pirate game
