update 7 21 2024 126 hours in still having a great time i ve finished all the main story but taking my time before i jump full in to hard mode i spent 100 on day one i bought two characters blair and yujin and the rest went to cosmetics spent 10 a few days ago on the battle passso far i m less than 1 per hour and that s a fair value for my entertainment dollar played some once human for a bit but tfd keeps me coming back for 4 8 hours a day excited to play the game when it goes live july 2nd it s unfortunate they set the game to released instead of preload to confuse the people leaving negative reviews i get it not everyone follows the game as closely as some of us and all they know is steam told them it was available to play anyway i ve played both betas and the ftt and am really looking forward to leaving a more in depth review after launch day 1 had some issues out the gate there was some issues with premium currency not being delivered in a timely manner sometimes hours late but the game was pretty stable and playable some players mentioned issues with over utilization of cpu and gpu which can be a misleading stat but there seems to be some general configuration issues with intel based systems not defaulting to the gpu but i am on a full amd system so can t really comment i was in the low 70cs temp wise the whole time a big down is i m seeing some people having their data wiped after linking to their nexon accounts which is scary and their support site hasn t exactly been great yet still we ll give them a bit of the benefit of the doubt i m still loving playing the heck out of this game i basically played all day today since midnight for me this just hits the right notes that warframe failed to capture for me
