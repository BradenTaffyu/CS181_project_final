2020 my quick and honest reviewpro s the graphics are still good for how old this gam is it s a great game to play with friends it brings back memoriescon s community is dead multiplayer skins are not obtainable cause no one plays that mode anymorerating 6 5 10 the only reason i m giving this a good rating is cause it s always going to be a game with a place in my heart note good computer is required don t expect to find lobbies it s pretty rare that it ll happen but it s worth it if you wait for a steam sale and buy it with friends
