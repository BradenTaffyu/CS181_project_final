i played the steam demo and i gotta say this game scratches all my itches its got nifty base building mechanics and can build weapons to defend base when making special currency at your base its got some sweet crafting going on for armor and weapons and food and drink and weapon mods and various ways to upgrade stuff you can craft bombs and various explosives and use them to bust down walls to access hidden stuff you can craft various vehicles to drive like cars and motorbikes you can even fish in this game and get stuff and you can swim under water too and have to watch your air as it will run out under water which is great this game has so much freedom to go where you want you can fly too anytime you jump off a high place you can fly around until you land so its more like gliding but still very cool you get access to a talent tree as well as access to buffs that once you pick them you can t change them for the season so choose wisely and the gacha mechanic is pretty fun to get defensive deviants to use or offence ones as well as others that gather resources for you when you are not online which is pretty nice its totally open world go where you want when ever you want and see if you can survive higher level content even if you are low level and there are random events that will show up from time to time like a place that is covered in mist but you pick up a big chain gun and kill everything coming at you in waves out of the mist and get a chest at the end of the event there are various events that happen in many places and can get nice weapons and armor from crates often as well the gun play also feels very good in this game melee is fun as well i m all in on this game i give it a big triple thumbs up
