this game is very good but the grinding is insane and you got to be patient and i hate the fact that you have to wait 3 days just to build a new warframe it s also very confusing when you start playing for the first time like this game has been going on for many years yet they still didn t build a system that is helpful you also need a good clan to start with otherwise it s on your own and you will stay clueless for awhile once you start understanding i think it s worth playing and investing your time in
