2020 zombies this is the best game in the series for zombies and is pretty much the sole reason i bought it i still find myself now 5 years later coming back to this game for some classic cod zombies the game brings several great new maps and some cool new elements like weapon attachments loadouts levelling in zombies and an interesting deep story made up of many interweaving secrets and easter eggs the chronicles dlc is amazing and is probably my favourite part of the game it brings remasters of pretty much all of the great classic maps from world at war and black ops 1 as well as origins from black ops 2 this dlc is also now apparently part of the base game when purchasing the game steam workshop support also adds a great deal to the game as many people have made some incredible maps mods many of which are just as good fun as official maps weapons the campaign is also pretty good i enjoyed it the multiplayer is okay not really my cup of tea but i know it is somewhat populated still
