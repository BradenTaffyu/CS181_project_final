2018 there s been a recent update that has left lots of people unhappy because it nerfs the objectively stronger side of the game however i believe a review should be based off of more than just one update to that end my experience with the game has been great both as killer and survivor this is the game that i keep coming back to and nearly always enjoy the devs are very active and have done a lot to bring the game forward in the last few months
