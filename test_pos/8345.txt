2021 it s not so safe a place in the underground world of noita expect to die a lot with little to show for it but what you ve learnt in your time below which is where it gets hard to review i like noita really like it even but i find it hard to give it a solid thumbs up there s just something that sits wrong with the game for me and i m pretty sure i know what that might be progression or lack thereof noita really does leave you with nothing to show for a previous run you ll gain no new abilities no new spells no attribute points or perks it s very much an entire reset each time you die this would make for a fun mode perhaps but for me and many others it can leave you feeling like there could just be that bit more to things i won t be thumbing noita down it doesn t deserve that at all quite the opposite but i do want to stress that noita is not a game to feel you ll make clear progress in you won t it s not a game where you ll get to prepare for another trip down and purchase better robes armour to protect you and more powerful wands spells to fight with maybe it will have that mode one day but at time of review it isn t that game that said noita as it stands is still fun and interesting to take a trip into give it a go if you like the look of it there s a lot to discover
