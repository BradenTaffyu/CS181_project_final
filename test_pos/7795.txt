2021 what the devs have stated in their product description is pretty much on point undoubtedly the definitive pirate game on steam they mention unforgettable stories and it rings true to the point that each voyage players embark on is an adventure in and of itself some of the moments my friends and i talk about until this day that s how memorable it is worth knowing that many players have voiced their displeasure regarding pvp while i must admit to the frustrations over being sunk and treasures stolen it also simulates what sailing on treacherous seas feel like and that s what gives this game its identity to offset that players can invite others to a parley many situations where i could have lost all my loot if i hadn t used diplomacy goes to show that such pvp crises can be averted you ll familiarize yourselves with different types of ships and their parts respectively a galleon is the largest has more cannons but the hardest to manage sailing one to its full potential requires good captaining a full complement of capable crew members and constant communication i ve sailed with quite a number of serious players who use nautical terminology mixed with pirate lingo you ll get your chance to learn those through course of your experience sailing with different people the most memorable moment for me was a desperate escape from a galleon and the payback that came after they bombarded us without warning and immediately headed leewards in our direction we struggled to keep the sloop afloat while also trying to outsail them a kraken then appeared out of nowhere stopping the 4 player galleon dead in its tracks karma had hit them and without hesitation we unleashed a barrage of unrelenting retribution at an angle where their cannons could not hit us not only did we take all their treasure but we also killed that kraken whether it s using roguish tactics to double cross newfound allies or forming a fleet hellbent on revenge i m sure many have their own epic tales to tell this should be one of the best co op games of all time
