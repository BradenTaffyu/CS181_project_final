i have almost 70 hours in almost a week and by the emperor i am going to have so much more the game may not be for everyone but if getting in a skin of an armour clad super soldier facing an innumerable horde of alien monstrosities that will try to rip you apart sounds at least somewhat appealing i would recommend you to try it otherwise it is not the best game ever made i d even say it s rather simple almost old school style game with meaty visuals and a straightforward but captivating gameplay whether you find this enticing is up to you my friend
