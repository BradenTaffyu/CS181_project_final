this game is so punishing but it gaslights you into believing it s your fault it is so jam packed full of content that i wouldn t be surprised if there is still stuff to find i ve only just beaten the final boss and it only feels like the beginning the systems in the game are both intuitive and extremely complex alchemy in particular the wands spell combos you can make are super diverse and hella deadly both to the enemy and you i wouldn t recommend it to impatient people or people who get angry at games this game is difficult from the get go and takes a bit of time to figure out the mechanics and interactionsdefinitely worth the 20 00 usd
