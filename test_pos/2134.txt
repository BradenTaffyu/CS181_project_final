2023 updated after 290h positive notes high movement good combat mechanics also i really like the focused melee combat good maps no sbmm thanks god you can buy old items i really like the skills very high skill gap variety of modes super customizable characters but now let s start with the negative notes some items cost too much money dumb gacha mechanics sometimes the netcode is horrible zai need a look her ulti is too much you get stunned almost everytime and you can t do nothing ranked mode need a rework when you start getting almost every match yellow lobbies ranking up became a very very long grind and unnecessary i hope they remove this mechanic parry incosistent it not work properly everytime and this sucks spyware i don t know where this thing cameout but it s fun to see people caring about their privacy with a random game while they have installed every sort of social network in their phone and keep posting everything about their lifes if you really care about your privacy you will not even own a smartphone
