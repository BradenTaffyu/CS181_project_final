2022 this game it changes people some time ago i was a pirate we were all pirates absolute scallywags sailing the high seas plundering to our hearts content that was until our verbal punching bag of a friend decided that had enough of the pirate life and discovered a dark secret at first he spent his free time fishing harmless right that s what we thought at least every day he spent less time plundering and more time fishing more hours wasted catching fish it wasn t long before his life spiralled into a depressive cycle of staying up 18 hours a day just to catch virtual fish for three months it started with the need for gold but soon after it was not enough he needed all the commendations all it took was for him to earn the hunter of splashtails and he was hooked for good three months later he finally caught all the fish and got all the commendations what was he to do with his life now an emptiness ensued and he finally filled the hole with a girlfriend boyfriend i m not really sure who wears the pants in conclusion never ever fish in this game you will spiral into an uncontrollable addiction and waste weeks of your life so to those who have friends playing this game keep watch over them for me please don t let them suffer the same fate me dear old pal did and to you renai i hope it was worth it
