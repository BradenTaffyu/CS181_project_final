2023 the market for this kind of game just makes me sad to keep the illusion of prices being what they were in the 1990s developers produce a fragment of a game and rely on user feedback over proper testing expensive dlc over content at launch it s a risk management exercise and when the company acts the way ca have in face of criticism it doesn t give a reassuring feeling that the series has a future which is a shame as i have 350 hours of play in this game to date as despite the above pressures that spoil the customer experience for so many as a game it s very enjoyable the combat engine and ai run better than many other total war titles the campaigns and factions are varied in units and powers to give them a distinctive feel where balance is a bit messy such as perpetual waagh orc factions the clunky appearance of multiple free enemy army stacks to give an endgame challenge or the stupidly overpowered generals who can kill an entire army of 1000 enemies single handedly it still feels thematic the maps get quite samey after a while in the early game as the factions are always placed in the same territories but they do evolve differently each time so by mid game you end up playing something different each time this is very appealing not quite as appealing as brian blessed yelling gotrek quotes at you or watching all the colourful old world units still doing their thing in this unfortunate age of sigmar hope it ends soon
