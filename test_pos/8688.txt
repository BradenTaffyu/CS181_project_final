2018 early access review i really enjoy this software wise it is easy to use and has an unique interface huge selection of wallpapers to choose from not only can it move but create a dynamic audio spectrum visualisation have real time clock and play an actual song while idle this is a must have for anyone even my mother liked it suitable for any ages
