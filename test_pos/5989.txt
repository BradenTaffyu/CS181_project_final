2022 i hate this game this game is one with an extremely entitled toxic fan base who does not give a single care for the other players in the game the gameplay loop will get repetitive and solo queue is one of the most frustrating experiences you will ever have unless you re going to be surviving with friends prepare yourself to be railed time and time again by either your teammates or the opposition with that being said i have a handful of hours on pc and i have over 1k on console this game has its claws rooted deep in me and i can not take more than a month long break before i m right back to it if you are down for a potential beat down on your psyche until the moment you have enough experience to have a good time or you want to get up in a game with the homies this is an addicting game that although it is a slog will keep you coming back for more
