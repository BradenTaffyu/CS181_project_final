2016 i don t like much of ubisoft these days as a company they suck but this game is really good if you like the other games of the franchise your certainly going to like this one is really fun to play destructible ambient really well made on the bad side of things i have to add that it lacks some content what i mean by content is more skins that make sense for the weapons or even for the operators and more options to customize the operator more variations to them more options to customize the weapons and so on this part of the game is really lacking right now maybe this gets fixed in the future with patches and more operators to choose from hope this helps
