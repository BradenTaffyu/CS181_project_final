2022 it s a great game but no reason to rush into buying it just yet let s start with the negatives the major problem is that performance is not good even in high end systems it s going to take a few patches for ca to optimize it the ai is also acting weird and could use a bit of tweaking the campaign is fun the first time you play but it feels too much like a time attack at times i just wish there was more time to explore and expand in between the chaos gates opening the way it s structured means that you actually have an advantage if you don t expand too much and keep your faction leader near a major settlement in order to rush into chaos gates get demon souls rest at settlement to remove negative traits and rinse repeat the final battle whilst very challenging the first time you play it get s much easier after you realize what are the optimal unit types to bring and what strategy to follow there s a few glitches but nothing too gamebreaking in my experience most annoying thing i ve encountered was camera acting weird in battle maps with steep declining cliffs on to the positives graphically and visually stunning truly a work of art both in environments and units the battle maps have been improved sieges maps especially diplomacy and alliances are greatly improved trading settlements is back you can borrow allied armies and easily see what they re up to and you can even recruit allied units i really really hope they transfer these changes to the next historical total wars outstanding the factions are all great and they have interesting and unique gameplay mechanics both in campaign and battles everything feels distinct they finally did away with the web paged encyclopedia and it s back into being locally stored i haven t tried the multiplayer campaigns just yet but they finally increased player count it was about time for this change and can t wait to start some campaigns with friends when mortal empires map launches the game will really shine bright when the mortal empires map launches that unites all three total warhammer games into one beast of a game if you re on the fence maybe just wait until then game will be a masterpiece by then
