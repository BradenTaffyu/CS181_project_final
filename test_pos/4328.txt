warframe is a wonderful game that i didn t understand at first no i liked the campaign the plot and some of the character s abilities but at that time i still didn t understand how i could collect new warframes weapons and companions back then i just ran after meg with a bow and spear for a few months alone after such a long time i began to get bored with the game and i deleted it but it was only a break a year later when i saw the trailer for the new update i wanted to try playing again i ran after meg again but suddenly discovered for myself the inscriptions that always seemed to be there but i did not pay attention one of these inscriptions was about the single player game mode and then i decided to see what else there were and then i chose the online mode went on a mission and found that three players had joined me i usually went through the missions slowly for about 15 30 minutes but these players broke through to the finish line with great speed almost without noticing the enemies demolishing everything in their path this was a turning point because i was wondering how they do it so quickly where do they get so many powerful and different weapons from i started looking through the store on the ship the workbench and found that it was possible to get warframes and weapons without resorting to donating but buying blueprints for credits game currency and collecting materials in missions to collect the necessary when i made my first oberon warframe i immediately felt that there was much more interesting in the game than i thought i started collecting a lot of guns completing missions that i had previously considered incredibly difficult delved into the card upgrade system and even started participating in events it s a worthwhile game
