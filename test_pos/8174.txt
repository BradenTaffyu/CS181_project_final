2022 this game is so incredibly unique i don t know where to begin for a review first as many have said you will die often playing this game thats okay starting over and finding new things is part of the fun so is experimenting with wands and finding new ways to blow yourself up or finding new pastel colored liquids that kill you in various different ways this game has so many different and interesting ways to die if you survive long enough you might discover eating fungus has very strange and interesting effects on the world or that with enough perks and power ups you can basically become immortal you might even discover that killing the final boss isn t really the end but just the beginning
