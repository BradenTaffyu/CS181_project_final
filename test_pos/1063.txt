i wanted to wait to write a review until i was a good ways into this and at 185 hours i m only just getting into the endgame on my first playthrough and with a game of this size and scope i think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion i ve played all the souls and soulslikes and i went into elden ring with expectations based on those experiences but what i ve found is that it s not really a souls game it s dark souls 3 meets skyrim and necessarily more skyrim than souls but with less structure than either of them that s not necessarily a bad thing there s nothing wrong with mixing genres but i think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they re approaching it from you could be an rpg gamer looking for an edgier skyrim or a souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding so it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it s a game with very broad appeal it s a huge open world game and coming at it from the i want dark souls 4 direction i ve found progression to be slow and a little confusing i ve gotten bogged down at times exploring doing side stuff but then that s not really any different than what i did in witcher 3 a game i loved and other rpg s i ve also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot you re clearly expected to take your time poking around killing birds for arrow feathers checking out dungeons and so on it s this mixing of genres that s the essential concept of this game in terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics elden ring doesn t reinvent the wheel the combat is pretty similar to what souls players are used to going back to the first dark souls it has a plot very similar to dark souls 3 requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss what s different here is that in dark souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn t problematic because you re going to be channelled along in a linear manner but here you re just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own without any direction so if you re a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around exploring fighting a few bosses without being pressured to get to specific goals then elden ring works beautifully and particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the lands between and players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you re going to get there so one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes souls needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while works both ways and that s the beauty of it it s intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers and it s done a very good job with that particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven t played a souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable they clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they ve accomplished here it s not a perfect game there are problems the various pieces don t always mesh well but it s a unique experience full of interesting content and after a lot of thought i very highly recommend it
