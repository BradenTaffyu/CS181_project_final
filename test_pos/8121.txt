2019 early access review like other reviewers and news websites are saying this game has some great potential visual and physics but unfortunately it becomes insanely hard from the third level enemies deal lots of damage and use hard to evade attacks yet you can t get defense abilities much unless you are lucky enough to get some defensive perks or shield spells raising max hp is possible but sometimes you can t find these items at all so yeah i think this game definitely needs some difficulty tweaks anyways i can still recommend this game because the game has tons of fun magic spells and features the difficulty is the only one yet pretty big problem of the game 2019 10 11 update the devs have made the game slightly easier the player now starts with a water flask so you can put out fire or remove toxic stain from yourself and third and fourth area became somewhat easier and you can gain 10 max hp from health full replenish item and so on the game is now fairer and even more enjoyable so buy this game right now
