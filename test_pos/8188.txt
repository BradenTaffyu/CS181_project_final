game over or as i like to say you got noita d the game over screen in this game is a something that you ll very quickly get very used to seeing every enemy every spell every pixel is going to try to and will kill you a lot of people say this game is a masochists wet dream and whilst i agree to a certain degree i think a lot of the difficulty stems from the game simply being so uniquely unconventional it is common for rogue likes to not hold your hands sure but in noita the only thing the game puts in your hand is 2 wands a flask filled with water and a lil tutorial on how to kick things and armed with that knowledge it now expects you to travel to parallel worlds to become god or to recreate the sun and i wish i was making this up the depth this game has is insane which is great though i doubt anyone is going to be able to get a different ending or make the really really cool types of wands without using the wiki which might be annoying to some but speaking of wands the combat and wand crafting are insanely fun in the way that there really isnt a right wrong way to approach a boss or a hazard the game doesnt play by the rules and it demands you to do the same if you want to succeed you might sometimes make a wand which deals thousands of damage and think wow i can kill anything with this i completely broken the game with this wand im unstoppable and then a boss just says nuh uh and uses your own spells to blast you to death with them whilst also getting a 1 second shield which blocks all damage after each time you hit him but what if now you had a spell which homes onto yourself after you cast it and then have him copy that exact spell to try and shoot you with it i think you can see where im going with this and that s why i love this game it is an unfogiving brutal wizard simulator where each new discovery each new death teaches you a little more about the world and how to avoid all of its deadly hazards so what im saying is if you love rogue likes cool wizards and finnland lore and want to dive deep into an experience which will either leave you deeply traumatized or with the experience of being a god amonst wizards noita is a game for you though if you re someone who wants to find out everything by yourself or expect a coherent story i have to dissapoint you because this game if far too confusing to figure out most things by yourself so tutorials wikis are a must have but now all that s left to say is happy noiting
