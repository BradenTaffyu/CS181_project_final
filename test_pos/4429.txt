2019 because my time is valuable i only write reviews for games that deserve it if they make me 1 reconsider what a game genre is capable of and 2 change the standard at which i hold other games up to warframe does that it s an amazing free to play game with a lot of cool stuff to do for almost every gamer including people who like to shoot baddies people who like to hack and slash baddies and destructible things people who like to loot people who like to fly spacecraft people who like to progress endlessly and become more powerful than they were before people who like to theory craft and min max people who like to explore cool environments people who like to collect things people who like to try hard compete or chill out while they farm things people who like to play alone or with up to three other people in a squad people who like to decorate and customize their spacecraft and appearance endlessly people who like limited time events with exclusive rewards people who like to create art and be in a really mature pleasant to be around community people who like to watch developer streams and get drip fed hype for future updates on social media warframe the game is about amassing an arsenal of mechanical suits called warframes which serve as the playable character you control in the lore a warframe is your suit you wear as an operator warframes have three abilities and an ultimate ability some have two forms with six total abilities some have different resource types each warframe fundamentally changes how you play the game you embark on missions throughout the galaxy defeating enemies and bosses uncovering mysteries forging alliances making enemies and completing quests along the way you collect the resources and blueprints to make warframes weapons followers spacecraft and more hopefully if you don t have a friend to play with already you find one of those along the way too you can collect as much as you want or settle down with a couple warframes and weapons you think are fun you can rank these crafted things up simply by using them in missions to increase your mastery rank which is the player s persistent level which visualizes their accomplishment of owning and mastering the multitude of things in the game there are hundreds of weapons available to craft from many different sources such as rare drops quest rewards unlocked through research bought at a vendor bought from other players etc the nitty gritty part of the game is the mods it takes a while to understand how they work and impact your gear and deal with certain enemy types better but once you do it is no longer intimidating and strangely satisfying there are hundreds and hundreds of mods for your warframe weapons and followers you can upgrade your gear with these mods you can upgrade your mods to be more powerful you can upgrade your gear to allow you to put more of these mods you can upgrade while you upgrade so put an upgrade on your upgrade the business model is great too the developer has perfected the freemium model in this game you can get most of everything in the game except for certain cosmetics by playing the game earning credits and selling rare things to other players for platinum the real world currency of the game without spending a dime in a matter of time you can look and feel like a total bad butt standing next to a whale the most important part is the gameplay it s great by the way the gun play combat movement graphics and audio are top notch it runs great on most systems from the low to high end i wish i had started playing years ago but part of me is also lucky because over this time the developer has cleaned up the systems user interfaces and are constantly upgrading patching hot fixing and modifying the game to be more enjoyable by everyone the only question is why are you still reading this instead of playing this game good luck tenno
