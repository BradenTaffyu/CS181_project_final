2022 yes i recommend this but changes need to be made starting off with the positives 1 this game is gorgeous the atmosphere weapons animations and characters are on another level2 the gunplay is fantastic everything feels very real and the guns are fun to use3 the campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original mw2 4 the multiplayer when balanced is a lot of fun to playhowever there are a lot of issues with this game 1 breaking up lobbies to readjust for sbmm not only penalizes the player for playing well it also doesn t give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older cods 2 the aim assist on the controller is mind numbing the fact that i switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign 3 the main menu ui in this game has to be the worst i have ever seen 4 weapon balancing is desperately needed overall i recommend because the problems with the game can be solved and i see at least a couple of them being resolved in the next few patches but jfc it needs work
