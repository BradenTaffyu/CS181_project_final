2020 lower the price old games with community support maps mods and add ons will continue to do well for example left for dead or fallout 4 but when you are still charging 60 dollars basically for zombies as the multiplayer never that good to begin with anyway is hacked and finding a good game is rare so 60 dollars for the same zombies maps you used to play and 1 new map which will leave you confused if you stopped playing zombies awhile ago it is not worth 60 dollars that being said its a very good zombies game the community saved this game from being forgotten as new maps drop every week maps drop daily as well but normally need a while so its not glitchy this game is very good looking and you will be shocked when you enter most of the custom zombies maps how well done they are some look better than any map in the base game as well as some looking like it came with the base game if they drop the price of chronicles to 30 buy it with no regrets but please do not buy at 60 buying at 60 will only keep the game at that price for longer you could be the biggest cod zombies fan ever and i still don t think you should pay 60 buck for it as customs alone can be fun its way more fun with freinds and im not sure how many friends will wanna drop 60 on a game they ve played and that s almost 6 years old get this game to 30
