2022 fantastic game especially with friends pvp is great naval combat is like no other game out there it has some technical issues but overall feels great tons of pve things to do as well riddles puzzles treasure seeking and fun story missions that are all good fun a lot of people dislike the game for the fact that other players could attack you and sink you at any moment but that is all part of the experience you and your ship are never safe when sailing the seas or exploring the islands and this will give you a great thrill takes a while to learn the ropes and you will sink a lot even after hundreds of hours but that s all fine if you have a buddy to laugh about it at the end
