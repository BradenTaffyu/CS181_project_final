there are so many bad reviews of this game that really don t do this game justice i didn t look at any reviews for this game when it came out i bought it and downloaded it day one and haven t looked back most of the reviews are people complaining about micro transactions and performance issues other than some slight stuttering when i enter towns i don t have much issue compared to all recent titles that have disappointed me its hard to trust game developers these days i loved the first game and this one has met my expectations and then some blown them out of the water the improved and more satisfying combat the separation and improvement of classes rangers are bow only some people don t like it but i think it adds a little more variety the story can be taken at your own pace and is very satisfying i love the first game and have been doing multiple playthroughs over the years so i noticed changes in systems and gameplay you can make the story up as you go with random encounters on the road makes the game feel more alive i felt like i could really get into the role of my character and had spent hours on the character creator alone perfecting that master piece if you loved the first game you will love this one and if you are new to the game than i think that this will breathe new life into you with a fresh experience and you will be pleasantly surprised i have a pretty good pc its not a super computer but it gets the job done and i don t have much performance issues and only crashed once after 61 hours it crashed last night before i went to bed i am sorry if this review seems a little long winded and all over the place but i just had to get this review out there because you are seriously missing out if you don t give this game a shake most games are not perfect at the start of launch and that has pretty much set the standard for games today and i feel that dragons dogma 2 has broke that practice standard i m not saying that the game is perfect but i have seen a lot worse from other aaa gaming companies i have also needed to upgrade my pc for some previous titles before like elden ring so before you complain about performance maybe see if something is bottle necking you or adjust your settings any way i am done typing now want to go play this game some more buy it or don t you re only hurting yourself
