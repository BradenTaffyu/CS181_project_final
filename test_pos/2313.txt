2023 i hate apex legends i hate the other players ihate the cheaters i hate the matchmaking i hate the monetization i hate that it s a battle royal i hate the non btr modes i hate that they canceled titanfall apex buti love the gameplay i have played the titanfall franchise and the movement at least some gunplay and the weapons themselves are all taken from titanfall 2 the best shooter and i love it i also love the world reaspawn created and all the characters i have played a lot of hero shooters and these are the ones with the most personality and depth it s just a shame that reaspawn doesn t flesh out their stories and the world in general in recent seasons if reaspawn ever release a permanent pve mode this would become one of my favorite games until then i will endure this slog of a game for the little enjoyment i get out of it why do i still play this game idk i just hate myself i guess
