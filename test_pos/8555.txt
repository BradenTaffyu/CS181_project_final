2018 this software is well worth the price for the amount you get for the wallpapers displayed front of the screen it works flawlessly on my monitor and projects plentiful of effects whenever you like also gets updated all the time in seperate times so i strongly believe it is a fantastic app to have in your collection rarely every once in a while the wallpaper engine tends to act strangely when interweaving with the static wallpaper being used when it s out of sync with different apps being used otherwise it s not much of a annoyance i once thought
