i first played this on console when it released and quite enjoyed it having made the switch to pc gaming i wanted to replay it on steam to be ready for the dlc some people will tell you that elden ring is the easiest game from fromsoftware and well they re right to some extent this mainly lies in two things first the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you re feeling overwhelmed to come back later after getting more levels and gear that s something you couldn t really do in their previous entries also you have access to a variety of powerful tools weapons skills builds and summons that can make your journey much easier you want to do it the hardest way possible great skip those you re in for a challenge you could use some help use them or summon a friend to assist you i can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don t want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss but still want to experience the fromsoft touch there s no better way just play the way that gives you the most fun the game is exploration with a capital e no symbols to tell you where to go no quest diary it can be intimidating specially if you tend to have fomo the good part is that by closely looking at the map you will find clues to places of interest the play area is huge so is the content at times i felt like it was too much but at least you can t accuse fromsoft to deliver you an incomplete game some graphical assets are heavily reused that s true but it didn t really bother me that much speaking of graphics if you like dark fantasy atmospheres oh boy you re in for a treat that game is making fromsoft accessible to a wider array of players and it s perfectly fine with me
