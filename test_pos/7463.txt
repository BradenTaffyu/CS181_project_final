2020 update i wrote this over 4 years ago my old review is corny but my love of this game is still just as strong 1 000 hours later hope to see you on the seas someday original review sea of thieves is a satisfying adrenaline rush and surprisingly balanced if you enjoy pvp i m always on the lookout for new co op games on steam when sea of thieves popped up i mentioned it to a few friends and one of them was ecstatic he insisted that i get it asap so we could play together i m so glad i did within the first 10 hours this became one of my favorite co op games things started out a bit rocky my best friend and i simultaneously booted up the tutorial after i beached and un beached my ship i shambled through the rest of the tutorial on my end a little concerned about whether or not i d ever handle the multitasking that s required to be an effective pirate in this game soon after our good friend joined us and i went into full on panic mode there are other players right now all around us i knew there was a pvp element but i thought we were playing a private game and that we d be able to do that in the future it wasn t long until we were raided by another ship and it was definitely just for lulz the three of us were at an outpost with zero loot it wasn t long until it was over however and as we watched their ship sink and i came down from the stress i grinned that felt amazing i never envisioned getting so hyped about pvp i avoid most pvp anymore because of cheating and toxic communities but sea of thieves does it quite well and i ve had so far a very fair experience while i ve lost some battles i ve never felt that something was unreasonable i ve had people cuss me out for swiping their loot killing them etc if i could offer any advice to a new player it s learn to pay attention to your surroundings as much as possible this isn t a game where absolutely anyone can easily sneak up on you without you having ample time to do something about it and this isn t a game where people are required to leave you alone if you decide to stop at an outpost to sell your loot when you see a player ship in the distance then you re setting yourself up as a target if you truly feel a player is harassing you scuttle your ship and spawn somewhere else with almost 60 hours in this game now now well over 100 as of june 30 2020 though i really have a hard time wrapping my head around just how people feel like they can t get away from other players the only thing i can conclude is that they re just not paying enough attention to what s around them i ve played on all three ships now by myself and with a team of friends if you re solo the sloop is fast enough to outrun any ship against the wind it s actually very easy to completely avoid other players on it if that s your jam the brig and galleon add the thrill of teamwork and communication as with any pvp game sea of thieves is not without its toxic players this is honestly why i primarily play solo or with friends because i just don t personally enjoy teaming up with random people i ve met cool people and salty jerks and it s really nothing different from any other pvp experience in my opinion the rewards for completing anything in this game are purely cosmetic while i was lukewarm about that at first i appreciate how it levels out the playing field for players of any skill set even with micro transactions there s no pay to win mechanic while players are certainly a threat there are plenty of other things that can sink your ship from the kraken to a rainstorm from ghost ships to a poorly placed gunpowder barrel it s difficult to deal with some of the pve threats when you re solo but it s very possible with practice and patience sea of thieves is also graphically and musically beautiful it easily has the nicest looking water i ve ever seen in a video game i m normally a little thalassophobic when it comes to large bodies of water in video games but it s just so darn gorgeous that i m always ready to jump in and swim around further i knew i recognized the composition style from somewhere and it s none other than robin beanland that s just another plus for me as a gaming music nerd there are a variety of bugs that seemed to have been fixed at least for me in the most recent update ship compass freezing wind not showing up not being able to interact with things and having to die or find a mermaid to reset rare seems really set on making this a polished experience however and it s given me even more incentive to stick around and keep playing
