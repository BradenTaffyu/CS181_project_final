2021 noita is a lot of fun it s just not a great roguelike noita is part 2d platformer part twin stick shooter with roguelike elements inside a incredibly destructible environment but the one element that really stands out is the wand crafting each time you explore the world you ll uncover randomised wands that hold a variety of spells stats if you manage to survive each level you ll be able to swap the various spells between these wands the way these spells can interact can make for some insanely overpowered results usually ending in giant explosions of destruction combine a burning spark shot that on hit casts multiple lighting infused bombs or shoot out multiple projectiles that ignite the world on fire also cast black holes when they hit to rip the burning terrain apart the potential for building wands is huge it s the biggest draw for noita unfortunately i found the rest of the game to be a bit lacking in a normal run you make your way down through the levels to a final boss who by the time you get to can be a pushover one or two shots due to the overpowered wand you have made the world itself although somewhat proceedurally generated has the exact same biomes that extend out in more directions than just straight down there s some secrets to find the downside is it s a bore to traverse this extended world in multiple playthroughs it s tedious to keep travelling to pick up the same secret bonuses over over each run there s also no overall progression something that s desperately needed at this point to alleviate these downsides noita is still worth playing you ll have fun creating crazy wands destroying the environment however it just doesn t stand up in the other aspects because of this doesn t come close to the replayability of other more well constructed roguelikes
