2021 when i first heard of noita i kinda dismissed it as a terraria clone with some cool physics stuff what i got when i looked under the cover was one of the deepest and endlessly replayable gaming experiences i ve ever had of course the physics stuff is a big part of the noita experience but i guess i d describe noita more like an alchemical rpg with permadeath i m hesistant to call it a roguelike because i feel like that term is a bit reductive and doesn t really sum up the gameplay loop of noita in a satisfying way to me forgive the comparison but noita has a darksouls esque crypticness to it you re thrown into a vast 2d open world with semi procedural environments loaded with secrets the obvious path is to go into the dungeon and keep going deeper until you reach the final boss but there are so many secret objectives secret locations secret bosses and secret endings to be found if you go off the beaten path which the game encourages you to do one of the biggest features that isn t publcized enough is this game has an incredibly deep wand and spell crafting system every wand you pick up has different stats that determine how spells are cast and how fast and regularly they are cast in safe zones you have the ability to tinker with wands by removing and adding spells from the wand s slots which all interact in a way that s almost reminiscent of coding more than crafting this comes from the minds of baba is you and as you might expect you can create absolutely insane combinations of spells that can come out in an infinite number of ways by the endgame you ll have a rapidfire wand that conjures rapidfire lightning bolts that jump from enemy to enemy and freeze them or a wand that summons goats that launch nukes that home on enemies it s really insane what s possible in this game it makes every playthrough exciting and unique the game encourages you to find ways to break it something that is really emblematic of noita s design is the fact that the game s saferooms you find the in dungeon typically close off when you leave them but if you have certain spells you can dig through the walls of the saferoom and make a tunnel to allow you to come back whenever you want this isn t an exploit because when you do the game punishes you by summoning a powerful messenger of the gods to stop your exploits it lets players control the way they want to play while presenting interesting risks to the potential rewards of breaking the typical flow of the game this is all just scratching the surface though this game is deceptively massive and i feel like i m going to be playing it for a long time and that s before even getting into the huge number of mods what a fantastic game unlike anything i ve ever really played before also btw there s a pseudo multiplayer mod that s really fun to play with friends check out noita together
