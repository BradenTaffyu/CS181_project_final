2021 you open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that s due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu you pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game you pick octane cause you like running around fast not cause he s on drugs your teammates pick caustic and wraith it s another ttv wraith the champion squad is a pred and 2 master players the game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way you get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn t exist and you couldn t hear them coming ttv wraith goes down you clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced meanwhile your caustic is setting up traps outside the zone you collect your wraith s banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0 2s left on the timer you re in awe that this one stayed that long someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you they then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them the predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process your caustic dies to zone you re back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party they complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2 you queue for another game you get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger code leaf you wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more cause you know it s worth going through it all again just to take another glance at loba s thick ass
