2022 elden ring is an absolute masterpiece i haven t beat any souls games previously but i did a lot of grinding on dark souls 3 as well as dark souls 2 and 1 i really enjoyed it and had a blast creating my character and grinding souls so i figured i would try elden ring it was definitely worth every penny to start off the graphics are absolutely insane i am playing on my xbox series s and having no issues at all it has a steady frame rate and the loading times are minimal not to mention it s a treat to look at the foliage sky sun water everything looks surreal and hyper realistic not to mention enemies look very detailed and bosses are extremely intricate in terms of bosses i finally beat the first one margit after about 10 15 hours of grinding runes this game wants you to either explore or find a good farming spot and rewards your effort for either option i really enjoyed looking for a good farming spot and then collecting runes and leveling up my stats when it comes to building a character you have a lot of control over your build it s very extensive and makes it so you can control your play style i started off as a samurai and leveled up my katana and that s been my main weapon for most of my play time however to my delight i also found some wolverine claws which are awesome to use some weapons also have specific skills that come with them which makes it very cool to find new ones and experience on top of that there s also some great looking armor sets in this game that will truly make you feel badass this game has been a blast and i haven t even really gotten anywhere in the story yet although to be honest i don t pay much attention to the stories in these games it s all about the challenges and experience that i enjoy i know this review is not incredibly detailed or really structured however if you are interested in a game that will reward you for your time as well as teach you it s inner workings this is definitely for you if you enjoy exploring depth worlds and fighting monsters this is definitely for you
