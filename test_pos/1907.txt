playtime 300 hoursscore 6 5 10once human offers a deeply atmospheric survival experience set in a haunting post apocalyptic world however despite its strong start the game struggles to maintain engagement in the long run here s what stands out and where it falters what worksimmersive world building the game s dark dystopian world filled with mutated creatures and creepy locations makes exploration engaging and tense its atmosphere is one of once human s strongest points combat flexibility build variety players can customize their combat experience through a variety of weapon mods and gear whether you prefer long range sniping explosives or close combat builds the game offers enough flexibility to experiment with playstyles prime wars raids late game activities like prime wars and raids allow you to test your builds in challenging scenarios while these add some replayability they quickly devolve into resource management rather than offering new challenges where it falls shortshallow endgame content much of the endgame revolves around farming mods with perfect stats which can be repetitive and unrewarding players are left grinding the same content hoping for the right drop which feels more tedious than engaging time gated progression the game enforces a weekly cap on important resources like starchrom artificially stretching out gameplay and turning what could be a smooth experience into a slow grind players feel that the developers designed the game to stretch out progression by forcing players to wait for new seasons or updates instead of offering fresh engaging content once human relies on time gated resources like starchrom and controller currency creating unnecessary barriers grindy resource farming beyond mod farming grinding for resources like ammo and repair materials is necessary to continue participating in prime wars and other high end activities while some may enjoy the grind it quickly becomes a chore especially as content plateaus with little variationlimited exploration after max level once you unlock most areas the map feels relatively small there s little to explore after completing the main regions leaving players with less motivation to venture back into the world seasonal wipes every six weeks the seasonal wipe system resets key progress forcing players to replay the main and side missions although some items and upgrades carry over having to redo missions after each wipe becomes tedious and discouraging for long term players lack of optimization building system issues since once human is still relatively new it suffers from poor optimization the game is buggy and experiences frequent lag even when players lower their graphics settings additionally the building system feels unrefined placing certain structures and items can be a hit or miss as the placement mechanics feel unhinged and often unintuitive it definitely needs improvement to make base building feel more satisfying and less frustrating during the gameplay the bottom lineonce human has potential with its strong atmosphere and flexible combat systems but its lack of meaningful endgame content grind heavy progression and frustrating seasonal wipes make it difficult to stay invested combined with poor optimization and performance issues the overall experience feels incomplete it s not perfect as most things aren t but it is well enough to play for how it is surely there are other issues that i may be unaware of or know of but forgot to mention but these are the highlights of what i ve experienced over the course of 300 hours if you enjoy survival mmos give it a try but be prepared for some frustrations as you reach the later stages of the game
