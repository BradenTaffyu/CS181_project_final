2020 awesome gameplay experience hope they get rid of all cheaters there are many you meet many types of cheaters wall hackers aim hackers forsaken type cheaters etc they make me wanna hate the game but there are many genuine players too some are really helpful if u are new like me u will be trolled kicked out hated because of being noob from matchmaking servers people will fire you u heavenly words slangs when u miss to kill but as i said many are not like that best way is to mute those godly creatures and play and improve people tend to forget that they were also noob when they started playing hope this review helps thank you
