2019 pros movement is something else it may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls this is possibly the best platforming i ve seen in a third person shooter high octane to the point where sometimes i feel i m getting motion sickness you can farm prime parts to sell for platinum the premium currency which means that with some patience you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real world money most items have a ton of customization options aside from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything warframes recolorable weapons recolorable your own spaceship yes recolor away pets sadly are a biiiiit harder to recolor i think very very well optimized i play this game butter smooth on my ages old pc and wouldn t be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop cons very very grindy if you just craft a warframe it literally takes days 72 hours before your frame is finished being made you can actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game production value shoots up as you progress showing that later content earth through uranus feels very samey where you re just progressing from node to node junction to junction and it will test your patience uranus neptune and above though you begin to actually get proper quests with cinematics and everything however the game takes too long getting here i feel that s why they plopped cetus and fortuna where they are now to give new players a break from the node to node slog and overall content drought terrible customer support there is very little info on how to progress past uranus so heed my words when you hear odd sounds in uranus sealab words get your scanner out and scan the noodle monsters where did space mom go she said she was only going out for cigarettes it s been years
