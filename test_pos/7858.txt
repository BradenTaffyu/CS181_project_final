in sea of thieves i experienced some unique moments setting aside the pirate life and the fact that the game looks and runs superbly i can t help but remember the time when i was playing with friends and instead of using the bait for fishing i ate it i ate it and a few seconds later i vomited on a friend right in his mouth then he vomited on me you have to appreciate the attention to detail and believe me since then i avoid doing that in real life as captain jack sparrow would say yo ho ho and a bottle of rum hey don t vomit on me and that s just one of the moments it s a must play with friends we ve had hundreds of hours of fun and i have just as many recorded on my hard drive mainly because i m too lazy to make montages from the recordings anyhow i 100 recommend it the game is hands down the best multiplayer pirate game since there s still no better single player one than assassin s creed black flag
