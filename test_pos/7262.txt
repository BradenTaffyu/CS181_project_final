it is my first detailed review but i will be honest and i will make it as detailed as possible dragon s dogma 2 is a fun experience a game worth buying but i want to mention each section that follows with a few details combat my gods the combat can be the funniest thing you can experience you can stomp on giants and dragons and still get cucked from wolves any playstyle you choose is viable and it comes with many different opportunities while the enemies are not rich in variety you will notice that they will also change to be stronger and different in appearance the more you progress the story a small example is the typical early goblin that you will encounter later they become bigger armored and tend to be in bigger packs the elite enemies also give you a satisfying battle each time especially when they can come out of nowhere like the griffin when you are chilling in a wagon a solid 8 5 10 story at the first steps of your journey the story is rather vague and plain you soon learn who you truly are and what is your purpose the majority of questlines are rather simple too telling you do kill that or bring me that now without spoiling much you have to prove through these quests who you are in this world the problem is the rewarding is not that satisfying story perspective you would expect to be noticed more for specific major npcs but that doesn t really happen except from one or two then you reach the end of the story leading to the final boss fight i beat it and proceeded to continue towards the conclusion then the unexpected happened there is a true ending in this game that you can follow which in my honest opinion it was amazing the story line continues even after you fought the boss and the game progresses further and not by a simple quest but something grant that effects the whole world and all the important npcs too including your main pawn in conclusion the true ending is a must for a wholesome fullfilling story experience i absolutely recommend it for anyone that found the story to be average until that point 5 10 without true ending 9 10 with true ending performance i did not encounter a problem maybe an fps drop around 30 when i entered the main city once i don t have a nasa computer but my specs aren t the oldest either i have seen many topics regarding this issue but unfortunately i am not in position to say anything because the game is running smoothly for me character creation second only to black desert it is amazing simple as that wait to see the other main pawns from other players too if you haven t seen anything already from yt or other media micro transactions seriously it pains me to see this game being shadowed from that topic the first step i did before bying this game was to check about this mtx issue that seemed to plague this game every choice you have in your disposal to buy can be farmed in matter of hours twicefold even the only exception is the soundtrack dlc so the main problem here is not the choices of dlc that you can farm or receive in game its the controversy of actually putting mtx in a single player game i don t support that idea by all means but i wanted to be fair with myself so i put things down and checked 1 do these mtx dlc choices hinder my progress if i don t have them the answer is no 2 are they needed for a specific part of the story or to unlock more content for it the answer is no if i haven t seen all these controversial topics for this matter online i will be completely honest i wouldn t even know they actually exist in the game there were no pop ups or anything specifically even to guide you to buy them i emphasize on that because unfortunately there is a big psychological manipulation that exists behind this behaviour hence its controversy too so for a game not guiding you to buy anything that is completely optional and unnecessary except the soundtrack which is just not my thing it comes clear and fair tldr solid game worth your time and money ignore the mtx controversy play the game with its true ending
