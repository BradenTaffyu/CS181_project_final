2023 best of the trilogy only negative sides are that the older races don t have really any play value as they really don t have any of the features for example dwarfs could have the caravan system or something like that and the second negative is that the new races like all the chaos demons are op af they just start stomping on turn 10 and if you are on the way well good luck but i love the game in every other aspect
