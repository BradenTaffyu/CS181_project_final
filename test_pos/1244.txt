2022 fortunately the game is running pretty good for me i have the exact minimum specs and the game runs at a nearly constant 60fps on low and some medium i think amd performance is better than nvidia but don t quote me on that this game is so amazing once the fps issues get fixed i am confident this will be the best souls game ever made absolutely incredible so far
