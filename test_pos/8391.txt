2023 my favorite thing about lies of p is it s potential for player expression you re allowed to beat the game mostly however you want you can perfect guard every encounter dodge every enemy attack or do a mixture of both whenever you see fit typically there are better approaches to every fight but the game will meet you on your own terms and give you the freedom to choose how you tackle it you re allowed to build any weapon you want by combining different blades with different handles or use any special boss weapon from the various fights throughout the game if you want to stick a giant wrench to the end of a dagger handle you can if you want to put a greatsword blade on a rapier hilt you can this simple tweak to a standard weapon selection system adds so much variety between every playthrough and every person s experience with the game you ll encounter several boss fights over your 30 hour playthrough of the game most of them are good if not great while a few of them not so much bosses are incredibly aggressive but readable and reactable say for a few fury attacks which require memorization in timing as opposed to testing of reactions i was actually surprised to see how many fantastic fights this game offers there are several bosses i would understand seeing at the top of someone s favorite lies of p boss list the game is also a lot harder than i was expecting with several bosses taking over an hour sometimes up to 3 to beat another thing to note is the game s story i won t be giving any summary here but i m surprised at how invested i actually was in the characters and story surrounding them it s a refreshing change to see a game in this genre with such a defined and explicit narrative there were more than a few characters i grew to genuinely really like and feel for complementing the story is the great soundtrack through the game this includes boss themes as well as the vinyls you can obtain and play in the hotel hub area the songs used give the desolate and depressing world so much more life and context the world of lies of p is beautiful and feels lived in and overrun by the puppets and corrupted roaming about it could have done better with more impurities in the objects around the levels and architecture but that s more of a nitpick than anything the game isn t perfect however it falters towards the end and stumbles in it s final act after laxasia you feel like you re closing in on the finale but then it sort of just continues for a bit too long before the actual end of the game the reason i take issue with this area is because up until this point the game has done an incredible job at making every location feel fresh with new or remixed enemy types level design and area visuals but this final stretch feels like a retread of the last few areas without enough of a difference to warrant being included you could argue that this serves as a sort of down time before the final fight but the enemies here are just as aggressive as usual and you ll probably end up running past all of them at this point all in all lies of p is one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory and surpassed the expectations i had for it by a long shot it s one of the best soulslike games i ve had the privilege of playing and i m incredibly excited to see the upcoming dlc and whatever next game comes from this series
