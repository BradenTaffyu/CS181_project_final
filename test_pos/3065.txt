2018 single playeri ve played gta iv for the 3rd time 6 months ago and now i ve finally played its successor 3 years after its release on pc and 5 after consoles i ve seen several people saying they prefer iv and i suppose it s mostly because of the narrative besides some inconsistencies niko continues to be the best protagonist in the series and his story is way more dramatic than franklin s michael s and trevor s the same goes for cj in the original san andreas title still v is a bigger game took me over 150 hours to get to the end against 55 to finish iv more 37 hours for its 2 expansions and has a way greater mission variety one thing that bugged me is how easier this new installment is escaping the police is a cakewalk health quickly regenerates so i ve never bought armor something that was indispensable in iv and not only your car doesn t explode anymore when it rolls over but it magically turns back on its wheels like it was a turtle with supernatural powers another big letdown is the original music not as memorable as iv s having 3 main characters may have weakened the drama but i enjoyed changing from one to another quickly going to different parts of the map and catching them going about their routines franklin could have been way more interesting never rising above the clich of being the smarter guy from the hood the one who knows that being in a gang in his 30s is pathetic but still failing to move on to an honest living although he tries at the beginning michael is interesting especially because he s so despicable and has a very dysfunctional family but also doesn t stray too far from being a parody of tony soprano and trevor the mentally ill canadian is the star and could have been the sole protagonist because he s the one who manages to be more than a stereotype with an interesting and dramatic backstory his introductory sequence involving an old acquaintance from iv is mind blowing literally and what he does to an apartment he inhabits for a while in vespucci beach is a riot again the sense of humor is one of the greatest things about a rockstar game particularly on the internet you better check your phone after every mission thank god we don t have to drive to a cyber caf anymore to follow the news bleeter and life invader besides the websites they re hilarious very well written and you ll be missing out big time if you ignore them tv content is also amazing as the talk radio stations the best program is chakra attack with the great comic j b smoove gta still is a great satire of the usa the tennis minigame disappointed me because it is very simple but the golf one is great in almost every session i had to play it there are a lot of other activities including triathlon the last of them is so big that it takes over 30 minutes hunting is nice but it s hard to go very far those damn mountain lions and although i liked chop i didn t care about walking him out especially after franklin moves from his aunt s house there are several references to iv and san andreas one cool easter egg is og loc s gold record on franklin s wall so i strongly recommend that you play at least these two before enjoying this one onlinei m about rank 18 now so i m still far from having experienced all that the online portion of gta v has to offer but differently than red dead redemption s online mode this one is very co op oriented so you ll need good friends to really enjoy yourself i haven t noticed any hackers or cheaters yet and that was a pleasant surprise because i read so many horror stories about that what i usually meet are players that are reckless or not very good during missions others that kick you out of jobs because you re still low leveled a few that think it s funny to kill you while you re going about your business and some cool players too the occasional bugs and crashes the constant phone calls of npcs that ask me to buy expensive stuff whenever i enter a session and the fact that the weapons i collect ingame disappear after a while i guess you only keep what you buy are very bothersome but the online game can be great if played with a group of friends that take the fun seriously although i don t think i ll play this for the same amount of time i spent in single player i ll probably return only when there are good discounts on property and money prizes for logging in if you wish to play it here s my advice forget about grinding just have fun and the money to buy stuff will come naturally edit january 2019 i m now at rank 28 made some money and bought some property a nightclub and a motorcycle club with a cocaine lab the businesses unlock additional missions and it s all great but also very daunting because every little upgrade costs a fortune and it will take a long time until i can access all that the game has to offer i guess i ll keep playing for longer than i thought which can be a good thing as long as it keeps being fun instead of a grindfest in the meantime i had an encounter with my first hacker who threw bags of money at me i left the session right away the next day i played again and everything was normal
