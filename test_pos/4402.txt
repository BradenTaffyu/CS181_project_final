2017 warframe a space ninja parkour games this game is one of the best f2p games but is it worth to download this is my opinion pros many characters a k a warframe to use a tons of weapon to use sword shotgun rifle etc good graphics gore elements you can turn off the gore elements too a space ninja parkour big community completing quest is rewarding not pay to win still got awesome update badass looking warframecons a lot of grinding a lot monoton gameplay mastery rank takes a long time to level up wanna make your warframe or weapon look cool buy platinums usin real money weapon slot upgrade use platinum connection issue that is my opinion for this game overall this is a great game if you doesnt have any problem with grinding because many people quit playing this game because grinding my final verdict of this game is 9 10i highly recommended this game especially if you love mmo
