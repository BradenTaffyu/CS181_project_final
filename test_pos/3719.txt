2018 rockstar managed to almost fix the annoying and eternal loading screens i ve been playing since the launch day and the game besides the new added content whether be good or not has been improved and optimized also they backed off with that extremely bad decision about banning openiv last year i would recommend this game to anyone make friends join a lobby together and have fun because you can do a lot of stuff in there
