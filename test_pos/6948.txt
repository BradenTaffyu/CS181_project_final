2017 we re talking zombies okay kayzombies has never had this much content and been this cohesive the maps are all fairly strong entries my personal favorite being gorod krovi i will admit i still have not completed the easters eggs on all the maps but i good taste for the gameplay experiences i would be having on all the maps shadow of evil is a great eldritch snack of a map just about everything helps this sucker function as a pretty seamless sandbox for the new mechanics of the game it s a bit on the easy side as are all the maps in black ops 3 but they all are consistently interesting the questline to get to the packapunch is probably my favorite of any map on offer the wonder weapon is pretty godlike the dog rounds are fine the new creatures flies and meatballs are okay the meatballs being especially hard sometimes but really if you re decent at zombies they pose little to no threat der eisendrache is map i ve just about fully experienced and most of what i have to say is meh the bows are all sort of annoyingly underdesigned aestetically in terms of mechanics they re just sorta powerful not too interesting and not so powerful i love them the easter egg this one i ve actually completed was really a chore more than something fun though completing it did feel pretty dang good the map looks okay but the snow kissed castle is just a little bit normal to me it d be cooler if it was just a little bit more freaky a bit more closed in too castle wolfestein and it s easy as pie and only half as sweet zetsubou no shima a black sheep in the lineup and not without reason but like all these maps there are unique gameplay concepts that they approach pretty confidently even it still comes out a little funny the generator and underwater stuff is pretty dang cool it weaves well in the core of the game underwater rather than being a burdeon feels kind freeing though you must surface for water the boss monsters were kind of annoying but they got easier i don t hate the wonder weapon either the easter egg design is really lazy and is based on chance how hard it is going to be to complete which i ve never beaten but tried for days it s an okay map gorod krovi difficult goodness a bit more oldschool which is a good thing the intro cutscene is kind terrible which goes for all of them but shadows of evil they re just a little bit rushed like it feels like one two layers of audio are missing ppsh is back again goodness the wunder weapon is strong and versataile i ve honestly not experienced all of this map but so far it s pretty good revelations is an interesting patchwork of many previous maps in the treyarch branch of zombies it s pretty good but it really is just an idea rather than a truly great map the areas don t flow well enough into each other to really warrant them to be smashed up as one making the gameplay feel rather segmented the wunder weapons though are in full force sporting multiple from previous maps which make the map super easy but also pretty fun i love you thunder gun good map great concept awesome gunsthe workshop tons of free fanmade maps what s not to love part of the reason i bought the game after vowing not to purchase cod ever again workshops are the way to my heart now for my obligatory number score i almost never give them to videogames in earnest but here it is8 10 if you ve liked previous zombies buy the game check out the maps there s some fun to be had story to be enjoyed just don t expect something as good as bo1 zomboners
