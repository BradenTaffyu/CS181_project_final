2022 this game lies somewhere between the bees knees and really bad its got a lot of interesting unique stuff going for it cool lords with fantastic voice acting specifically kairos imo cool factions amazing visuals especially with the corruption for the four chaos fellas and a kickass soundtrackit also has some pretty bad performance on campaign map as well as unit movement bugs crashes here and there and some weird design choices that make the main story goal of the game a little unbearablei rate this review positive only because i can get through the negatives and appreciate the positives a tiny sprinkle of copium and i absolutely love the source material
