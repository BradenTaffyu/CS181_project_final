i ll be blunt and say it the story in this game is atrociously bad the dialogue the story itself the way the events unfold it s all terrible and the lead up to the final boss fight is probably one of the worst i ve ever seen in any game this game has horrible fps problems months after launch however it does seem like setting the program priority to high and playing in fullscreen helps quite a bit on my 2070 and that s everything bad about the game literally everything else is phenomenal the graphics are great i love the artstyle character customization is good class variety is certainly far from lacking i mean the playstyles you can get out of this game alone not even considering the world design or insanely fun combat while this game has its flaws if you can look past the bad story and fps this game truly is a hidden gem my god is this game fun there s nothing more entertaining than climbing on a dragon s back as it flies hundreds of feet up into the sky just to shake you off and have you fall to your death despite its issues i think dragon s dogma 2 is a fantastic game and if you re a fan of rpgs and if you can ignore the bad story i m sure you ll love this game too ps ignore all the people talking about microtransactions everything sold is very easily earned in game by simply playing the microtransactions are there for truly lazy gamers or people that are easily tricked scammed
