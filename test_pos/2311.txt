2022 i m so trash at this game but i can t stop playing it hard stuck gold because boomer hands and i feel like a damned imposter just soloing sitting at the very bottom of plat 4 ranked in this game can be very toxic but honestly the experience is worth it by virtue of how flashy the fights are playing apex is like if everyone were a raze main in valorant i ve met and queued with some wonderful people in pubs so i guess that balances out the toxicity by a fair amount on top of being a flashy game apex hands down has one of the best battle passes in most modern shooters other games have bps that feel like a sludgefest to complete and just don t give you enough breathing room in case you have to miss a few days here and there in contrast you can start the apex bp late complete it through various modes complete it further with the help of limited timed events that provide extra stars levels to your bp and you can definitely finish it with weeks to spare my favorite part about this hero shooter is how the impact of movement is definitely more pronounced and plays a large role in winning games i main raze in valorant and i just loved the transition from that kind of aerial maneuvering to the plethora of movement techniques you see in apex tap strafing bhopping walljumping super grapples etc it just hits different compared to slower tactical shooters and i love it great game there is no substitute for this kind of fun
