2022 i nominated this for steam s game of the year it really is something special now that the immortal empires campaign is playable there have been a lot of qol improvements since the 2nd game and some new mechanics of course the big thing that was new were the new campaigns which no one but me seemed to like but now that the big campaign is here everyone is happy i ve gone in depth on previous tww reviews on how perfect warhammer is for total war and i don t feel like going down that path again but these are two great franchises that were perfectly designed for one another and there are so many different factions and units that it seems there is always something new to do in the game i ll be playing this for years to come as i did tww2
