2019 as a long time chinese wf player it hurts my hearts to see all these negative reviews left in the past week it s unfortunate that the volunteer translator has been removed due to leaking information and insulting de members de has yet to justify these things the volunteer has worked for de for almost 5 years and he contributed so much for the fan base by providing quality contents about the the game and attracts more chinese player the chinese community loves his translations and the translation actually made sense rather than some machine translated junk it s a loss for both de and the chinese player base we will definitely have worse user experience but if he really did leak the information we all know how de handles those things i love the game and i don t think it deserves these negative ratings i hope my fellow chinese players be rational and let de and the volunteer handles things privately wf
