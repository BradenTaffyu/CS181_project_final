2021 apex legends was the first battle royale game i put more than 1 hour into normally i don t play these types of games they re just not something i personally enjoy all too much but apex legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so i was able to semi consistently have someone to play with which is amazing putting in almost 20 hours i feel confident enough to say i ve formed an opinion about it so this review is just that do i think apex legends is good honestly yes i do i didn t expect it but i ve been so far enjoying apex legends quite a bit there are gripes i have with the game but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not my answer would be a solid yes if that s enough to convince you good hope you go on to enjoy the game for the rest who want to hear more read on gameplay there are a lot of aspects about apex legends that i enjoy when talking about gameplay so let s break them down point by point gun playthe guns in apex are satisfying to use most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying if i had to compare it to anything oddly enough i d choose to compare it to tf2 the gun play is rock solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage for example is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say hey i died but i had fun not everything is perfect though one of my least favorite mechanics in any first person shooter is bullet drop off and apex has that i can understand why for the sake of balance so that someone with an smg can t just snipe across the map but even at mid range it just feels clunky and annoying on top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless prime examples for me would be most energy weapons and most shotguns their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use while this would be good in a tactical shooter in counter strike or something in a fast paced battle royale like apex i just don t think they work very well and they aren t anywhere near as appealing as a sniper rifle or an lmg i now understand why there s memes about shotguns in this game being bad it s because they just really don t fit in with the way this game wants you to play it to clarify i m not saying they re useless i m just saying that other options will get you results faster more efficiently abilitiesthis game s abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and i feel like they aren t integrated into gameplay properly it s the one thing that i dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you re getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once but perhaps that could be seen as a good thing as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent but this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others most of the time i end up playing bloodhound lifeline because they re conceptually super simple and easy to grasp whereas characters like wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not overall though i appreciate that this game doesn t make it so you need to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you can use if you need it movementi love this game s movement mechanics being based on the source engine of all things it s no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics moving around flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels really good and during fights movement can either be the make or break of an encounter the only complaint in regards to movement i have concern a specific legend pathfinder his standard grapple ability depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple once you get the hang of it it s super satisfying but man does it feel awkward initially monetization this is a free to play game it s natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they ve created the one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher ea the worst possible one given this fact how s the monetization in this game honestly i m incredibly mixed on it lemme go into detail why dlcthe dlc is stupidly overpriced for what it offers the steam reviews reflect that 30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price the other dlc definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer honestly i m hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it s just a shame altogether i d personally avoid the dlc if i were you unless it goes on a 50 off sale at some point if ever lootboxesi think the lootbox system in apex is pretty okay i m not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best apex legends lootboxes offer 100 cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon character skins from what i ve gathered they don t do limited time lootbox drops so they re avoiding making the consumer feel fomo which is a welcome addition in other words they re there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and i really appreciate that battle passthis is one thing i actively dislike about this game s monetization system purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like reach level 25 to unlock this skin only for you to reach level 25 and the game tells you buy premium to get this skin at which point i just wanna tell the game to off the battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium battle pass i actively dislike that graphics sound optimization how are the other aspects of the game graphicsfor being developed on the source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it the game looks great not outstanding or stunning but still visually appealing and eye catching some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often i found myself staring at insanely low res textures only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones it s not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something i noticed regardless soundthe sound music of apex is good the guns sound great the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying the music isn t anything outstanding nothing that sticks in my mind so i don t really have much to comment great to have in the background during non crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute forget about the voice acting is okay does the job the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to optimizationi think the game could use some work in this department i frequently notice random frame drops also mentioned the texture loading thing but as a whole the game doesn t seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate it s just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying conclusion there are more things i wanna talk about but i have to cut it due to the steam character limit overall apex legends surprised me being that it s satisfyingly fun looks great but the monetization system optimization could use some work if you were on the fence about trying it you should try it and see if you like it
