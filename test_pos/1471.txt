2023 tl dr solid title still has a couple of issues but overall a huge improvement from tw warhammer 2 one of the suits said a really foolish thing and the company vastly misallocated resources changing lanes trying to tap into a market they had no business being in which probably caused the issues on launch day i d get this one on sale the i ve got time review are the c suites running the company into the ground it would appear so but aside from valve itself there are few aaa gaming industry companies who are not doing the same in 2023 they sega and or c a were dazzled by how much cod and battlefield rake in and wanted a piece of that pie what they should have done with that 50 million is convince games workshop to let them make a non lore related total war warhammer unchained or whatever title but some sort of nod to the fan favorite and very entertaining un sets from mtg with 1 randomized maps with many different world gen protocols 2 no faction has any inherit disdain for any other faction 3 random start spots with a function to let players teams start close to one another if desired only just recently gotten tw w3 and having been playing tw w2 up until that day there are a lot of improvements still no move all units separate from end turn button like shogun 2 had pros i can think of off the top of my head simultaneous turns in multiplayer 10 10 quick deals 10 10 separate button appears when ally player sends you a deal 10 10 being able to recruit allied faction s units 10 10 being able to just disable any notification you find annoying 10 10 being able to move while in ambush stance 10 10 ai doesn t spam under passage 10 10 different factions rise to great power 10 10gripes the little check box in the upper right of an army lords panel should be ignore this lord s notifications as opposed to always show this lord s notifications it s really annoying having to garrison an army somewhere then every turn click through that notification because i want to know when my other lord stopped moving it s just a bit backwards is all instead of making me click the disable notifications then any army i want to keep tabs on just let me click the army i want to ignore as i said before there is still no move all heroes lords button i would like them to move before i end my turn not both at the same time overall performance needs to be more polished lots of stutters mid battle and freezing issues from some we aren t using some obscure hardware off of wish either we all have among the 10 most common gpu s according to steam s surveys also the host of games seems to load in last by about 30 to 60 seconds every time we load up the world map not sure what that s about does my experience discount from the experiences many went through from launch day up until to a few months ago no games should be released in a far better state than this was should a c suite say the quiet part out loud also no we all know that if a company does not take in enough revenue the company dies it is up to that company to provide a product worth buying in the first place that s econ 100 stuff we are not just cash cows you milk when you want to buy another beach house or another fleet of super cars gaming for me seems to be turning from oh boy the new title came out it s gonna be great to a somber i better wait a year or 2 for the game to be actually enjoyable
