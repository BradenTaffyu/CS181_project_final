2021 on a scale of frustrating roguelikes noita is firmly on the i want to punch a hole in my wall end you need to be patient to play this the core appeal of noita is of course the falling everything engine it works perfectly every pixel is simulated every pixel interacts with everything else and it all runs smoothly where noita really starts to shine is the kinds of things the game does with the engine basically everything you can think of is in the game liquids powders and objects react with each other and produce new materials or explosions in all sorts of ways along with realistic materials like water blood acid there s a bunch of magical liquids that have their own effects and reactions shovel gallons of worm blood down your gaping noita hole and see through walls melt steel with concentrated mana inherent to a system like this is a bit of jank sometimes your character gets blocked by a single pixel of terrain you can barely see or gets set on fire by a single pixel of lava it happens less often than you d honestly expect but often enough that it can be irritating sometimes the enemies and spells in the game similarly do almost everything you could think of there s mages that bleed lava and teleporting liquid there s flying crystals whose bodies are made of actual simulated pixels there s a guy who just has a shotgun the spells consist of everything from standard projectiles and stat boosts to spells that launch live worms summon seas of liquid and a straight up nuke you ll find yourself gravitating towards certain spells more often but they ve all got their uses cons noita is rng heavy in ways that are more frustrating than fun your max hp which basically acts like a pseudo timer letting you stay in an area until you ve taken too much damage and need to get the heal at the start of the next area is based on max hp pickups that spawn completely at random you can get a massive head start if one spawns right at the beginning of the run or get zero spawned in an entire zone healing spells similarly spawn completely at random and are extremely powerful if you get them the core gameplay loop of exploring till you ve taken too much damage and then entering the next area to get a full heal breaks down outside the main path of the game over half the game s content is outside the main path but there s like three places you can get a heal in all of it so you either find one of those randomly spawning heal spells or run out of hp and are just like guess i ll die overall brilliant concept for a game generally good execution with a few hiccups not for people who can t handle frustration difficult games or getting one shot after a three hour run because a puddle of polymorphine turned you into a sheep it s fun give it a shot
