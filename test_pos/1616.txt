2023 tldr company uses scummy marketing practice tons of dlc s and they re getting more pricey but game is great lots of fun all around although a much different experience from the historical titles i have over 1000 hours combined between the three total war warhammer games at the time of writing this review this is a game review look i get it everyone s pissed me included that ca is milking the crap out of this game but these reviews are supposed to talk about the game not the company right so if you re reading this keep in mind most reviews are just people angry with ca which again i totally understand and feel similar so the game in itself i think is really great i m not much of a fan of the other campaigns but immortal empire is still as much fun to me as it was in warhammer 2 for those new immortal empire means all the three games maps and factions are combined into one epic experience clashing and forging alliances and then backstabbing to paint the map in your colour the essence of what makes this game great are the big monsters clashing in epic battles where thousands of troops fight eachother as up to 40 units on each side are allowed on the field i love the unique gameplay most legendary lords bring to the table and the fact all the different factions have their own flavors and mechanics and sometimes differ wildy from one another as in ways their economy fonctions and what kind of troops they use and fighting style they must adapt to overcome their opponents they did change the sieging mechanics one of the biggest complaints from warhammer 2 which in my opinion is a very welcome change though it is true some less important major cities could use a bit of work i am otherwise a fan of what they made with the minor settlements i quite enjoy playing those another somewhat less important feature they added in this last game is the fact that now you can actually purchase units from other factions through alliances so if you ve ever played some empire but also wanted to bring some dragons in your roster you just have to ally some elves to me the graphics look great the sounds and music are good too i can t state enough how much i love watching the battlefield littered with dead bodies when the fight is over seeing where my enemies perished from artillery barrages or from towering monstrosities or even from some devastating spell casting i must admit i m not one to play much in multiplayer pvp but i did play with one of my buddy in a couple of coop campaigns and honnestly it is really one of the best thing ever as stated earlier this game will require a bunch of dlc s for you to enjoy it to the fullest from this one and the previous games because they all sync together in immortal empires yes it is a lot of money but for my part i ve been buying those here and there since the first game i would recommend waiting for those heavy franchise sales on steam to get the dlc s you really want first previous games and faction dlc s for example if i m not mistaken you can still play a campaign and encounter every other faction in the game without owning their dlc s as a side note another great thing for those of you who enjoy spicing up their games the modders community seems pretty great for this game lots of good work being done all around i don t really write reviews but i thought this game deserved it as i m seeing so many bad reviews lately i definitely missed some stuff but this game will probably stay as one of my favorite game of all time
