pros character design is very good made me learn how to play with one hand maps are decent albeit sometimes hard to navigate in the gameplay is fun cons nexon will probably abandon the game in like 3 months the grind can get really repetitive and annoying real quick unless you re familiar with korean mmos in general then you probably hate yourself enough to not care as much story is laughably bad the devs could have honestly went to a random dnd discord server and asked for a much better story to be written for them in 10 minutes there edit after the season 1 invasion update i m no longer recommending the game as with the invasions nexon forgot the game is an mmo invasions are single player only and most importantly they forgot to make it actually fun the new character hailey is also insultingly annoying to farm
