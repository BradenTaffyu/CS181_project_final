warframe where being a space ninja isn t just a job it s a lifestyle dive into this game and you ll find yourself wall running like a caffeinated squirrel shooting enemies with weapons that look like they belong in a sci fi fever dream and customizing your warframe so much you ll forget what your actual warframe looks like the only thing faster than your warframe s maneuvers is the speed at which updates drop ensuring you ll never run out of new stuff to confuse your friends with just when you think you ve mastered it all a new expansion drops reminding you that in warframe the only constant is chaos and that s why we love it rating 9 10 for sheer ninja absurdity
