2020 what can i say other than that this game blew my expectations out of the water get it good sea of thieves is by far the most fun i ve had playing a video game since my early days of halo 3 world of warcraft cod4 and other classics this game takes multiplayer to another level by seamlessly combining both story and procedurally based quests with high intensity high stakes pve and pvp battles often both happening at once many other multiplayer games try to make online play feel like it s a living breathing world inhabited by the players but no other games in my opinion even comes close to the feeling that you get in sot combat in all areas feels great with a high skill cap and relatively straightforward mechanics players are highly incentivized to get good every single time i ve died had my ship sank or lost all my loot has been my fault the other player was better no questions asked you can pull off some sick in this game if you re a skilled player and the game encourages you to do it with completely overpowered gunpowder barrels and even stronger stronghold gunpowder barrels a single player acting alone can take down an entire galleon of 4 other players on it if they re experienced enough with a deep understanding of the mechanics a well thought through plan and bit of pirate luck any player can become a terror of the seas let s talk bugs there aren t many it seems that the development team is actively looking to stomp anything that would cause immersion break and they re damn good at it there are the occasional issues that slip through the beta tests and into the live server in the most recent patch there seems to have been an issue introduced that when a ship collides with a landmass and then gets pushed off of the landmass the ship still things it s in contact with something this causes the ship to moan and creak like it s rubbing up against rocks and sounds quite horrible but causes no damage to the ship i also think it slows you down until the effect wears off but that is not confirmed however even this issue is not that big of a deal it was surprising the first couple times and then i got used to it and learned to stop running into things unless i m trying to run into something in which case it s a tactical pirate maneuver the artistic direction in this game is phenomenal hands down i cannot even begin to describe how absolutely stunning some of the views in sea of thieves are sailing across a pristine ocean that glows with the most beautiful blue while the sun sets and the sky is and explosion of orange surrounded by a transition to a perfect blue sky and fluffy white clouds is just another day in sot the atmosphere of this game is a magnificent combination of hyper stylized graphics and incredible sound design which makes for an almost unbelievable at times gaming experience you won t soon forget i m so in love with the art in this game i ve spent almost 50 on aesthetics alone and i ve only been playing it for 28 hours but that brings me on to my last point the price point if you saw 50 and felt the trauma of old archeage coming to haunt you fear not this game only has cosmetic options for sale on the cash shop not only that most items will cost you around 5 the more high end items will set you back about 40 but that is money well spent in my opinion as a general rule of thumb i do not spend more money on games than the price of the game itself i am not someone who buys cosmetics or toys because it is just not worth it to me this game is completely different and you better believe i bought an entire ship overhaul with the collectors edition items and i did it happily these developers have 100 earned my money and i will gladly continue to support this game financially as long as i m enjoying it sea of thieves is a 10 10 for me and i highly recommend you try it
