2021 very fun game especially if you play it with the right people great mixture of pvp pve and stories even tho sometimes pvp can get annoying if your getting chased by reapers for hourse for no loot at all the devs just keep on adding free content on a regular basis i d really recommend buying it best probably if it is on sale
