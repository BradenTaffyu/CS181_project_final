2016 i wanted to take the time and explain all of the content on the game so buyers can make an informed purchase as many know since there are 3 different makers of the game the gameplay and content can change drastically between them this game is made by treyarc if you do not follow them they are the original creators of zombies and often regarded as the best of the three now for the review campaign the campaign allows for 4 different difficulties ranging from beginner to holy sh the game allows for multiplayer campaign which is a huge plus and a lacking feature from the years previous which i really enjoy the graphics are what you would expect from such a large franchise so i won t go into detail there in the game you are outfitted with a chip in your brain which allows you to interpret various things very quickly and also give you advantages such as hacking robots and or causing them to self destruct the overall gameplay is not the best seen in the years of call of duty but it is well made smooth frame rates provide a really good experience overall the game doesn t allow you to skip cut scenes and many are pretty long i particularly like following the story however this could get old for some one the campaign is complete it opens a new mode which is a zombie story mode i personally am really excited about this however due to the long story mode and attempting it on realistic i have not made it that far yet i will update my review when i reach that area of the game edit the cut scenes are in fact skip able and when playing a mission on realistic it is best to play with friends even when with friends a single mission will take on the order of 1 2 hours depending on the mission the zombie story mode is a lot of fun and depending on the difficulty you select can be very very challenging at the beginning of a level there will be a mystery box it s actually very well done in how they incorporate random things that have become a staple in the zombie mode i was anxious to reach the zombie story mode but was a bit reserved in thinking it might not be laid out very well it is in fact is even more fun than the main story line in my opinion i wont include any spoilers for those who haven t played either story line but the game play is amazing multiplayer the multiplayer is standard call of duty but has the addition of a super power and wall running i particularly don t care for the wall running or double jump and all that fancy stuff but if it must be added to the game then it is much better than the exo suit from last years call of duty the map designs are really nice for multiplayer and the overall game play feels very balanced depending on play style edit i have actually come to enjoy the wall running mechanics unlike previously stated it takes some getting use to but once you jump on a wall to begin wall running go ahead and aim down the sights and its a good method the sneak over to a player and get the kill before he realizes where you are the super powers that you can select from are a very nice touch while some are way more useful than others i personally prefer the annihilator its a one shot one kill pistol and if you are an accurate shot then this is a must try it is very effective and impossible to defend if you are accurate miss a shot however and the very slow reload will most likely render you dead zombies disclaimer i love zombies the first and only map of black ops 3 is amazing it s a huge map with many things to explore in place of dogs however there are these bat like creatures that come every 5 rounds or so also as you increase in rounds a octopus like boss arrives and will chase you he really isn t a big deal easy to kill but more and more of these boss like creatures will begin to spawn each round there are a few new additions such as gum balls and a new perk i won t explain every detail but if you are a fan of zombies then you will enjoy the new map make sure to google how to find the perks as there are busted bottles that will explain the best direction to travel towards to get the desired perk in order to turn on power etc you will need to become the beast which is ok i guess it s new and different but not sure how i feel about it yet i will say this though it s much better than the bus map that black ops 2 came with good luck easter egg hunting i will add that if you are playing with a group of 4 i have found a very good strategy that will allow you to reach the higher rounds and each have their own circle once you open pack a punch room one player stays in there while another is just outside pack a punch while remaining in the rift as long as you have opened all the rifts the other 2 players can simultaneously run the boxing ring circle this will allow one to face forward and clear the path while the other is opening fire to clear the zombies chasing you ok so that s a quick rundown of the changes and what to expect please do not downvote cause you are a fanboy or hate the game and do not agree with what i said i am attempting to inform buyers of the changes and what to expect although some is my opinion of course i tried to give an honest review with no bias update 03 10 16 so i have had a lot of time playing the game now and have unlocked everything that you can basically for the price of the game you are getting 2 full length story modes normal and zombie the standard call of duty multiplayer with the addition of powers and wall running and a massive zombie map that offers a ton of replayablility honestly treyarc killed it with this game although its not perfect since there are still glitches such as the game randomly freezing causing you to start a 2 hour mission over as well as a few other annoyances i highly highly recommend this game to those that are on the fence imo this is the best multiplayer experience to come from the call of duty franchise in a long time
