don t listen to the gaming karens the game is great there are areas that can be improved like multiplayer connections which seem to be buggy at the moment however the story visuals and flow of the game is all excellent if you liked games like gears of war the previous space marine or similar games you will love this one as well but don t be fooled the game on the intended difficulty is not easy
