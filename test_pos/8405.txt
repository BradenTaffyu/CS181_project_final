2023 it s overall very very well done and currently the best non formsoft souls out there with a few missteps and minor disappointments the good things runs well looks good sounds good music ambient vo and effects enemy variety is sufficient bosses mostly extremly fun more on that later pacing is pleasant weapon building is fun and encourages experimantaionthe disappointments a little bit too linear while the areas are complex in it self varied enough and level design overall is good there aren t any forks for you to decide where to go next in a greater sense think of old yarnham or the forest in bloodborne appearently no hidden areas or bosses aside maybe vom ng stuff not quite there yet now there still is great benefit found in exploring as you find usefull items weapons costume or upgrade materials just not so much big things to discover aside from one short cave i foundthe bad things while i managed with the parry window given it s could be a bit looser imo the game would still be hard but a tiny bit less stressfull and while some enemies and even some bosses are perfectly beatable with only gurad or dodging some fights do kind of demand it dodge from ground and i framig fury attacks should not be progress equipment locked no the fury attack dodge would be fine again if the parrys where just a tiny little bit more lenient for the last area too many high hp mobs now the path through that area is quite long already and having multiple rooms with multiple 4 5k hp mobs just drags on for so so so long they don t have to deal less damage or even be placed different just cut some of their hp currently the last stage felt as long as 2 3 pervious areas combined update they nerfed trash hp in the endgame no longer an issue update 2 dodging from the ground is now standard the last two bosses are a bit over designed if people are freaking out about the first few bosses boy they won t see that coming now again dmg wise it s kinda fine on it s own but they have so much attacks which wind up so similiar to each other you never know in what combo state they actually are in right now so finding gaps to attack ist extremly hard the last boss has 2 main attacks the can chain into something like 6 7 different outcomes while also summoning delayed lingering attacks in the arena that randomly fly towards you making some setups almost unavoidable when you are not super cautious now if reducing move variety is not that easy or wanted by the devs at all reducing dmg would also be welcome just so that you have a better chance at learing a 50 moves broad attack patternupdate the last boss s hp were nerfed making the fight more enjoyable and easier to learn as you don t have to fight phase 1 for as long to get used to phase 2 i still hope they patch the balance in the last area a bit just to round out the experience then again if fromsoft can get away with malenia and orphan maybe these bosses are fine as well could be more fun though if they were to be tuned down just a bit given they are not optional like malenia update they did adress the flow of the game overall pretty good state now would recommend more if i could
