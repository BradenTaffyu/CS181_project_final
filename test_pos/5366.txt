2021 i installed this game after my friend told me that it was really fun and enjoyable he said it was really tactical and those are the type of games i enjoy the most i can truly say that r6s is the best shooter game i have ever played in all my time if not the best game i have ever played collecting the first operators and discovering what they have in store is an exciting experience tactically winning games with your friends is a thrill that only this game can produce in such a way the only concern and annoyance in the game is that all the dlc operators will probably cost real life money to require unless you are willing to put in many days into the games because they are very expensive in game the game is really competitive and at time you may become frustrated but with time you will improve and rise in the ranks the casual game mode can be toxic at times but most of the time it is a great way of playing the game but in short periods when you don t have much time or want to play more relaxed every 3 months or so they introduce 2 new operators which refreshes the game and creates a hype it keeps the game flowing bringing in new dynamics with the new abilities the new operators may have overall everyone must buy this game and join the experience because otherwise your missing out on a whole new world in this game
