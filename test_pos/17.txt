the game is warhammer 40k through and through grim dark and gritty the story is good and introduces you to why titus got turned into a primaris well for the obvious culture war question no it is not woke combat is violent and satisfying a similar experience to what i recently had with batman arkham knight it is challenging countering dodging and learning patterns etc but it is more simplified here when you play as titus you feel like a space marine the power of the melee attacks ripping enemies limb from limb the shaking footsteps where you can feel the weight behind every step the thunderous boom as so much armour meat bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge started the game on hardest difficulty and it is very challenging still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots edit seems possible but is very challenging would only suggest angel of death difficulty for the most dedicated players shooting is also satisfying but can t be completely relied on engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40k sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle music is dark and 100 fits 40k theme the main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back awe inspiring after a quick look operations and endless war mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity edit operations is thoroughly enjoyable levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful the artists really put effort into them on technical and performance the game is running beautifully rtx 3060 i7 10700k 32gb ram ssd windows 11 ultra settings native resolution 1080p with taa gives 40 60 frames lowest frames i ve experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions considering my hardware is not high end the performance was surprising to me it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion the game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40k fan s attention some are saying it has epic the game makes use of epic online services not an app just core components that allow crossplay between steam and epic as well as the needed files for easy anti cheat no epic account was required when i started the game and none created that i am aware of a couple of technical issues i can t figure out sometimes voice lines are normal then barely audible with subtitles it isn t too much of a problem but if playing without them you strain to hear them the most glaring problem is that the so called anti cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others that alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in pve and pvp couldn t join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution will update review if i find one or find the cause edit i was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts but connecting isn t reliable and sometimes doesn t work edit no crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo different primary than the one you chose along the mission meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint this happened to me on severance mission when activating generators with ripper swarms gaunts zoanthropes and warriors mobbing me unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch
