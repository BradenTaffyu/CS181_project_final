2015 its 2015 and it s another call of duty not recommended to mid to low end pc users as it does have major performance issues regardless if the beta ran fine on your computer however it s still basically better then advance warfare in terms of gameplay long story short the multiplayer is broken so this is the following game set after black ops 2 the campaign is solid and predictable towards the main plot and overall deserves an average rating of a 6 10 now comes the multiplayer which we all are waiting for so first off these are things i see people arguing about during a match the main hype for the game is the zombie mode guys i bet you some people got this game for the zombie mode and i tell you it ain t like bo2 transit and the overall season pass for the giant map i give you all a basic overall on the game and let you all decide on it the good they gave us dedicated severs as promised and this sure limited the amount of game lag experienced online promising 3 game modes to play along with split screen for sharing experiences with friends for co op easter eggs for shadows of evil and in depth detail towards plot and story line flexible movement system which flows to movement compared to the exo movement game customisation such as camo uses attachment overview and in game sharing for features in other modes zombie mode unlock mode after completing the campaign theatre mode returns after 3 years workshop support with moding tools the bad the graphical lag when setting to quality over performance needs to be patched sluttering lag and low fram drops 1 game launch mode for steam personal season pass again for later dlc spams important no one likes supply drops and stop selling them bland campaign story mode predictable whats f ucking broken as usual the balancing of smgs in cod is broken for eg i notice that majority of the smg users tend to stick towards the vmp and vesper these gun needs balancing as towards bo3 gameplay focus on a ads play style and people would normally hip fire due to the high fire rate of these smgs when compared to the huge spread when hip fire with other weapons people will realise what s the actual play style of bo3 well at the moment a few maps have an overall flow and balance to spawns and movement maps like infection redwood have no reason to exist in this game does anybody think they are so similar to maps in ghost it s a bad idea for too much vegetation it s like snow related maps like the past mw2 derail and mw3 outpost there is just something missing about the game when compared to black ops 2 guys if you can give me more broken elements i can update the review and tag ur name in the review so personally its just what you feel about call of duty lets face it and be honest that they should give it a rest after this game
