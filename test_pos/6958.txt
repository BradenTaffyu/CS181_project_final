2020 while i do recommend the game it s most fun with friends campaign is a joke but its co op multiplayer is ehh but its more fun with friends zombies is where this game truly shines its fun solo but its more fun with friends the campaign is pretty crap doesn t connect at all to the previous campaigns apart from a few small mentions and doesn t feel as fun no wonder it s the least completed campaign in cod history the multiplayer is hit or miss either you love the advanced movement or you hate it you aren t really likely to find many games nowadays however the zombies is where this game truly shines each of the maps is crafted with so much love and care treyarch even decided to bring back a bunch of bo1 maps in zombie chronicles as well as origins for those who played bo2 black ops 3 maps are a lot more complex and difficult to set up on than any previous game but once you ve actually set up it is fairly easy to survive each map is unique has a unique setting and provides a unique gameplay experience easter eggs are prevelant like always but they re a lot harder this time around you ll have to practice the zombie chronicles remasters were incredibly effective at bringing a last gen level into next gen shangri la is my personal favourite design wise and they all still feel just as fun and distinct as they did in black ops 1 or 2 overall if you have friends who are rich get this game
