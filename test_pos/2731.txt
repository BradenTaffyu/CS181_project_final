2015 he sits on his ass all day smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that game if that s our standard for goodness then no wonder this country s screwed michael de santastory no spoilers grand theft auto v pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists michael a married man suffering from a midlife crisis franklin a gangster trying to make a change for himself and trevor who s just a canadian psychopath the trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades the game is action packed with chases gang shootouts and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on when you re not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks you can partake in all sorts of activities you can walk your dog chop go golfing play tennis and even get a lap dance at the strip club sorry roman there s no bowling gta online the gta online protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize gender or appearance the player will choose a gender then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his her appearance then the player chooses how much the character spends his her daily life this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance after you have finished creating your character you arrive in los santos with an open welcome by lamar davis especially if you re a female he then has you do a street race with him and other new players if available and shows you to gerald a drug runner who ll give you easy jobs to start you off in los santos after you complete this tutorial you ll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players who ll either become your friend or your enemy there are multiple game modes in online including free roam run around with up to 32 of your closest friends or enemies causing chaos and other nonsense you can also compete in mini games such as target practice arm wrestling golf and tennis if you don t like to be killed constantly by other players in free roam you can play in solo mode but you ll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player missions these are given out by characters in gtav lamar gerald martin etc and are co op jobs with up to 4 players survival try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players pvp there are multiple subsets of this including team deathmatch deathmatch free for all vehicle deathmatch team elimination you only have one life capture a twist to capture the flag objective based missions complete a objective while the enemy team tries to do the same races and parachuting heists these are my personal favourite with up to three of your friends friends are highly recommended unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles unlike basic jobs these heists involve multiple sub jobs within them called heist setups that must be completed prior to the heist finale as the heist leader you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life or none at all if the dificulty is above normal and if that life is expended the current mission fails and you ll have to restart it there are multiple glitches in gta online some are funny and weird the others are exploits and game breaking so far i haven t seen any hackers but i wouldn t doubt their existence final verdictin retrospect i give grand theft auto v a 8 10 amazing story excellent gameplay fun with friends and fun without them great graphics gta editor heists are fun and replayable for more cash glitches now go i need to meditate or masturbate or both trevor phillips
