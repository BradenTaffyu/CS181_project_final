black myth wukong every review is subjective and aligns with the perception tastes preferences and or interests of the person writing it i m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression which is why i do not assign a score i don t believe art can be measured or quantified i ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible overall i found the game to be quite good for someone who hasn t read the story of journey to the west i really enjoyed how it s presented here especially the cinematics included in each chapter i ll just say that if you appreciate animation as a medium of cinematic expression you ll likely enjoy them as well i decided to purchase this game for two simple reasons dragon ball inspired by journey to the west and elden ring the first one is my past and the second is my present and the surprise was quite pleasant although the game was heavily touted as being similar to the souls like genre i only noticed two aspects the save points similar to bonfires or graces and the way some npcs stories are told characters who provide you with bits of information and whom you encounter repeatedly as you progress in terms of gameplay wukong is more akin to a hack and slash than a souls like you could reference god of war and perhaps sekiro i mean its progression system is broad and accesible it s frenetic challenging but above all fun what i didn t like is the lack of a parry mechanic there s only one mechanic that rewards you for dodging at the right time for me the game s strong point is the number and variety of bosses over 80 there s only one boss that repeats in design but not in its move set which i greatly appreciate the world of black myth is unique and beautiful with a different map for each chapter the downside is that at times it feels somewhat empty i think they could have placed more difficult enemies or additional content in certain areas as sometimes exploration doesn t feel as rewarding the music library is quite extensive and original with over 70 tracks most of which are very good my personal recommendations are celestial symphony nonsense if good and evil gain no due flames have paved my way destiny it was you monkey mind the greatest yaoguai where lies the path ahead and especially listen not my conclusion i highly recommend this game if you re a fan of accessible hack and slash games good graphics which for me aren t a major factor animation narrative that sometimes leaves out details oriental ambient music and above all chinese culture however i do not recommend the deluxe edition the content is entirely in game like the music and the items weapons and armor become completely obsolete after the first chapter this is one of the best games of the year and it could become the best hack and slash on steam but who knows ragnar k is coming
