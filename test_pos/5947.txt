2016 is it perfect no is it fun bloody hell yes this game isn t going to be for everyone odds are you are going to be helpless as a suvivor that s the point survivors are suppose to be helpless against a killer as a suvivor you don t play to win games you play to survive them and as a killer you play to do one thing and only one thing kill if you don t like being helpless against an unstopable killer if he finds you then odds are you aren t going to like dead by daylight but if you are smart then either the survivors or killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other pros playing as a slasher flick killer 3 of them with more in the works being a victim of a slasher flick escape death with skill maybe just dumb luck or die in soiled pants 4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other great use of sounds for information rng tile based maps 1 2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places but everything else will change every game games last 10 minutes on average cons some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair eyes as a killer or some janky movement with killers interacting with suvivors balance one killer is weaker than the other 2 windows close together can make near 100 safe zones for survivors depending on a few things some perks are rather annoying maybe a touch op games have no timers if someone wants to waste your time they can if they are good enough no communication it is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like steam teamspeak skype ect making a lobby as a killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill not from player counts mind you either another bug or a waiting list with strict first come first filled rules in short for 20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not
