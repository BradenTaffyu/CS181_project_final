2021 updatethe addition of the duviri paradox to warframe is a refreshing change of pace playing as the drifter in slower paced combat is an amazing experience and the scenery is stunning there are many secrets to discover in the world and it offers a lot of replayability however the game is marketed as a roguelite and i feel that my playthroughs were unnecessarily long i focused on side quests and finding secret chests to get buffs but i could have just rushed the main objective and beaten the run in 15 to 20 minutes there is no real challenge to it unlike a true rogue like genre i have not tried steel path but the enemies just have more health overall i love the story gameplay and environment but it s just too easy the good sidebefore we start i want to say that i am very difficult when it comes to games i usually play the same games for 5 10 hours and get bored with warframe and one of my records warframe what more to say 60 000 players since the last 24 hours on the pc platform only a cross platform cross progression to be announced by q4 2022 the new wars on december 15th a release of the games on mobile warframe is very present in the f2p community it is one of the only games that allow me to get everything without spending a dime but they got me with their 75 coupon the game allows us to trade weapon and armor blueprints with other players in exchange for platinum platinum is the paid currency the purchase of platinum is therefore optional warframe has evolved well since 2013 is graphics have improved the particles and the special effects are always present to send your retina to the purgatory the company recently added directx12 and an enhanced mode in the graphics which makes a great difference in terms of graphics the music is wonderful no complaints on the other hand the sound of hearing the grineer agonizing for hours in survival mode makes my ears bleed warframe offers more than 24 game modes arena assassination assault capture defection defense disruption excavation exterminate free roam bounty plains of eidolon orb vallis cambion drift hijack infested salvage interception junction mobile defense pursuit exclusive to archwing rescue rush exclusive to archwing sabotage sanctuary onslaught skirmish exclusive to railjack spy survival volatile exclusive to railjack the bad sidewhen we start warframe the story is a bit vague it takes some time to fully understand what is going on in the system the cutscenes of the main quests will help you understand the story the difficulty is variable i had no difficulty in advancing in the game you just have to read your mods the steel path on the other hand hard mode is quite a challenge if you are not prepared in terms of game progression it is quite smooth the mastery lever rises quickly for the first 12 ranks 30 legendary in total but after it s very slow but you should not focus on it and make a fixation the weapons are long to craft waiting system going from 12h to 72h for warframe there is the possibility of moving the time forward with platinum but i don t think that is worth it for shooter looter addicts you won t regret it give warframe a chance the first moment may be confusing for my last negative point which is personal and subjective for everyone i do not like to play keyboard mouse at all warframe is a game that i play with my controller graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second live for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
