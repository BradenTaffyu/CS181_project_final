2020 depending on what background you set wallpaper engine only uses like 3 of your gpu when viewing the background and pretty much 0 1 when it s not in focus like when running a game cpu ram usage also depends on the chosen background and also surprisingly low the only thing you ll start feeling with any reasonably decent pc for games is storage space some wallpapers are simply video files on repeat some of these video s are easily 300mb you ll quickly have a big library of wallpaper you ve tried and they ll start eating gigabytes animated images are just 1 5mb generally though so it won t be much of a problem but something to keep in mind when you re running low pro tip always reserve at least 10 of free storage for all your devices low storage space makes devices noticebly slower community made wallpapers there s a load of them many are simple but your favorite game will probably be there and it s fairly easy to create your own now even better with the recent asset sharing update well worth the price there s simply no better alternative for fancy backgrounds don t underestimate the usage too backgrounds can be fully interactable games clocks and much more although there aren t that many games on there 10 10
