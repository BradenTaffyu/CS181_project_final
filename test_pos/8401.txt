i do not often leave reviews for games over the years i ve tried to fix that but i often come up short simply because i don t know if anyone will ever find it useful i tend to enjoy a lot of experiences that games have to offer that others may not simply because i am able to overlook flaws quite a lot when i am attached to something for those reasons i usually stray away from recommending something to strangers simply because i like it i do not need to worry about this for lies of p this game is very special to me but i have matured enough in recent years to know that parts of my opinions actually are beneficial to share even if its just to one person lies of p is special in many ways the most obvious of which is it s incredible execution of the souls like formula from a team completely independent from the developers that created and popularized the genre many may shove it off as a hollow imitation simply because it follows the structure but i think to do so is foolish it has it s own vision it s own identity and that makes it something to behold i have not played every fromsoftware souls game i finished elden ring dark souls currently finishing sekiro with plans to play all of them i think that s important to say but i feel comfortable saying that this is my favorite of the genre as it stands and it will be hard to beat simply because it gets so much of what i love from these games right and even puts more focus on things i think are lacking in other souls like games these things being but not limited to an incredible combat system that kept me engaged for all sixty hours i have played thus far a stunning art style that may not be for everyone but i enjoyed quite thoroughly a theme that struck me harder than i ever expected it to trust the vibe seriously it bangs a story i found genuinely engaging with people i cared about living in a world i found interesting a cat boss combat that rivals little other in my heart np my beloved 3 spoiler obviously mini bosses that kicked my ass more than the main ones sometimes a weapon system and weapons that i found so engaging and fun to play with i have never wanted to replay and try all these cool weapons more an incredible soundtrack some of the optional ones you can find have become mainstays in my playlist some qol that makes me feel so justified after all the complaining i have done in similar games cough bloodstains at the front of boss entrances cough all of that and more specifics that i will keep to myself to save your time and your experience if you have interest in this game or genre or even if you re just trying something new give lies of p a shot it deserves it and with the potential of dlc sequels i for one am beyond ready for a wild ride in the future i promise i am not lying
