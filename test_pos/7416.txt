dragon s dogma 2 is an awesome successor of dragon s dogma dark arisen but not perfect in my opinion it s a 7 5 10 so why does this game loses 2 5 in rating easy 1 5 for microtransactions which aren t that useful in my opinion 1 for an absolutly horrible performance which isn t fixed yeti finished my first playthrough in about 120 hours but that s not how long the story is going on i did a lot of exploring to get up to 120h
