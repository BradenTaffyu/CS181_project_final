i am malenia blade of miquella i still hear these words in my nightmares other than that i d recommend elden ring i m really bad at souls like games but still enjoy them can t dump 1000 hours into any of these games to git gud so i thought i would give elden ring a try i ve read that it s a bit more forgiving than dark souls or bloodborne still challenging but not in a git gud kinda way these articles and comments were right while i still struggled at a few points it never felt unfair and i was never stuck cause of elden ring s open world whenever a boss turned me into tomato paste 30 times in a row i turned around and progressed on a different route fighting a different boss defeating him getting stronger and returning to the other boss again i really enjoyed the game and i am looking forward to the dlc
