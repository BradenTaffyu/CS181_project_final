2022 as an old school player who has played cod since mw1 i love what they did with this game the campaign was brilliant and i love the fact that it pays homage to the older games the multiplayer is really solid so far and the maps are well thought out only issue i ve had with the game so far is minor bugs and glitches that will most likely be fixed soon other than that if you love mw and the older cod games this is for you
