fungal shifted smoke into strange fungus which caused fire to be infinitely self fueling i didn t realize what this meant until i saw that fire wouldn t go out then it started to spread within minutes the entire world was engulfed in rivers of fungal fire no one could have escaped from the flood of flaming fungi that flowed behind me all i could see and hear was fire i lost a 5 hour run and it was one of the best moments i ve had in a game 10 10 would get noita d again
