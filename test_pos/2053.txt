2022 actually quite enjoyablebought it thinking that me and my friends would return this game but surprisingly it was a great experience playing from the na server i have a ping range of about 40ms to 80ms occasionally spiking to over 200ms however it doesn t really effect the game play pros great graphics fluid combos satisfying abilities and possible parries cons have a limited play window before everything goes wrong you would usually want to play around 2pm to 9pm that is when the server belongs to the na players however the moment it does into 10pm all the cn monsters awake and your ping will spike hard i am not sure why they would prioritize the amount of players from a regions ping compared to the supposed region like if i m from na i should always have around 60ms not altered because some people from other regions want to play in my region it really doesn t make any sense like if cn players come to na they should always have over 200ms
