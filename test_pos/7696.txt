2023 this is probably the best pirate game ever made but i cannot recommend for anyone who dislikes forced multiplayer you will have to interact with other players and 90 of them will try their hardest to you over this is by design and isn t necessarily a bad thing if that s the kind of stuff you re into no honor among thieves i suppose safer seas was recently introduced but it does more harm than good for new players it ll be a trap that wastes your time for players who don t want to deal with randoms you lose access to a significant portion of midgame progression and some more recently added features like guilds and captained ships it would ve been much nicer to have safer seas be just a gold penalty and significantly more ai ship spawns as it stands now it seems more like a half hearted attempt to appeal to an unhappy part of the playerbase without actually understanding what they want and why they want it once i sailed the high seas with a couple friends we d encountered other players many times before usually resulting in an instant fight to the death which already irked me given that we ve lost significant amounts of time earned loot many times on occasion we would meet friendly or neutral pirates who were doing their own thing passing by uneventfully this time we came across a neutral crew who shared a bit of conversation with us things were casual until they noticed we flew a pride flag i m sure i don t have to elaborate on what happened after safer seas should be for players that don t want to have a 50 50 chance of losing an hours worth of loot because someone decided they were going to level reaper players that want to play the only real pirate game around without being randomly by other people these people don t hate ship combat or whatever they hate random people deciding their fun is over without having a say in the matter all of that being said sea of thieves is pretty fun playing with a few friends all getting on a ship and sailing around looting big vaults and digging up treasure going on a fun little adventure if you think you can deal with random pirate crews you up after a long labour intensive quest somtimes then i absolutely encourage giving this game a shot
