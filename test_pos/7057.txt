2017 pc specs gtx 1060 6gbi5 65008gb ramwith these specs i m able to run the game with a solid 100fps mostly maxed out however the quality did need some modifications for those with low specs you might have a hard time running this game while playing any of the zombies chronicles maps the game does crash sometimes for me and so far i ve found no solution to this this does not happen often but i ve experienced crashes while playing origins the most for those with lower specs you can avoid screen tearing if you have this problem by turning off subsurface scattering and order independent transparency after changing these settings you ll have a much better experience playing the game you ll have a major fps boost and the game should run smoothly without much of a quality difference as for the actual review bo3 is great if you only want it for zombies coming from someone who s grown up playing zombies the nostalgia hit so hard after playing the new remastered maps it s one of the best remasters i ve ever seen from a game therefore they did an excellent job bringing the experience back the multiplayer is also meh i do play it sometimes but people only play tdm the multi is mostly dead overall 7 10 for zombies bo3 is probably the best cod atm for it 8 remastered maps 9 if you include der riese from waw bo1 and bo2 also mod tools warning zombies chronicles does not come with the season pass if you wanted to buy the game just for zombies i suggest only getting zombies chronicles the season pass only has 4 maps and cannot be bought seperately
