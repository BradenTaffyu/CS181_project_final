2016 early access review pros runs smooth as silk either a loop gif effect or rendered live depending on the wallpaper does not interfere with desktop low resource usage if loop amazing you can get a bbc life loop 4k quality honestly this is unbelievable well donecons stops rather paused when an app is full screen or maximized big con can be changed in settings not able to adjust speeds some move too fast other too slow for me recent update allows this the loop is visible as it pauses for a milisecond before it restarts
