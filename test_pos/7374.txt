ok so after playing the game for 8 hours i m here to give my review i f seen alot pf complaints about mx which isnt true 1 they are dlc so can only be bought once 2 they are very easy to gain in game just by playing the game so everyone is jumping on the hate for the wrong reason the fps for me i locked on 50fps on 4k which is good enough for me playing with ray tracing on and shadows mid and i dont have a high end rig so far i only get a lower fps in the biggest city which plays between 40 50 which isnt too bad what i dont like is the 1 character only thing which is stupid and they realised they made a mistake and said they are working on now overall the game is beautiful and combat is really amazing i pre ordered this game and went through it even after all the hate and i dont regret it a little bit it s been a very long time since i had a game that got me excited to get home to play 9 10 for me would get a 10 if they fixed the single character issue and make it easy to restart the game
