2016 you think mad max middle earth shadow of mordor or maybe dying light was a grindfest wrong black ops iii multiplayer is the one but i cannot stop and i like it is there any reason why core mode is more popular than hardcore would be 9 10 fun if there would be at least 30 40 players in hardcore i also kinda like campaign probably only the gameplay part even if there is a story somewhere in it then it s easily forgettable one overall good ok meh not ok bad just why disclaimer actually i m not a cod fan and this is the only game i ve ever played from franchise so don t take my word for it
