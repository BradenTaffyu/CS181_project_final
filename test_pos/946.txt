2022 when i first purchased the game i absolutely hated it i was like whats the point of constantly dying there doesnt seem to be a point to the game besides dying i had it refunded then thought about the game so much that i had to give it another try because it seemed like i was missing something re purchased it started playing again questioned myself then somehow something clicked inside me i was slapped in the face and was mesmerized safe to say i now think this is an amazing game
