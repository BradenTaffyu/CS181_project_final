2017 this game is great there s a reason why it s one of the best selling games on earth there s really nothing else like this and anything that is like this will never live up to this a lot of people on steam are whiny entitled babies here s a few things i d like to debunk from playing this game for 500 hours 1 hackers are common ones are rare it happens if you don t enjoy it just switch sessions or play jobs i literally never see any hackers when i am out doing races deathmatches survivals etc they all frolic in free mode 2 anyone down here crying that they were banned for literally no reason saying i ground so hard for all that money is probably lying trying to get un banned for their stupid ass cheating i ve played this game for years and really the only way to get banned is dropping money for yourself others or getting so many reports that rockstar actually does something about it i have been friends with countless modders and hackers and they are pretty power drunk people most of the time if i m honest but sometimes they can make the session better if you re not a baby if you start telling modders to off and that you re reporting them they are going to ruin your fun if you don t like it that much find a new session easy as pause online find new session or easy as one two three 3 you can legitimately afford the stuff rockstar markets you want a luxor delux buy a hangar buy regular luxor paint it gold badda bing badda boom back in my days on ps3 i could probably make 200 grand a night grinding missions all you need to get started is to buy a bunker i say the bunker because you don t need to also buy a warehouse like the ceo offices normally people don t mess with gunrinning shipments 90 of the time they destroy your stuff it s just for the sake of destroying your stuff to piss you off because people are like that whenever you want to sell mass amounts of goods you re gonna need a few friends and there s plenty of guides on how to get a solo public session you can just invite your friends back to then sell your stuff before anyone joins 4 there s a lot to do in this game i find myself patrolling free mode basically allll the time and i have personally gotten bored doing it many people do this and then get mad that they can t go inside perticular buildings and do this and that and give it a review me and my friend were bored in free roam one time and i asked him if he wanted to play from versus missions and races and stuff so we went and tried it out and we actually had a lot of fun the rockstar created job lists are massive and there s even a creator to make your own stuff which i have utilized many a times over the years 5 you don t need to buy everything that isn t the goal to say there s an end goal to gta online would be like saying there s a specific end goal for everyone in life after you reach the max level 120 you just keep leveling i am like level probably 230 something now i have everything i could ever want in gta online however i find myself never using a lot of it some things are annoying to not have in gta online like a lot of guns ammo i have all the guns and tons of ammo for them all and i sort of feel very vaulnerable when i play on my alternate character which is only like level 70 back when he was level 20 it was hard fending off rocket spamming 3 kdr players that stat pat gta is just basically an open world crime game where the only objective is gaining a higher net worth 6 if you like cars it s a pretty good game open world you re not limited to sports race cars like some racing games if you like pickup trucks or suv s there s plenty of those for you to own you can own up to 120 some cars and you have the freedom to do with them as you wish be it racing drifting or wrap the son of around a tree you do you man but as a car enthusiast gta v is my favorite game the guns and the planes and the boats and everything else is just a huge bonus when i don t feel like doing car stuff 7 the developers are active they kind of have to be though so it s not a surprise but i find a lot of good games on steam develop very slowly and updates are few and far between but rockstar keeps it pretty up to date with new content although it would be nice to see that content in singleplayer like you guys used to cough and uh singleplayer god it s been years since i played the story but it s good that s what all the hype and all the love came from in the first place and we can t forget what a great game this was when it was released it was the benchmark for computer performance can i run gta v gta v budget pc builds this is really a classic game that i believe lived up and beyond it s predisessors and don t give me that oh but gta iv had better ai and better car damage and it was more realistic because yes gta iv did have some details left out from gta v but overall this really didn t ruin the game and probably wasn t even noticed by most people until that guy on youtube made that gta iv is better than gta v video which has 10 million views and people are making reaction videos to it but i can understand that they basically re made the game from scratch unlike the saints row transition from iii to iv if you re going to copy and paste a game i am going to be upset that you removed details but if you re make the game from scratch and it s bigger better i can ignore some missing details like how pedestrians stumble when they re pushed everyone is comparing their experince to value i don t care about the money if i enjoyed this if i randomly get banned i d buy it again honestly rockstar has a lot on their hands to turn heads with gta vi and honestly i expect a heatwave similar to call of duty advanced warfare upon it s trailer release because pc gamers are spoiled and hop on mob mentality band wagons like bad dragon products for example when they banished openiv there was an influx of over 40 000 negative reviews in like 3 days people just came to on gta v and rockstar because everyone else was doing it and it was cool if you ask me hackers make the game more fun in online you really just have to be creative before you leave a negative review think about if this is a game you d really enjoy in the first place because it s not just a shooter you wanna play gta v multiplayer with mods online get fivem it s great and probably exactly what you want
