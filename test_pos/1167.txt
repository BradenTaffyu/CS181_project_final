jaw dropping experience not the best combat out there you will die and i mean a lot elden ring is so rewarding so fulfilling you will have to go back and forth multiple times because you are probably under level but that s why this game is so unique and special i never thought i would like souls like games but exploring this open world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before it is truly remarkable every location you explore is incredibly built and designed with tons of secrets hidden places and doors multiple precious items and incredible views to see i truly think everyone should play this game atleast once in his life it is simply incredible something taken from fantasy books just have in mind that you re most of the times the victim you will have to farm exp kill a lot of mobs get good gear and upgrade it until you get stronger in order to go into new areas of the map search a lot online you will probably need it as zones have level caps but this game wont tell you anything literally anything but well i guess that s the beauty of it be patient do not rush enemies study their moves and patterns first then take your move and kill them dodge or parry exactly in the last second remember this is elden ring exploration is key if you cant beat an enemy do not worry come back later for 3 times i thought to myself i m not ever playing this again but i was wrong try it best love hate relationship there could ever be
