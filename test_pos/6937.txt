2017 do it for the zombies i literally only play this game for the zombies i play almost only on community created maps and they are just great i want to buy the dlc zombie maps but 50 is too hefty of a price for i think only 4 or 5 maps there is a new map pack coming for just zombies which i do plan on getting but that is so i do not have to keep playing the old maps on my ps3 and so i can do split creen on them yes i still play split screen zombies and it s great when your friend doesn t have a pc because some people just don t get it and he s one of them lol anyway i recommend this game for the zombies if you can find a deal elsewhere or if the game is on sale i really recommend it
