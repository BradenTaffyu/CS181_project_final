2022 i m having fun playing this game so i m recommending it but i think it needs a lot of qualifiers this game is not for everyone noita is hard extremely hard it makes hard roguelikes like ftl look like baby games many of the mechanics are very obtuse you will die and not understand how to improve at the same time this game is incredibly deep there are an incredible amount of mechanics mysteries and interactions to discover i find myself investing 45 minutes into a run dying to something throwing up my hands and yelling and rage quitting only to fire up the game 10 minutes later for another try that s not a fun experience for everyone but it s fun for some i d honestly recommend spending an hour or two trying to figure stuff out yourself and then checking some guides to understand exactly how much you re missing because for such a simple exterior there s a lot going on here
