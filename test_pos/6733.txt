2020 if you buy this game for anything other than zombies you re doing it wrong campaign isn t that good and multiplayer is completely dead i can t find a single game so your only real option here is zombies but i d say that makes up for everything else because black ops iii zombies is outstanding the map you get by default shadows of evil is amazing it has so much depth but even as a newer player you don t need to know how to do everything to have a fun time with the map if you want to spend some extra cash for the dlcs i m very confident that they re all worth it except for zetsubou no shima it s just a very tedious map and it s the worst one of the bunch however every other map is totally worth picking up definitely recommend this game to any zombies player who hasn t played it yet
