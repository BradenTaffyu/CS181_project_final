2017 i received the starter edition of r6 as a gift for my birthday last year and i never expected to end up with nearly 400 hours and climbing i ve never been too into more mainstream shooters so my obsession with this game came as a complete surprise make no mistake r6 still has an immense amount of bugs that can be frustrating to play through but when the game goes right it goes so right the highly destructible environments make for a constantly shifting and dynamic battleground and it s insanely satisfying to use it to your advantage on both attack and defense mira can cleverly neglect to reinforce specific walls and watch through her one way window gadget to go for surprise wallbangs on unsuspecting attackers ash can set a breaching charge on a random window barricade and then use her breaching round gadget to blow up another window and rush in while the defenders are still unsure of what approach the attackers are taking with the multiple disorienting explosions this brings us to the tactical shooter intel aspect of the game which is another big part of its appeal while sometimes iffy the sound in the game can often be just as valuable as the visuals you can hear the attackers running around on the roof or blowing up a wall or sending a drone in to gather intel and in turn plan your course of action whether it be rushing a busy attacker or simply feeding your teammates information so they can ready themselves for a push by the enemies on top of the incredibly fun and mostly skill based gameplay ubisoft does a surprisingly fantastic job of updating the game both for balance of existing content and addition of new content all non cosmetic additions operators and their weapon attachments can be unlocked pretty easily by just playing the game and earning renown to purchase them and all new maps are available to all players when they are added even most of the cosmetics with the exception of digital content bundles and some select headgears can be pretty easily unlocked with earned renown without ever forcing you to purchase the game s premium currency every few months there is a new season that adds two new unique operators a bunch of cosmetics and a brand new map in the middle of each season they push midseason reinforcements which are sets of balance changes and reworks based on operator usage statistics and community feedback tl dr the game really is despite its flaws an absolutely fantastic online shooter and i can t recommend enough that you pick it up and play it with a few friends rainbow six siege is easily a 9 10 game and the best online shooter to come out of the 2010s rivaling even the likes of cs go in its continued playability and competitive balance
