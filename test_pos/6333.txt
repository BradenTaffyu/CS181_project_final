2019 basically extreme hide and seek i love this game people will complain about some killers being too op or trolling survivors being trolls that all adds to the fun for me no games ever really the same because you don t know how each other player play which is bloody important it s a challenge as both killer and survivor and it kind of feels like two games for one which is nice
