2021 noita is my 2020 game of the year it s a rogue like fan s dream with 90 perks 330 spells 136 enemies procedurally generated maps and seemingly limitless wand variations that all keep every run feeling meaningfully different i almost always play warrior classes in fantasy games because magic just never feels as satisfyingly impactful as cracking enemies in the head with a giant hammer noita is the first game i ve played where magic truly feels like an absolutely devastatingly powerful force to be reckoned with that can easily kill the user if they cast the wrong spell at the wrong time spells in this game interact with each other in such an incredible meaningful way that it puts every other magic system in other games to shame i am just under 66 hours into this game have only found 203 of the 330 spells currently in the game and i still am finding new ways to combine spells for absurd and or op outcomes don t worry though you ll still find a way to fail your run even with the most op feeling wands i would consider myself generally good at video games and i have only won 2 of my 278 runs in this game that s roughly a 0 72 success rate my first win finally happened around the 50 hour mark this is a hard but extremely rewarding game according the the current achievement data only 11 5 of people who have played this game have beaten it and a winning run takes about an hour or less if the enemies don t kill you the environmental hazards will if the environmental hazards don t kill you your own poorly timed spell casts will it is unforgiving but entirely fair and every run feels meaningfully different even at the 66 hour mark i highly recommend playing it
