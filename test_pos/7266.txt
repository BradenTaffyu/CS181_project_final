tldr the game itself is great like ddda but better the only problem for me are the performance issues i will happily update my review if they get fixed because i love the game in and of itself updated 1st day impressions i have to say that the performance issues really are noticeable especially for someone who meets the recommended specs i wouldn t mind lower fps overall if it was stable unfortunately it s quite frequent for me to get fps drops in towns and the city i just kind of got used to it by now because otherwise i am enjoying the game immensely the game itself is incredibly good it really feels like a dragon s dogma game to me the vibes are here ddda is so incredibly important to me and this game really matches that feeling of nostalgia it s like i know this game you know it feels like home to me i love that the pawns never shut up i love that the merchants repeat the same line over and over again i love the gathering system being the same i love how the setting feels so familiar i love the combat and how more intuitive it feels now i love this game because i loved the first one and this is more of the same thing it feels like coming home if you love ddda you will love this one too as for the microtransactions i am definitely not a fan i honestly hate them i do but i wish people would fact check before posting negative reviews as you can get those items i think except the music dlc in game for free with minimal effort
