2020 dear annie i m sorry that i didn t write for such a long time i ve been busy how are you how s the weather in los santos do you remember how we met back in 2015 i ve just met franklin michael and trevor and spent way too much time with them my brother contacted me and asked me to join his online session that s when we two met each other i remember like it was yesterday you stood there looking like a junkie prostitute with strong similarities to the king of pop face wise i liked you from the first moment i liked everything about you your style your make up your eff you all attitude you were everything i never was i didn t see you for a long time then somehow a new character was there resembling the more real life me in los santos but i went back to you when i found you again in 2017 i just couldn t forget you you got a new haircut tried a few new hair colors new make up new clothes you even got a few tattoos i liked you even more i always wondered what you eat do you remember how often we checked out the restaurants in los santos we couldn t find one single open restaurant so i took you to a 24 7 store to buy a snack and some beers you often told me that you would love to try the food of burger shot cluckin bell or our favorite lucky plucker and you were sad for days when you found the closed restaurants again that broke my heart every single time and i wondered how you stay in shape i remember back in the 90s there were a few gyms around san andreas i can t believe they re all out of business now do you remember how often you told me that you felt so fooled because you only found a few actual stores how often did you stand in the streets watching the shop windows just to find the entrance closed you were happy to try new clothes in different stores but you complained that those stores all looked the same inside you felt strange when you couldn t enter most of the buildings you saw do you remember when you called me hysterically crying at 3am in the morning because you saw a guy spawning a tank out of nowhere we laughed so much about it when we moved away from those people we spent hours and hours just to look at everything you never understood why i was so fascinated by the fast food restaurants hell you even laughed at me for checking out all the trash in the streets you showed me all your favorite places in los santos and i truly loved them everything in your city is so damn beautiful the cars the landscapes the sea even the trash and the rain i often wished i had brought my own music with me since the current radio stations in los santos are so bad wow i still can t believe it i liked the ls rock radio and radio los santos but what happened to the stations playing metal there are too many boring radio stations but that s just my opinion the ls rock radio will still do for a while i guess do you remember the arena war times wow just wow that was fun do you remember our first visit in the casino we lost all the money lol and you wanted that 6 something million dollar apartment i could hardly hold you back from wasting even more money you have a few great modern apartments everywhere in the city i wonder if i can stay at one of your places again when i come for a visit again omg do you remember the strip club i hope they won t let people of young age in i mean who cares right there s still nobody checking the age of the people on the streets in ls haha do you remember how i got motion sickness when you let me drive once in car view i could go straight to bed right after that loved the realism of ls los santos could have been the best city ever unfortunately i don t like seeing you sad and lonely after a night out you always seem a bit depressed that none of the restaurants are open i hate seeing you like that girl i m glad that the landscapes calm you down a bit every time i think when more stores come to ls it will be the city to live in i would also see a variety of shops do you know what would be the ultimate thing in ls to have the possibility to buy furniture and decorations for those apartments and houses it would also be awesome to be able to change the wall colors and stuff like that hell i would move to you in a minute annie i hope to see you again soon stay safe and don t do stupid things please ls is a great place to live even when there are still some things missing all the best love your friend c
