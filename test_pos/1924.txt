good qualities compelling gameplay good progression not p2w can do most of the game solounfortunately the late game content is almost impossible to do without a team boss fights on hard or pro often throw way more enemies at you than you can handle alone prime wars require a huge amount of materials to complete most of which you ll have to grind for most of the late game will require grinding silos which are dungeons and bosses this can get very tedious very fast in addition it s very difficult to find teams to fight the much more difficult bosses they need to work on balancing these encounters better for solo vs teams fixing late game progression and working on the matchmaking system
