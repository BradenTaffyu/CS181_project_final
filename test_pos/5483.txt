2015 most fun i have had with a first person shooter in years pros solid tactical gameplay you really have to choose your entry points carefully classes are all fun and exciting to play each has its own important role microtransactions arent intrusive as in they only are for weapon skins and a boost of renown which is easy to get in the first place maps always feel like a different experience every single time cause of the way the objective moves around each round and so it feels like multiple maps in one cons the netcode right now is a bit wonky but ubisoft is addressing this issue some people are jerks and teamkill but doesnt happen that often in fact its only happened to me once in 30 hours of gameplay killcams are also jacked up and show someone killing you differently from what you saw the open mic issue is annoyingoverall i would give this game about an 8 10 and is definitly worth your time
