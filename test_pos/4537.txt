2019 warframe is a mediocre single player experience but a great multiplayer experience if you ve got a consistent cast of friends to play with for a free to play mmo the grind is manageable and the stuff you can buy is always stuff you could always just grind for there is no actual advantage to be gained by paying money except for saving yourself a bit of time and grind i believe literally the only thing that only real money can buy is some cosmetics and more storage space if you re the sort of pack rat like me who won t even throw away a bad or mediocre piece of equipment because what if and also because it would leave unsatisfactory holes in the collection gameplay wise warframe has come a long way from its humble beginnings and now you actually feel like a badass space ninja with even the simplest movement combos and combat actions the soundtrack is excellent the visuals are stunning and the game sees constant updates buffs and reworks to stuff that doesn t work or has ended up being underpowered constant introductions of new frames new gear new quests new areas etc if you haven t played for a year and then return you ll have to learn half the game anew because they are constantly upgrading and innovating warframe really has an extremely dedicated crew the storytelling is very love it or hate it the people i know myself included fall sharply into one camp that rolls their eyes and makes wanking gestures while suffering through the story parts and people who are breathlessly excited for the story parts i m in the latter camp i think they execute the story excellently the only complaints i could make about parts that require a bit too much grinding is levelling up the quills and vox solaris but even that s been largely dealt with by subsequent updates if you don t mind doing a bit of research to see what the most effective approach is
