2019 this game feels like it should ve been a aaa shooter made by some corporate conglomerate that charges you 120 for the base game and then 29 99 for each dlc they make every 3 months after but it s not and it s much more f2p then most f2p games only problem is the end game in the end game of racing games you re driving really really fast in really cool cars in the end game of fps you re shooting really cool guns and killing really powerful enemies in the endgame of a 3rd person space ninja grind shooter you re fishing and skateboarding and scanning items and playing dress up
