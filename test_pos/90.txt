product received for free i recently had the pleasure of playing black myth wukong and i must say that it is truly a masterpiece the game is a return to form for the action adventure genre with its fast paced combat intricate puzzles and beautiful open world i am grateful to the developers game science for bringing us such a high quality game one of the things that sets black myth wukong apart from other games is its commitment to its vision the game does not bend to the woke agenda as many other recent titles have in past years instead it stays true to its roots and delivers an experience that is both entertaining and thought provoking the performance of black myth wukong is also top notch even on an older system the game runs smoothly and looks stunning i was able to run the game on max settings with no issues which is a testament to the optimization work done by the developers i will easily put 1000 hours into this game the world of black myth wukong is so rich and detailed that i find myself lost in it for several hours at a time the combat is also incredibly satisfying with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from in conclusion black myth wukong is a must play for any fan of action adventure games it is a return to form for the genre and a shining example of what games can be when developers are allowed to focus on creating a great experience rather than pandering to a political agenda i highly recommend checking it out on steam 444
