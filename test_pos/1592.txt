this game is very good and the workshop full of mods for it makes the game x100 time better and it is crazy that the modders have added more free content since the games launch rather than the mulit million dollar company that runs this show the only thing i dislike is the amount of dlcs and how good units are locked behind them which is pretty annoying if you don t want to fork out hundreds of dollars on all these dlcs to unlock all the content of the game which btw some of these dlcs are a third of the price of the game itself but add not as much in comparison which is just blatant money gouging but overall good game bad business and greedy corporate decisions made by game higher ups
