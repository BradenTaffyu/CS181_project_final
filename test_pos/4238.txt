i first played this game back when it was on the xbox one 2013 and put in about 100 hours once my friends decided to move on i moved on as well the game was a fun way to burn some time with some friends there weren t many goals back then let alone much of a story i had some frames some weapons color palettes from holiday events never spent a dime on the game i decided to re download it early last year to my pc after getting curious as to how the game has changed and also to get some nostalgia from a game i played a lot in high school wow so much has changed i played through the new intro mission and was very surprised this game has fleshed out quests now i was super excited but the thought of grinding all over again for some frames felt daunting especially after how they changed which planets give which frame blueprints and they added so many more planets and missions compared to when i first played so i put it down and eventually uninstalled which brings us to january of this year i heard there was cross save added around the end of 2023 and decided to give it a shot when i set it up i made it so that i kept my pc accounts progress but also receiving all the items i had from xbox all i can say is wow i got what i had back and replayed the missions i was hooked this game is incredible the story the combat the world this really feels like a passion project and the art direction takes it to a new level every single item warframe and ability feel so incredibly unique in not only how they look but also how they play and are used in the game the combat is incredibly tight and responsive and that paired with the movement really makes you feel like some futuristic space ninja wizard the possibilities for builds are endless and even though the current state of the game has an end game meta everything is viable and usable the story is a slow burn and while it does take a long time to get into it is extremely worth it there were moments where i had goosebumps especially towards the end this definitely feels like some avant garde mix match of sci fi and fantasy and it blurs the lines so damn well i cannot stress that enough while the games core purpose is grinding to get upgrades new warframes weapons etc it still feels like as long as you have something building in your foundry you will always have something new to try next time you log in the micro transactions in this game there are three main ways to buy things in this game one with in game earned credits the second is a premium currency purchased with real money called platinum and the third is straight forward just buying items with money through steam almost everything can be earned in game save for most of the cosmetics but even getting the premium currency in the game is possible without spending any money there is an active trading community that uses the premium currency and it is surprisingly easy to get into there are 3rd party websites like warframe market that list buying orders and selling orders so it is easy to find someone that has what you need or needs what you have the premium currency can buy almost every item in the game using this method and can also be used to speed up the foundry when crafting an item the items that you buy straight through steam are usually user created items that warframe has for sale as cosmetics and it in part supports the creator i have spent my fair share of money on this game but the credit goes to the art department for making things look so good this game is great addictive fast fun interesting rewarding the grind won t be for everyone but every hour and future hour i have in this game is well spent 9 10
