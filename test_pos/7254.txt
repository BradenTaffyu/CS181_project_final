mostly i feel many of the critical reviews are whiny this is a fun game in its own right and if you liked dark arisen or similar games you ll enjoy this one too do not spend the extra money on the deluxe edition ever regardless of sales i played through twice to 100 the game and enjoyed my time doing so i waited a regrettably long time to try the thief vocation which is crazy fun to play and deadly powerful against large enemies especially those that are completely immune to magic in almost every form two things i ll address in case anyone still cares firstly the dlc is totally irrelevant and there is no need at all for anyone to spend additional money on it everything you can buy you will easily obtain in the game just by playing is it that the dlc even exists in the first place yes should you cry about it and not play the game because of it i guess that depends on how badly you need a deep cry but probably not secondly i can t argue with the mention of optimization issues but rarely did i feel it was so slow as to be unplayable that said i have an rtx 4070 and wasn t playing on max settings or anything and 30 45 fps wasn t uncommon and yes it was irritating and i could see for some that being immersion breaking but perhaps this is just me i never really believed i was anywhere doing anything other than sitting on my very non fiction ass playing a very fiction game in the first place so mildly irritated is all i was i still rode a griffin like it was my own personal escort to well not where i was hoping to be but here i am
