2023 so elden ring is my first souls like game that i have ever gotten 100 achievements and it was amazing this is the best game i have ever played and i loved every minute of playing it the story the world the characters i loved all of it i felt like a kid in a candyshop except the storeowner and everyone in the shop is trying to kill me as i keep dodging them trying to steal candy for myself giggling wildly to myself as i have gone mad from being touched by a giant burned and smoldering hand that only has three fingers but hey at least i get some awesome looking eyes so yeah i can t wait for the dlc to come out this game get s a golden 10 10 from me
