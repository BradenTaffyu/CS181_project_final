overall 8 10the game was super hyped when it came out and i was pretty hyped myself the dlc are totally useless it is just to be there i guess you can get the content of the dlc for 500 gold or find them pretty easy the map is not that large to have tons of waypoints the drama around it was unnecessary the only problem was the fps on towns oh god the game is pretty interesting and fun to play overall positive a lot of side things to do side quests tasks quests that gives you interesting items it is a nice way to make you explore and find things along your journey fighting is quite fun with a lot of classes and abilities and you can feel the difference between them the warrior is a bulky and slow huge damage dealer the archer must be away or it will be unable to shoot arrows those kind of feelings the only things is the limited equipped abilities changing classes so easily super fun you will not be bored the last vocation the wayfarer is insane it was super fun to play as achievements mean something and it was super fun to do 100 every achievements is attached to some part of the lore or things you should experience true ending is interesting with a good twist neutral for me it is negative but the game was super easy in terms of difficulty negative story is super short and not that amazing before the ending travelling gets boring getting to face all the same enemy all the time in the same place affinity is super annoying to manage and have affinity with people ferrystones are kind of expensive on the beginning and limited to buy 1 at each store each day or so fps around towns are so low hope they fix it final thoughts it is a pretty fun game drakes are cool d
