2019 this game broke my heart but i m still going to give it a thumbs up because it does deserve a chance there is nothing fundamentally broken about this game and it can be a blast to play however be warned that in the end it is not what it seemed to be when you started playing there are great reviews from people way more skilled and knowledgeable than me so i m not going to cover the basics as they have been already explained way better in said other reviews instead i ll talk a bit about why i have stopped playing this game 1 this game does not understand fun grinding i know that this matter is highly subjective but i still think that the system warframe chose to apply is the biggest chore possible instead of grinding for materials or loot with the weapons and frames you like you grind the same stuff with equipment you despise again and again this is because you have to do so to increase your mastery level to obtain more gear you cannot get more mastery level with gear that you have leveled up already in other words with gear that you obviously like to use and it takes forever to level that gear up unless you go for the most efficient way possible and grind one boring level over and over and over again and it still takes hours to get one horrible weapon or frame to level 30 i stopped playing when i noticed that i had spent more time playing with frames and weapons that i hate rather than the ones i enjoyed to play with 2 you need to be in a clan guild to access half of the equipment in this game i d like to join a clan i have made friends with or a clan that i know people from maybe even create my own clan but you cannot do anything in this game without a clan not even trade you have to join a clan immediately you end up joining a massive clan and never play with the members because they already have their farming times and buddies or a dying clan that suddenly vanishes without a trace and you need to find another one repeat over and over again 3 i don t like how the story turned out i have played this game since 2013 and it has gone through some major changes during this time most of them were great and added a lot to the game but the story destroyed the world of warframe in my opinion it is not really that great even though it has been praised by many at least in my opinion maybe i just had hoped for more the story is not completely flawed by any means but i remember the times when this game was a mystery when the level design and the frames told a story when i looked out to the space and stayed there for 15 minutes wondering where i was when me and my friends spent 3 hours in a single orokin void mission just admiring the architecture trying to figure out what happened why were there puzzle rooms who made them what were the capsules filled with odd substance or negative looking space why was all this abandoned it truly was a blast and it evoked the feeling that i often look for in games the one you feel when you find something really surreal and for a moment question everything this game was the perfect environment for your own story and i think it really suited this game a boring loot shooter does not need a boring story at least let me have some freedom this review really ended up longer than i was hoping for if you made it here thanks for reading and if you haven t tried the game go for it you might like it
