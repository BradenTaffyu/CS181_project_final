quite possibly the best way to play zombies in the cod series not only do you have some excellent maps zombies chronicles along with progression for guns and prestige levels to grind for but also custom zombies content via the steam workshop if you re looking to play this game safely be sure to search up t7 patch by shiversoftdev and look up any videos at how to setup the patch and you re done the game also suffers from performance issues after an update to the steam api and t7 patch fixes that issue no problem in addition to you can uninstall the campaign via the manage dlc section of the game to save up on file size game is huge fair warning black ops 1 and black ops 2 are still good games for zombies but this game has so much content that it is in my opinion the definitive cod zombies experience buy this on sale though it still baffles me and many others that they sell this game still for 60 or even 100 dollars definitely wait for a sale and get the zombies deluxe edition if you want all maps and do the super easter egg the game has to offer or if you want just base game and zombies chronicles you can pick up just the zombies chronicles edition and play the many custom maps to your hearts content
