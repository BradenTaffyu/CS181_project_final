2022 total war warhammer 3 is the latest game in the grand strategy franchise where the player will command armies containing thousands of soldiers in real time battles while also managing their empire on the turn based world map this is the 7th total war game i ve played following both previous warhammers shogun 2 rome 2 three kingdoms and troy while i enjoy the real world historical games the warhammer games are my favourites because of the variety provided by the different races which helps to keep lengthy campaigns interesting immortal empiresi m basing this review on the immortal empires campaign where the maps from all three warhammer games have been combined into one giant world map featuring every faction who has appeared in the franchise most of my time has been spent playing as the grand cathay faction led by zhao ming the scale of this campaign is incredible i ve eliminated a faction of cathay rebels skaven dark elves ogres nurgle chaos and two factions of vampires who all thought it was a good idea to declare war on me plus a couple of beastmen armies who were raiding in my territory i ve got alliances with three neighbouring cathay factions one is defending the great bastion which reminds me of the wall in game of thrones from chaos armies to the north while the other two have expanded south through lands previously held by lizardmen they ve helped to keep my borders mostly secure allowing me to focus on fighting all these wars between us we now own 65 settlements i ve earned the short victory and if i confederated my allies i d be close to the long victory its taken 45 hours and 138 turns to reach this point often fighting multiple battles per turn and there are still 91 other factions on the map on my western border high elves are fighting more skaven while some greenskins have attempted to invade my empire twice i ve also had to defend my north western border against multiple attacks by another chaos faction led by archaon the everchosen the final boss of the first game meanwhile in lands so far to the west that i can t even imagine how long it would take me to get there are large empires belonging to the tomb kings dwarves wood elves slaanesh and the empire all hail mighty grand cathay a screenshot of total war warhammer iii by g00n3r varied factionscathay s playing style feels like a typical total war campaign where i m capturing settlements constructing buildings to upgrade my economy and fund more armies to further extend my empire their armies have a good all round mixture of melee ranged and cavalry units but they also have some unique features they can send trade caravans to the capital cities of friendly western empires to earn big profits but enemy armies especially ogres in the mountains can attack the caravans during their journey they have to pay attention to harmony where most buildings generals research and events favour either yin or yang when they re balanced you get bonuses to income growth and control public order but when yin yang are unbalanced you start to get penalties and every few turns you can choose which direction to set the wu xing compass which controls the winds of magic this is almost entirely a positive thing which lets you get bonuses depending on what you re planning to do over the next few turns reduce recruitment cost if you want to raise a new army increase replenishment when you re fighting lots of battles increase income if your economy is struggling increase control to avoid rebellions or reduce corruption when you re capturing territory that has been held by vampires or chaos factions such as nurgle i ve also spent around 10 hours playing as skarbrand s exiles of khorne whose tactics feel very different to be honest i m not sure i fully understand how to play them but i m starting to have some success their armies lack ranged units and are focused on strong melee and cavalry but the biggest difference is how their economy works they don t earn much money from buildings and their units are very expensive to recruit so it feels like capturing territory is a waste of time because i d never be able to support enough armies to defend a large empire instead i think the correct tactic is to have a couple of armies quickly rampaging around the map from one settlement to the next sacking to earn enough money to pay upkeep and razing to either earn skulls needed to research new tech or spawn medium size temporary armies for free who automatically disband after a few turns but give you a short term boost to military strength so while cathay is about building and expanding khorne is focused on destruction which feels appropriate for a faction belonging to the blood god and this illustrates how the different factions don t just have units that look unique they offer very varied playing experiences which provides a lot of replay potential technicalso far the game has crashed 3 times but i suppose that s actually pretty good for 60 hours of playing time in a campaign that is still labelled as a beta i haven t noticed any other bugs and i ve had no problems with framerate even though there are hundreds of factions armies and settlements on the map the end turn process moves quite fast the visual design and animations for all the different units is really good and i like how the appearance of the world map changes based on its level of corruption from green grass and trees to a scorched wasteland recommendationwarhammer 3 is an excellent game that veteran total war players will most likely enjoy the scale of the immortal empires campaign is easily worth a full price purchase assuming you already own the previous warhammer games as reaction to this game s story campaign which i haven t tried yet was quite negative new players would probably have more fun by starting with warhammer 1 and 2 which both have strong story campaigns
