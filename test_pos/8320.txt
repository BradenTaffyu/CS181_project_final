2022 at just under 100 hours and over 250 runs i finally beat this game last night by every rule of game design i should despise it the game hates you every pixel which you can use to your advantage can be used against you every cool wand you build can probably kill you as well i m sure that the devs were sitting in their chairs cackling as they added yet another niche mechanic that no one would ever discover or another enemy to one shot you at the wrong place and time or cool looking item that kills you with just a little wrong use and yet i love this game it s addictive the wand building is godly and the physics adds an extraordinary depth there are just so many mechanics to explore exploit and get killed by make sure you have the wiki open though
