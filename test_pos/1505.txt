2022 the state the game is currently in is wonky i don t understand how the team that built this game didn t just build from warhammer 2 i have hundreds of hours in that game but something just feels off with this game and its not the trash ass campaign designed by the same dude who designed vortex and clearly doesn t take any criticism
