not far into the game but i am having blast story is throwing me for a loop but in a good way graphics are nice too spent hours in character creation and i mean hours which that doesn t bother me as i enjoy creating characters which brings me to one of my downsides one slave slot not a fan but that is okay fall damage is challenging as well much more brutal than it was in the first other than that the game seems like its going to be great for those that enjoy games with character creation a good story and exploration would highly recommend
