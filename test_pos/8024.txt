2021 i m michael i play great games really poorly twitch tv noita is a game of surprising depth it s dev team nolla games undersell the game as a simple showcase for the game engine they have developed a pixel based physics game in which every pixel is physically simulated my own initial interest in the game was as something that i d anticipated to be a kind of pixel playground with a side interest in magic spells i was very wrong playing noita is a joyous punishment with each comical death you learn hard lessons you are told no rules but given tools and the facilities to learn how to use them on first presentation the game which looks like a funky terraria clone reveals itself to be more of a roguelite with a little dungeoneering thrown in for good measure it s only once you ve died around a hundred times before you re awakened to some of the scale of how wrong you were intitially the procedurally generated levels are new with every rebirth but you come to learn the patterns of the landscape you come to identify the mechanics of the increasingly obnoxious mobs and the quirks of specific spells in combination with each other all of a sudden you re beginning to see that this simple physics based roguelite game is actually a comprehensively punishing game based on precision intricate knowledge of the game mechanics and unflinching desire for more more gold more spells more wands more power after 282 hours i have beaten the game twice i have died upwards of 500 times i refuse to play the game any longer it showed me a side of myself which scared me i had become a man obsessed with discovering the secrets hidden within secrets which nolla games have painstakingly laced into the very fabric of this magical action roguelite i can only give this game the highest of praises it showed me the flaws within myself i was left humbled and defeated by it
