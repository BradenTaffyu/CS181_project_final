2019 there s no way i ll be able to put into exact words how great noita is for me as it s just too spectacular to express over the internet but i ll try my very best i ve promised myself that i ll only write this review once i completed the game and after 90 hrs of hard work and dumb luck i ve finally done it noita is a pixel based rogue lite game and as a fan of similar games such as danball s physics simulation game enter the gungeon there ll be a slight bias in my review like saying how this game is a huge plus in my book the amount of different runs you can have is endless as the maps the enemies the perks the wands and even its corresponding spells are all randomly generated every round so the replayability of this game is insanely high almost infinite so you ll never find yourself bored i really appreciate every single detail of noita as every particle can mean a difference between life and death as there s alot of pixels that can kill you fire electricity acid lava poison and freezing vapour liquid so you ll be on your toes at every single second as the world around you changes that s another thing that i like about the game is that the world feels alive and you feel small knowing the world doesn t only revolve around you and there could be events happening around the map without your knowledge there was once an enemy got their hands on a wand that uses nukes and you could imagine my surprise when i jumped into a half destroyed map and even in the holy mountain you teleport to after you reached the end of the level can have threats such as the angry gods worms tunneling to your very spot or teleporting enemies you are never safe unless you press esc haha about the environment i really appreciate the randomly generated areas that could spawn in the map such as large containers containing helpful dangerous liquids bars cranes traps snowmans and structures that contain treasure in em so i hope future updates will see more of them i especially love the broken pipes in the frozen depths that emits flammable gas it really adds to the environment i also enjoy the background models as they do not obstruct your path but react to the environment around them such as ladders or plants that burns melts and explodes it really adds more to the experience and pleases me to no end the environment is also handy in turning the game around especially in the frozen depths where the enemies are killer more about that in the next para but with the abundance of ice growing around the map you are able to make use of them to crush the enemy with ease as they are very vulnerable to the environment so use that to your advantage to address the difficulty barrier of this game especially from the third level and onwards i think it is fine the way it is the hard part usually involve runs where all the odds are against you but as i play more and more i start to find the later levels manageable as you gradually come to adapt to the difficulty and figure out strategies to beat it without having powerful wands like using the environment to your advantage making use of bombs to fend off the enemies or perks such as glass cannon to aid you though for casual players this may be a hindrance to their gameplay so i suggest adding a mod that either reduce the hp or dmg of enemies so as to improve their experience and maybe a sandbox where they can play around with spells as this game could use a larger community i do understand that there are those who like to play games leisurely so i think this would be a good addition to the game to appeal to more folks but those who say deaths feel unfair probably has not played it long enough to understand the game mechanics and use it to their advantage and hence will suffer more than those who played it for longer as every death is a learning experience and you ll improve by avoiding past mistakes i also think the despawn time of the gold as good as it is as it makes the players decide whether they should risk their live to get the gold or not so it adds to the thrill plus every little detail of this game is amazing and to show you how great it is i ll list a few of my favourites ability to kick individual particles not a major thing but i like this little attention to detail enemies being able to pick up wands and use it against you faction kind of system in game as enemies are also hostile to each other such as the hatred towards rats by every enemy background models reacting to the environment through burning melting and exploding particles can react together to form compounds such as when lava and water mix with each other or health antidotes through the right concoction smart ai they can always find a way to get to you even if you re trying to hide huge map with different environments from frozen depths to the desert easter eggs around the maps scrolls and structures you can find off the regular map items and bodies sink into ice and coal this could make for some dumb deaths as they can hide bombs too and now to the only flaw of the game individuals pixels should have a weight to it so when it does not exceed the limit like 5 pixels then it ll fall as many small pixels around the map after explosions or water reacting with lava can be unsightly and hinder combat as they can deflect your shots and kill you just because you didn t notice that one tiny pixel there but that s not too say i don t like pixels it s just take it has to be taken down a notch and exclude pixels which are invisible to the naked eye and really disrupt combat all in all noita is a great game and i highly recommend you to get it at full price as it ll only get better in the future thanks to the undying support and love from the developers of nolla games keep up the good work tldr great game that s well deserving of its price major replayability so you ll get your money s worth
