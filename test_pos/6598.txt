really hyped loving everything i ve seen edit after 10 hours is a mix of warframe and destiny yes it is not amazing but it is also not horrible it s repetitive but decent and if the right choices get made it has potential to become a very good game even if you re a die hard destiny fan and think you hate this game you should still give it a try
