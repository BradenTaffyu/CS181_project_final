2016 are you ready to siege the day here s my short and honest review about this game good things 5 vs 5 very comptetive so take your chances to esl it has an esl tournament requires teamplay teamwork it s an optimized game since it was a ubisoft product i really didn t expect it to be this good and i have to say it wasn t this much optimized when it was released most of the problems and glitches were from amd users now the game is better and more enjoyable the graphics are good not awesome though we really don t need this much graphic quality in the fps games because the players should focus on getting more frame rate for some reasons instead of having everything on ultra like aa vsync etc tactical game you can actually have defense offense plans and train with your team clan for the gamers who do want to play a tactical game these are some unique features not for those who prefer run n gun if you have about a 10 operator you can actually choose what you want since every operator has its main wep and abilites to defend attack choosing your main and learning with him her whould be the best idea you can t jump yeah it s very good no more bunny sh t now you can vault from the desks and everything else it s comptetive so take your chance to esl this game have esl tournament bad things uplay ha please netcode hit registration they just said that they will try to fix it i hope they do you can t spectate your friends during the game the ranking system is not good now it will change with any matchmaking sometimes it takes years to find a game with 4 5 cheaters it s obvious you can see that in every fps game anti cheat system s normal it s was worse when the game was launched known fact you can see more cheaters in the games with high competitive potential the features which you can fell free to list as pros or cons it s not grind but micro transaction you know pay 50 40 for aaa game and you still gotta pay more for some other things skins it s neither good or bad season pass is kind of useless 5 renown booster 7 day early access to new operator and for 30 20 come on give me a break this part is good for those who want to know about the community in this game community ubisoft has a good kick ban system of teamkillers normally in casual games people don t use voice messages but in ranked people try to use that chat rage is normal in ranked is normal too rating 7 10 note it s very hard for me to recommend this game it s like playing on edge of a sharp blade but guys be paitent it will be fixed and become a very good game i m looking forward to the future of this game it ll be huge comptetive and cool end it s my first review since the deleted ones
