i ve never seen something so book accurate without being book accurate as someone who grew up loving pinocchio with it still holding such a special place in my heart this game is especially an absolute dream to anyone who knows the book even down to the tiniest detail of things like lampwick s real name being romeo mentioned only once in the book a disease that slowly effects and changes one s body the cat being going blind also only mentioned once in the book and a green monster that tries to eat pinocchio this is a giant beautiful love letter to pinocchio please give it a go if you ve never read the book maybe read it after or before the game if you really want to see just how much love went into this game
