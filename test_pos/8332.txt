2019 early access review note i made this review during early access so this may be subjected to change in the future you like those falling sand flash games you like roguelites do you like those two things slammed together with a hint of wizardry if so noita is probably the thing for you though still in early access it s surprising how much stuff there is in this game already while at the same time holding allot of potential for all kinds of new things too the main selling point of every pixel is simulated is what you would expect thing s burn freeze melt or react with stuff to create a domino effect of events to destroy the world around you some small key features such as the dynamic music sounds also make the world burst with life in some places the soundtrack has a trippy magic feel that you would expect in a game centred around wizardry or magic stuff every wand is not only randomised for each new world generation but can be highly customised with new spells to create either a powerful weapon or a horrible abomination that can even kill you one feature that i love from the rest is the game s world itself though you got the underground itself which is the main area of the game that holds not only many unique areas that contain their own themed enemies but also holds many small sub areas that hold their own style too if you are as curious as i am you d attempt to use the newly learned abilities with certain wands to dig your way out of the game s mountain and either go left or right both have their own unique areas filled with all kinds of secrets for you to find noita essentially creates an entire world for you to explore and piece together my only issue which is probably just my personal opinion is that there is too much open space and not many things to find besides a pyramid on the right and a wickerman on the left it would be nice to see things occur on the world around you like a small castle or a graveyard though that doesn t ruin my experience with how the game is played already not only does it have a good amount of replayability but a good challenge to go along with it with that being said i feel like this game won t be for everyone there are some that may not really enjoy game s like these or just don t like the difficulty and that s totally fine though i hope that doesn t discourage you from giving this game a try to put it shortly noita is great and though it has allot of stuff already for you to enjoy it also has allot of potential for future content though still in early access and may need some polishing around the edges the game is still enjoyable none the less tl dr noita in early access alone is surprisingly enjoyable and decently big though rough around the edges which is expected for an early access game
