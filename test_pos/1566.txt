2023 i bought the game on sale definitely not worth the full price the dlc price is outrageous i like the game despite it s flaws it has the worst ai in almost any game i have ever played armies running back and forth between their own settlements for 50 turns enemies ignoring 10 other factions they are at war with to attack you allies that do nothing except try and drag you into every war possible now neck and neck with paradox with the most disgusting dlc policy in gaming need to take a good hard look at baldurs gate 3 on delivering excellent complete games instead of focusing on greed
