sensational experienceblack myth wukong was released under a lot of anticipation after gameplay showcases had been shown over the past few years leading people to even question if the game would really come out like that thankfully it really did and overcame all expectations the game is engaging well made fluid has a fair dose of difficulty is downright beautiful and is worth every penny and time you put into it story backgroundi honestly find it hard to catch up with the story at least without any knowledge on the classical chinese novel the journey to the west where the developers have taken inspiration from still that doesn t mean you can t enjoy the game especially during a second playthrough the game isn t the classical novel itself but inspired by it it s set after sun wukong s disappearance death after his fight against the celestial court event that serves as a prologue you play as a monkey warrior referred to as the destined one who journeys through the land to recover sun wukong s six relics which were scattered across the land in order to try to bring the famous monkey back to life how does it feel it feels amazing black myth wukong is a third person game that you can label under the soulslike banner however that doesn t mean it has an excruciating difficulty it s more of a friendly soulslike with some elements of hack and slash enemies are usually difficult bosses are challenging but you won t lose anything if you die it might take you some time to beat some bosses but you eventually end up succeeding the more you venture into the game the better you get because you are earned more resources to fight as well as you get naturally better at playing it there practically aren t hordes of enemies like in a hack and slash game so you won t be swarmed a magical iron staff is your main weapon but there are also magical skills transformations three difference stances potions to temporarily enhance your abilities and a skill tree to spend your points on according to your playstyle there won t be enough points sparks to buy all abilities so be wise and understand what your playstyle is and don t waste sparks on things you don t use although it s possible to reattribute them among the things that make this game appealing is the fluid combat it s not sluggish floaty and clunky as most soulslike games the movements are beautiful and fast paced satisfying to perform and the bosses hardly ever have the same movements they are pretty much all unique which adds to the game so you don t feel you are facing a repetition of a previous boss under new skin except for the elemental frogs graphics and details are no jokeblack myth wukong is a new generation game like no other it features the best and most advanced technologies out there and applies them very well it s not a poorly optimized game it indeed is a heavy one but even if you lower the presets you are still going to have a beautiful game the game doesn t survive on good graphics alone i could say it s absolutely one of the most beautiful games i ve ever played the details in the scenarios the architecture the clothes the weapons with all the rich chinese ornamentations how well detailed the enemies are when it comes to appearance movements attacks how varied everything is you can spend a lot of time just gazing at details which contributes a lot to your immersion well i could spend all day long listing how incredible the details are game science didn t have any laziness flawsof course there are flaws the game is so incredible to the point that the flaws aren t a deal breaker but they re so silly they shouldn t be there the most alarming of all are the invisible walls wukong is full of them even at unnecessary places we re not talking about a totally linear game there are areas of semi open world it means there shouldn t be invisible walls even inside monk temples where you could walk to the temple wall but you can t because there s another invisible wall before it when it happens it breaks the immersion a little bit another grave one is the simply terrible lip sync that disturbs our enjoyment a lot if we pay attention to it rather than notice other graphical elements that s why i stopped looking at their mouths and began admiring the rest they haven t used any ai to lip sync with english so the english voiceover doesn t match the chinese lip movements embarrassing also some lighting issues sometimes occur when you walk into a new area for instance you may experience light sources changing just popping from dark to clear sunlight all of a sudden like inside some caves or other places in the desert i ve also experienced enemies npcs and other elements popping in front of me in the scenarios less frequently though maybe it could have been due to hours of session straight at least three or four times i was forced to close the game and rerun it after some lags and huge fps drops also after long hours of gameplay straight you see i got 32gb ram but maybe the game uses it so much that the memories are unable to erase unnecessary information but rerunning the game always fixed it black myth wukong is a mustit s not any game that has some flaws yet its strengths eclipse them the flaws don t ruin your experience and you definitely should play this game wukong is one of those games you can t miss and will make you have an unforgettable experience black myth wukong is not groundbreaking it doesn t reinvent the wheel but proves that if devs really want to create a game with competence and passion and above all a game that is supposed to be what it is a videogame they deliver wonderful experiences the price tag is fair for such a masterpiece you don t need to wait for sales grab it
