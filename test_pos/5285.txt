2018 simply a great game it is much more enjoyable than other competitive shooters in the market i stopped playing cs go because it got dull and was filled with cheaters i went to overwatch i stopped playing overwatch because it got dull and meta was extremely stale i went to siege i am pretty sure that i will stop playing siege at one point and go to another game however for now this game is awesome amazing pace not too fast not too slow gun fights can end in just a few seconds or be slow and methodical great variety of operators to play and choose from each with an own unique trait ability the list can go on but these are the two things i really enjoy about siege one of my main concerns is the netcode and how sometimes connection is just very subpar but i guess this is a norm for ubi games overall i recommend this game and i can t fault it as much as the other titles mentioned
