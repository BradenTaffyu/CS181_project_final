honestly this is already the front runner for game of the year do yourself a favor and jump in blind you won t regret it it s one the best games i ve ever played in the genre dragon s dogma 1 fans will be ecstatic newcomers will be equally happy with the experience do yourself a favor and buy a game that s worth the price buy dragon s dogma 2 none of the microtransactions are needed and honestly they re a total waste to buy there is so much to this game already and everything can be found in game i m so heartbroken at the moment because behind the curtains is one of the best games ever then capcom decided to do this crap with microtransactions they re trying to do their best impersonation of ubisoft
