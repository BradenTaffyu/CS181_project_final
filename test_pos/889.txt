2023 being my first souls game i was convinced i would be wasting my money and that the first boss i encountered would kick my ass and i was proven right in no time by the grafted scion but you were expected to be defeated by that one you say worry not the tree sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once i had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss the game is fantastic it got more and more rewarding as i progressed and i was happy to beat the game a second and a third time finding out new secrets during each playthrough there s no compliment i can come up with that hasn t already been used to describe this game there are so many weapons with so many different builds to try bosses can be frustrating but there s so much fun to be had even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights looking at you malenia is incredibly fair and fun and the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse i ve ever ridden in any game ever if i had anything to complain about are the platforming sections but after looking it up a bit apparently fromsoftware never really knew how to do those and they are so few and far between that s hardly a reason not to buy the game i could also complain that i was unable to romance boggart or blaidd they re so cool 10 10 the dlc cannot come a day too soon
