2022 if you are thinking hey this game still cost full price after almost 1 year consider that they released a finished game no particular blockin bugs can be played solo or coop and also pvp has a lot of replayability hundreds of hours of gamplay no microtransactions lot of modsand name any other game achieving 3 of these results in 2022 the value you obtain for the full price is huge and it will still be for another couple of years that being said the main downside i ve found after my first run of the game is that we are also paying the price of some qol updates added from the dark souls saga namely 2 spirit ashes and golden effigy now we can almost matchmake to find a game to join or to find coop partners and we have upgradable npcs that can be summoned during boss fights as opposite of ds you don t need quests or requirements to have them so basically you can get free help in any boss fight these things sounds very cool and they are when you are roaming the open world and fighting flying dragons as a melee fighter but especially in the last segment of the game the boss fights are clearly designed around these helpers and making them full solo doesn t require a git gud ds attitude but a git godlike one and as someone who has beaten most of ds3 bosses in solo i m fiding this a bit disappoiting especially with extremely punishing bosses like the fire giant
