2023 the game is pretty good the stories are engaging and it is fun to play with your friend except if you play solo it s hell however if you like challenges playing solo might be great for you the gameplay is repetitive and boring but if you want to collect some money and be a fashionista in the pirate world the grind is worth doing or you could leave the fashion world and be a reaper to ruin other people s day it s great too the pvp gameplay is fun it could be ez 5 mins fight or it could be 1 hour battle of attrition yes i ve experienced 1 hour battle but the tension and the action is real and pump your adrenaline the ironic part about this game is this is a pirate game but you can t pirate this game kekw
