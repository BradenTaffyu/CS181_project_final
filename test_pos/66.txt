the game is a solid 10 10 for me personally otherwise i wouldn t have finished it 5 times and done all the achievements there isn t anything in the game that i haven t enjoyed graphics story combat the chinese setting everything clicked with me and i had real fun every singular minute spent in the game the only thing the game could have improved is letting players enjoy all the equipment earlier in the game and the fact that there is no enough resources to upgrade everything you want in a single playthrough is a little bit frustrating you get so many cool things so late in the game you simply do not have enough time playing with them i guess they had more chapters planned but they couldn t implement everything they had in mind
