i played the beta like a month ago and was totally blown away i could care less about another battle royale game but the deathmatch mode is some of the most addicting and fun gameplay i have ever experienced the game is so fast and fluid with your movement you get a grappling hook which makes any game immediately appealing to me and you have a good variety of weapons the game needs balancing but those are easy fixes and when the full game releases i will not care what price it is but i somehow expect it to be free to play play the next beta coming in june if you can absolutely worth your time
