2023 arise now ye tarnished ye dead who yet live the call of long lost grace speaks to us all elden ring is the best selling fromsoftware game the 2022 goty and one of my favorite games of all time many think that elden ring is merely dark souls with an open world twist but trust me it transcends that simplistic comparison note this review is entirely spoiler free any potential spoilers will be concealed in black boxes so feel free to read without concerns about plot reveals the first stepelden ring s character creation stands out as the best among all the previous souls games developed by fromsoftware the face visuals are more detailed and there are additional customization features the effort put into character creation really paid off providing players with more opportunities to craft unique and distinct characters the opening cinematic in elden ring a tradition in souls games left a strong impression on me the art style quality and voice acting exceeded my expectations making it one of the best introductions in video games for those new to this gaming style elden ring may be challenging initially while i having played many souls games didn t encounter such issues my advice is to be patient the game s difficulty is fair if a boss feels unbeatable early on it means you re not prepared explore more level up get better gear soon the game becomes more manageable surprisingly elden ring felt the easiest among the souls games i ve played from fromsoftware at least until malenia kicked my ass for 7 hours straight before i beat her the lands betweensome folks argue that mixing an open world style with the souls formula messed up elden ring here s my take it s a bit of both having a huge map is cool but it s tough for devs because they can t just copy paste empty areas so they filled it with stuff like ruins and caves the downside some bosses start feeling a bit repetitive i get it s hard to make a big map and balance it with creativity at the same time but meeting the same mini boss a bunch of times got a tad boring even though i got used to it on the positive side the open world showcases stunning landscapes with distinct vibes in each region the immersive atmosphere especially at night is captivating elden ring s design featuring captivating night skies and distant beautifully crafted structures prompted me to capture numerous screenshots an aspect i genuinely adore however the open world setup also poses challenges with quests side quests are easy to miss especially for those playing blind elden ring s vastness means npcs can be overlooked without exploring thoroughly while some give hints it s not foolproof not everyone may value these side stories but they play a significant role in the game as i ll elaborate on in the next section the caves and catacombs scattered throughout the vast lands offer an enjoyable exploration experience enriched with puzzles and mazes i relished navigating through each one and the inclusion of a cooperative element by summoning a friend to explore together adds another layer of fun to the exploration process i was able to live as my own person side quests in elden ring are essential for me adding significant depth to the overall experience without them the game would be less enjoyable while some may not prioritize side quests i encourage giving them a chance personally when i invest in a game i want to explore all aspects delving into npc stories enhances the game s coherence as these side quests are intertwined with the main lore skipping them means missing a deeper understanding of the story while you can watch them on youtube experiencing them firsthand is incomparable the uniqueness of each npc s story in the side quests was something special in elden ring going through them step by step and keeping track of each character s journey proved to be incredibly rewarding emotionally these side quests had a significant impact on me and i strongly advise against ignoring them if you decide to play the game i know it s tough to keep track of all of them but i managed by using word and doing some google research i did get spoiled at times but for me it was better than missing out on these rich and engaging stories altogether the fallen leaves tell a story elden ring s lore is truly beautiful and well worth delving into the game is undeniably complex especially for newcomers like myself however once you start paying attention to item descriptions and npcs dialogues connecting the dots the story unfolds into a masterpiece that s unique in every way initially i chose to remain ignorant avoiding youtube videos and online articles to steer clear of spoilers still i eventually had to seek out essential lore to grasp the basics without ruining the experience i stumbled upon a spoiler free reddit post explaining the fundamental lore aiding my understanding of the game despite this help my first playthrough left me perpetually confused a familiar feeling i ve grown to love from previous souls games after completing the game i turned to vaatividya s youtube videos the souls lore guy for a deeper perspective this transformed my view prompting a second playthrough on the same save file now i appreciate the interconnected details as an example even the design and symbols on the enemies armor carry meaning i have never known defeat bosses are undeniably crucial in souls games determining the overall quality of the experience while i acknowledged earlier that the game has repetitive mini bosses scattered throughout the vast lands the main bosses are a different story each is uniquely crafted presenting a special and distinct challenge not all of them posed significant difficulty for me except for two late game bosses but i genuinely enjoyed every fight regardless of the level of challenge however my disappointment lies in the lack of memorable soundtracks during boss fights a departure from the impactful music in previous souls games despite logging 178 hours for now i struggle to recall a single boss theme even for the main encounters the final boss fight is an exception elden ring fell short of my expectations regarding the musical accompaniment to these pivotal moments lay out your arms let s get smithing elden ring introduces fresh mechanics such as ashes of war and summoning spirit ashes along with a wide array of weapons an excellent addition to its expansive world while the gameplay remains familiar to previous dark souls titles the added features enhance the overall experience making it feel even more engaging final thoughtsthe game is so vast that there s a lot more i wish i could discuss in this review like its online features and the different endings however i ll keep it short especially about the endings due to steam limitations elden ring features multiple endings and some players choose to end their journey with the default one which i personally find less interesting therefore i strongly recommend pursuing the other main endings as they offer a much more captivating experience than the default one as i conclude this exploration of elden ring i encourage fellow tarnished to venture beyond the conventional and embrace the myriad tales this intricate world has to offer may thou journey be filled with discovery and triumph in the lands between
