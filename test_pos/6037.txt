2019 in less than a day i ve spent about seven hours on this game love the game love the idea of companionship and working together i can always pair up a group of friends or just have me and my boyfriend play together a lot of people complained about toxicity i believe to me i don t really understand how a game like this could be toxic if you can t even communicate throughout the game the only sort of communication you get is before the game you get a minute to ready up when there s a whole squad of survivors and after the game if you stay i haven t played as a killer yet because i m scared of the result but i think i m going to go for the tutorial and try playing as a killer after this review honestly for the price i got it for 10 bucks for the sale it s totally worth it once it goes back up i recommend really thinking before you purchase considering some factors some people may disconnect the game some people may have no idea how to play some people may intentionally have you get killed could be considered still as toxic frustrating but could easily be flipped over if you got some cool buddies to play with all in all i recommend the game because it is fun to play with friends or other people i m more of a person who enjoys to play with other people if you like deceit i recommend this game p s don t complain about a game being toxic when you can t even communicate throughout the game and your biggest threat is another player disconnecting and what game doesn t have any toxicity update playing as a killer in this game is pretty rough you do get a lot more currency though to upgrade characters i can see the toxicity towards the killers because of the perks if the killers chose to unlock their perks i did realize in my first game i wasn t able to kill anybody with one character so i tried another in my second game i did kill and sacrifice three individuals at the end of the game a few told me that camping isn t the right way to win a game ironically i ran across the whole map multiple times like an idiot after explaining to them that this indeed was my second match as a killer and my first time using this killer they apologized and laughed about it with me communication is key during the game at the beginning and most certainly at the end i could of got reported or worse but luckily i didn t i also realized that the game does crash on you so you will disconnect it s not like people intentionally disconnect anyways thanks for reading my review
