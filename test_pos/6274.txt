2021 product received for free when i first started playing this game in 2018 like any new player i was terrified and didn t know wth i was doing even after doing the tutorial which covers the basic controls and objectives of the game it does not train you enough to encounter pro killers disorganized survivors or the bad luck of being the 1st survivor the killer finds lol fast forward 2 years later and i ve learned to love this game with friends and even solo i enjoy the thrill and suspense in the survivor aspect where you can choose and build your characters skills based on their perks and bloodweb all characters have different perks and ways to benefit the team with some being cannon from other video games i e bill from l4d2 or filmography same applies to the killers too i e demogorgon dlc from stranger things i anticipated for a jason voorhees killer but sadly that won t be happening due to copyrights the killer gives you the solo experience of finding the survivors and negating their progress in generators from a first person pov i like how easy it is to build the killers i preferred playing as it has a similar construct with there being a bloodweb and set of perks to choose from i cannot give any advice on how to win as a killer or a survivor nor can i say which side is better because there are too many factors to consider the most organized team can get wiped out by a ghost face or the most experienced pyramid head can still be outsmarted by lower rank survivors because of sheer luck and dead hard the visuals and effects top notch because it takes into account of various details regardless of how minor from dripping blood of injured players to the scratch marks visible to killers from sprinting survivors i just learned about how crows are an indicator of players locations too that was a surprise audio is just as vital for survivors to hear the killers who has a heartbeat and for killers to locate injured players there s the option to adjust the sound and graphics quality too which helps for me to run it on my slightly old gaming laptop it s nearly impossible to pinpoint what the game is missing for visuals and sounds because it s already wholesome as is for both departments as for the developer itself they are indeed adding new dlc killer survivor to the game optimizing map layouts and adjusting the killer stats to make the overall balance as smooth as possible kudos to an active team that s working endlessly on dbd as well as adding events like more exp once in awhile overall it s going to take me awhile before i burn out on this game i enjoy it and recommend it to anyone else who loves horror co op games with the opportunity to play on both sides of the team big thanks to the friend who gifted me this 2 3 years ago edit still enjoy the shenanigans in this game after 5 years and play it from time to time
