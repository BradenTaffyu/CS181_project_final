this review its from a destiny player that after years of bungie negligence decided to quit and try this wonderfull game always saw as destiny but only pve and worse oh boi how much i was wrongthe beginning one reason i started playing this game its because of gauss i saw some videos about him and i was hooked i wanted to try this warframe xd and well was more and more commong seeing my friends playing it and i was amazed by the uniques of every warframe the customization the immense variety of builds at this point i was just too curious i had to try this game my khora 3 a screenshot of warframe by shikii 400h reviewpositive notes the insane variety of warframes and the fact they are very different from each othermy top 5 gauss xaku voruna kullervo octavia bc her music weapons variety real variety not reskins like destiny even the prime versions are different especially the weapons you can make the incarnon version some locations looks amazing like the void duviri fortuna deimos ingame trading you can buy sell items for the premium currency plats so yeah you are not forced spend real money to get the premium currency just go and hustle tenno i think i made at least 3 4k plats until now builds after 400h im still getting lost to how many builds this game have pets companions i love the cat thats it steelpath it s like a ng but very hard or very easy with the right build story especially story quest like the new war that quest can solo most of destiny expansions stories i love destiny lore and some stories like forsaken but this one was so so much better felt like a movie devs not being out of touch with the game its not for granted something like this modern era of games right bungie negative notes old maps locations sucks they are so repetitive and some locations are copy and pasted from other planets some prime packs being overpriced like the new gauss one like 130 i dont have problems spending for games i like but this one is too much confusion if was not for my friends i would pass hard times before the new war the first 100 150h of this game are very confusing and its easy doing mistakes or not farming in a efficient way this game have to be more clear scammers i have to say this is not the game fault but a wanted to point to who is reading this to not get scammed by people in the ingame trading chat most of the people there are broke or want cheap items always check on the market before selling some factions being broken to farm like fortuna its misarable farming for reaching rank 4 5 crafting time like really i have to wait 3days for trying a new warframe what i am playing clash of clans conclusiona beautiful game with some flaws that you can still enjoy it and having a lot of fun especially with friends you can pick it when ever you want having fun messing around with builds and trying something new and it has a lot a lot of things to do its very hard to get bored warframe a screenshot of warframe by shikii
