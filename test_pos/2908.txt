2017 i only play story mode never play online or use any mod so this is a review simply based on the original single player portion of grand theft auto v if you buy this game to play online mode please just ignore my review i think it is a great game maybe the greatest game i ve ever played i buyed it by full price in 2017 it s still worth the price pros extraodinary story three protagonists micheal travor and franklin two americans and a canadian trevor with totally different characters i love franklin he is cute interesting npcs funny plots and quests a very large and well designed open world map which depicts the whole city of los angeles pretty nice graphics well optimized even my old pc can run it smoothly by the lowest level of graphics you can select first person or third person happy single player experience of 40 hours hard to aim when shooting that little white point is too small to find 2017 11 11 edited seems that this can be changed in settings overall rating 9 7 10
