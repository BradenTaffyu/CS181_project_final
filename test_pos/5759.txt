2015 most reviews have given this game pretty good reviews with the same cons for almost every review they keep pushing the fact that there isnt enough depth as someone with over 900hrs on csgo and having played it since 1 6 i can say that depth is relevant people play dust 2 all day long year in year out without becoming bored becauseit is the human adversary that adds depth and continual change to approach every round this game has a multitude of option on operators that arent merely skins but offer different ways to achieve victory thatsuit your approach eg wanna bust through the front door then take a meat shield and let your team walk in behind you there are so many options on entry poitns that every match is significantly different this is a great game that deserves your attention if you enjoy team fps games that require a little bit of planning each round the graphics are not mind blowing but serve to allow a large diversity of gamers access which is only going to give the game a longer shelf life the sound is amazing with headphones and using sounds are paramount to victory it took a little bit of fiddling to get the game running the way i like in terms of fps and look etc but otherwise the servers have been great and as an aussie im getting 35ms and yet to have trouble getting a game under 20 secs i hope this helps you to make a decision but at the very worst you can get a refund using steam support if you dont like it cheers
