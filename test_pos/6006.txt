2018 long review incoming edit i decided to edit my review after getting to know the game a bit more the original review was after 70 hours of playing and this one is after 300 hours the comments below reflect the original review dead by daylight is a 4vs1 online multiplayer game one player plays the killer and the other three or four players are the survivors the survivors win by working together to repair the generators and then opening the door without being killed the killer has to find the survivors and hook them all to please the entity pros the perks each survivor and each killer have unique perks perks are basically equippable abilities that help you in some way some examples are claudette who can heal herself and meg who can sprint away quickly customizing your survivor or killer adds variety to your character and lets you create your own play style items the item system adds more tension to the game you have to level up to get items but you lose the one you brought into the game if you die thus resulting in a risk if you bring a really great item into the trial if you are a killer you already have your main item and you can then attach addons there is a nice variety of items that all have different levels of quality atmosphere the atmosphere in this game is superb there are several different sounds that add heavy ambiance but also serve as audio cues for both survivor and killer i recommend quality headphones to really get immersed the horror the sounds the heartbeat the rush to the generators while constantly watching your back it s a survival horror game and it does a great job at making you feel like you are being stalked meanwhile if you are playing the killer you have a feeling you keep seeing a survivor in the corner of your eye teamwork other then working together on the generators your team can help you in other ways other survivors can unhook you heal you and use flashlights to try to save you from the killers grasp if you with the right people working together can be a lot of fun killers i know i ve mentioned this before but there is a nice variety of killers that all feel and function differently they each have a power that sets them apart along with the unique perks for example the wraith can turn invisible the hag can teleport to her traps and the trapper can lay out bear traps for survivors to get stuck in they have different speeds audio cues etc it s a lot of fun to try them all first person third person perspective the killer can t be killed but he does have a weakness his vision survivors see in a third person perspective meaning they can see all around them in a wider angle meanwhile the killer can only see in a first person view which gives him tunnel like vision this makes it easier for survivors to hide when they have nowhere to go i think this was a really neat idea that really balances out that part of the game and let s you show off your stealth abilities the killer is faster and deadlier but the survivor can better scope out their surroundings cons not newbie friendly originally when i wrote this there was no tutorial they just added a tutorial which is really great the game still leaves out a lot of very important things that they only tell you on the tip screens i honestly think games like this should have a log in the options menu where they store their tips also the community isn t always welcoming to newbies and they can make it very hard to learn when you have no idea what you are doing dlc microtransactions most of the non liscensed killers used to be dlc along with a whole bunch of item packs they finally added an in game store where you can buy the non liscensed killers for shards currency earned by playing although a great improvement they also added in some seriously expensive microtransactions i m talking five dollars for a shirt expensive right now it s just ouftits but it feels like it could lead to worse things bugs this game is not as buggy for me as the reviews say i think they patched most of it i do get some bugs here and there though i think the servers are the worst part i get kicked a lot and sometimes it doesn t let me join a game it s not enough to ruin the experience but it does take patience on its bad days community i think this is the worst thing about dead by daylight all pvp games have trolls but dbd has an especially toxic community after most matches i m surprised when i don t get insulted especially playing the killer because people hate to lose and they make sure to blame it on any term they can such as camping tunneling even if it s not true this usually happens when you go up in rank so if you play casually you won t have as many issues my friend suggested unranked lobbies and honestly that idea would fix a lot of issues with the game i highly recommend playing with friends since you can guarantee more fun i still play online with strangers and although it has it s share of trolls it still doesn t ruin my love for the game verdict if you are interested in the trailer or description then you should grab the game it s exactly what it advertised and it delivers on most positive aspects there are issues with bugs and a toxic community which is why i recommend you buy it on discount if you plan on playing it with friends instead of online it would probably be even more fun
