i was having issues at first but after some settings adjustments it runs fine now i capped my frame rate and turned off all the unnecessary graphics bloat a crash here and there but the game does a decent job of auto saving most of the stuff you can buy for real money can be earned in game nothing you can only buy for real money actually matters one save file is lame combat is solid playing as a fighter i can t speak on the other vocations story is interesting enough so far to keep me hooked if you like arpg s you will probably like this one a lot of the criticism i see is valid the constructive stuff at least but try to remember when you are looking at reviews that people have been planning on dumping on this game for being woke for a while now pay attention to the review itself and decide if it sounds like someone who wants to play the game and can t or it sounds like someone who wants to hate the game no matter what
