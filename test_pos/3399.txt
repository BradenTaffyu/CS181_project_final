this game is close to 9 years old i m pretty sure everyone played it who wanted to or saw a video about it except me i finished the story today and i played online back in the days gta v has probably the most well designed game elements in all of gta games new vehicles types heist missions different free roam activities special vehicles different scenarios in missions and so on the story is also interesting following 3 protagonists around los santos and in it s state and even though there are not many big twists in the story it s enjoyable for sure graphics is pretty nice sound design and soundtrack is well made online modes are much more expanded comparing to older gta games this game is definitely and improvement on most parts however for me it has too many game elements to follow either in single or multiplayer but multiplayer is much more complex it s just really hard to wrap this game around my head without knowing what to do or what should i do not even mentioning the controls they are not bad but difficult to get used since you have so many functions for many buttons for me it s quite to task to play this game about multiplayer i still don t understand what i should bother with it or avoid guys who would take me out all the time difficult to understand and more difficult to play it alone or without any help this is definitely one of the most well known games on earth lots of people favorite game but for me it s just hard to get used to it i admire the different and new elements which it has but gta v feels a bit too much and overwhelming on the new things or on content feels like it s drawn out but still for a single player standpoint it s pretty fun and lengthy and overall a good game but not my favorite for sure 30 is a bit too much even though you would get stuff for the online mode so i would get it around 10 15 depending on your preferences with the online bonuses
