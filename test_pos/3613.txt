2015 i couldn t enjoy this game on a console but maybe it s even better because i was familiarized for the first time with gta v on pc the game is well optimized and polished didn t notice many bugs yet the graphics are stunning even at medium settings the gameplay is way more developed in comparison to gta iv and the story is promising to be very interesting i don t regret any cent i spent for this game totally worth it
