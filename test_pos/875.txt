elden ring was my first soulslike it was kinda overwhelming when starting but i had tons of fun in my first blind run like that s the great part of elden ring you don t have to be this awesome souls veteran to be able to enjoy the game you can just take your time with everything explore the beautiful world enjoy the view and smaller bosses the game doesn t push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in game you re not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on until you re strong enough to continue your journey you can just keep exploring will eventually level up in the mean time if you re not getting any further with a specific boss then you can just leave it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead
