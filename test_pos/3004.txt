2016 great game awesome concept there s so much you can do in both multiplayer and singplayer in this game it s simply amazing it s not all rainbows and sunshine tough pros graphics one word astonishing fps the game runs very smoothly if your pc can handle it if not i don t recommend you buy the game buy a better pc instead gameplay it s the classic gta run over people get chased by cops rob stores etc very nice storyline great storyline very interesting since you have three main characters you can switch with all the time the missions are smooth and i have not encountered many bugs heists and missions multiplayer i absolutely loved the heists same goes for the missions except for the loading screens it s all very smooth cons modders since the last patch in multiplayer i rarely encounter modders anymore be careful though price although this game is so great i think that it s still a little overpriced for normal people like me or i m greedy i recommend buying it on sales if you can loading screens the game is basically a loading simulator you have to wait a long time for basically everything you do in game changing lobbies starting a mission heist starting a race the loading screens can take up to several minutes of waiting which in my opinion is bans this hasn t happened to me or my friends yet but there s a lot of stories of people getting banned for apparently no reason sometimes it s because they modded in singleplayer or joined a hacked lobby i don t know any more about this topic than the stories i ve heard though grinding to get a cool car you have to get a lot of money how you either grind missions for money like the last heist or you buy shark cards for real money i think that it s fun to do a heist two times but after the fifth time for just one item you want that costs a lot is just boring and bad flying with mouse if you re a greedy like i am and you don t want to pay for a controller you might find out that controlling planes with you mouse is hard as but that s just my opinion maybe i m just bad conclusion it s a great game if it s on sales and you have a pc that s good enough i definitely recommend this game be careful with modders in multiplayer and modding in singleplayer though since people get banned for that lately i give it a solid 8 5 10
