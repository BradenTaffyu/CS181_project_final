2022 unfortunately this game has some controversy around its launch that i feel is overblown and judging the game as it is today march 22 2022 i still consider this game to be worth a purchase and your time the negativity surrounding this game is partly related to bugs which have been present in just about every total war game at their launch and the narrative campaign that the game launched with i am not concerned with the bugs in the game right now none of them are game breaking and ca has a history of stamping out the more serious bugs in their previous games the newest patch notes show that they are aware of and are working on these bugs the narrative campaign is admittedly not my preferred way to play a total war game as i would rather play a sandbox mode but the campaign as it is today is still fun to play and i think more fun than the vortex campaign in warhammer 2 which i played maybe 2 or 3 times in the warhammer 3 narrative campaign rifts will open up at a regular basis out of which will spawn enemy heroes and armies you can close these rifts with your own armies or heroes but if you want to win the campaign as intended you need to take your main legendary lord into these gates where they have to go through a gauntlet battles attrition mazes effectively taking them off the main map for about 10 turns the rifts and the gauntlets themselves were never a big deal for me annoying but not a game breaker for me i was still able to expand a wide empire without my legendary lord on the field the latest patch notes offer solutions to increase the rewards in the gauntlets and even prevent the rifts from opening in the first place which would allow the player to not even interact with the narrative campaign at all what makes me like this game so much are the races just about every race in the game looks fun to play i managed to beat the campaign 3 times in the month since launch and am eager to go back and try another race it is rare that i feel this way as i easily spent a couple hundred hours just playing beastmen in warhammer 2 before their rework the combined map and campaign have not been released yet it has been known that the new combined map will take longer to come out than it did in warhammer 2 so i feel it is silly to expect it at launch or even a month after and until it comes out we only have the narrative campaign to play which is not a problem for me i am having a good time playing it when the combined map comes out i could see warhammer 3 becoming my forever game like warhammer 2 was which is a game that i always have installed and will come back to regularly in the years to come
