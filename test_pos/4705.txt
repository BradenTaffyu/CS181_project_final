2023 just remove the cod hq the games don t need to all be in a single launcher it just makes it 2x slower to start the old game mw2 because you first need to start the cod hq which then loads everything for mw3 multiplayer then you need to select mw2 then it needs to load mw2 s multiplayer again just make them separate games you don t need to be able to launch both almost no one is gonna play 2 games at once i did enjoy mw2 s campaign and mw3 s beta mw2 s multiplayer was pretty ok and mw3 s campaign was pretty anticlimactic so overall i would recommend the games but the launcher thing just sucks
