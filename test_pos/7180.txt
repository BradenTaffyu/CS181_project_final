2017 i flat out did not like this game when it came out bad zombies map bad campaign bad multiplayer however after i gave up on it zombies got good personally i believe that the 4 bo3 dlc maps for zombies were mediocre der eisendrake and gorod are the best of the four but shadows of evil is by far the worst zombies chronicles finally gives a reason to play this game gobblegum while being broken makes maps like shangri la actually decent but makes maps like shi no numa crazy broken not to mention that the black ops 1 dlc for pc players is ridiculously overpriced 8 zombies maps for 29 is unheard of by activision standards lately the reviews have been negative due to season pass holders expecting zombies chronicles to come with the season pass to those people i really have to wonder how you could be so stupid first off do you not know how a season pass works and did you really expect to get that much from a call of duty season pass i m sure these same people will buy destiny 2 s season pass and get mad when it doesn t come with the expansions anyway the campaign is at it s worst world at war s campaign was spectacular black ops was intriguing nothing too special but vietnam and conspiricies were definitely out of left field for cod and it was a great gamble on 3arc s part black ops 2 s story was amazing and under rated for sure it had a ton of replayability and a crazy amound of unlocks multiple endings branching paths just great to me black ops 2 was the full package good zombies good multiplayer great campaign black ops 3 s campaign tries so hard that it s garbage the we have to go further into the future meme is getting old and it worked against this game black ops 2 is barely mentioned and it has almost zero connectionsback to 2017 or rather 2015 yeah this game is almost two years old already it s hard to forget that the cod after this game fell on it s face and now it s basically removed from existence infinite warfare is for all intents and purposes a joke my verdict is this if you are a zombies fan this is the game for you period point blank every good zombies map in one package remastered with it s own workshop and ww2 zombies reveal around the corner no better time to be a zombies fan quit the bawwwwwing about a 50 season pass not giving you 80 of content and suck it up you bought the season pass to a cod game oh it s worth noting that this game is only good for zombies quite obviously do not buy it for anything else
