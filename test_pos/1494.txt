2023 this game is a lifesaver having recently purchased a house that does not easily accommodate the space needed for a game of age of sigmar or 40k and having small children that will express their curiosity towards my ineptly painted models with reckless abandon we ve played an obscene amount of this instead it s not perfect but it s tons of fun and allows for a impressive variety of play given how dissimilar the factions are from each other immortal empires really shows this off as does our favorite activity battle modes with points determining the army lists i consider this to be the ultimate fusion of total war as a franchise and warhammer as a franchise and i would be hard pressed to name a strategy game i enjoy more as these two seem to be made for each other the grit and variety of the warhammer setting bringing a plethora of unit options over the typical total war pc game and the focus and grand scale of the total war skin really hones in on the best aspects of the tabletop version of warhammer the lore and the depth of faction options you can distill the essence of this game to the following quote from one of my partner s favorite robot chicken skits i beat up the guy who owned this stuff so now it s mine that s called geopolitics
