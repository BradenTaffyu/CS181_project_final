10 10 would recommend this game the second best thing that came out this year behind elden ring dlc i have to give up sleep the first two day to play this game the only thing that stop me is work t tthe game start off very easy but the difficulty start increasing form each chapter the difficulty increase gradually and without much difficulty spike there are alot of boss in this game the main boss and mini are very well design the gameplay never get bored as you progress through the story and level up to unlock more skills
