2021 naraka is honestly a breath of fresh air in the field of battle royale games while most brs are focused on ranged combat naraka puts heavy emphasis on melee and it feels good the combat system is very similar to traditional fighting games combos counters dodging etc and its honestly the most fun i ve had in a battle royale in a long time of course the combat isn t the only selling point the movement system is extremely satisfying and fun to use anything that you want to do you can do climb up walls stealthily balance on a chain hide in a tree hang from the edge of a roof dive through a window the list goes on you also have the option to use a grappling hook which when used properly can make you feel like batman zipping from building to building visually the game is beautiful there s a lot of detail on things that you wouldn t normally spend very long looking at and of course all of the main elements are amazing as well combat visuals are easy to see and interpret but not so much that they clutter the screen the characters are all unique with their own playstyles and it all seems decently balanced so you won t have to worry about picking the wrong hero its the perfect game to play casually or competitively and i highly recommend trying it that being said it does have some issues if you don t have an ssd you should definitely get one before downloading naraka running it from an hdd causes stuttering and lag spikes its not enough to make the game unplayable but it is very frustrating and menus can take a very long time to load sometimes long enough that you don t get to pick your spawn point before the match starts other than this though the game is very polished and clean and if you have no hardware conflicts then you shouldn t run into any issues feel free to use my referral code if my review helped you decide to give the game a try referral code chh64ajm3w
