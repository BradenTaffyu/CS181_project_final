2023 i grind i sleep i awaken i grind some more i gaze into the void the void gazes back i have not seen the sun in months the grind is all i know and yet without the grind i have nothing i am weary sick beaten down utterly devoid of all that is good in this world and yet i continue for the grind never stops
