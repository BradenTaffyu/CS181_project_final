i m happy to say that this game was worth the wait everything from the amazing set pieces combat characters and attention to detail were just breathtaking to me it s so clear that there was a ton of love poured into this game so many little nods and extra effort put into even the little things that you cant help but be charmed by it all it s very polished only occurred a couple minor bugs throughout my playthroughs and once you figure out how the game works and the map progression plays out it s very rewarding and plays through smoothly i will say though the idea of stances is fun but i never found much of a reason to swap from the default smash stance and just crank out the big damage i don t really have too many complaints besides the combat being a little spammy but that kind of works because it lets you focus instead on learning to react to the bosses rather than managing a ton of complex mechanics on your end i 100 the game because i enjoyed the game so much also bought the 8bitdo black myth wukong edition controller it s my new go to now definitely would recommend and i believe it deserves the hype can t wait to see what else comes in the future
