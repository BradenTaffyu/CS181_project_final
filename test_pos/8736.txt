2017 early access review absolutely awesome this software is the perfect partner for having a pimped up desktop i for one love it and i don t think i will ever have a desktop without wallpaper engine in it the community is super active and the workshop gets updated daily with addition of plenty wallpapers the built in tools to get you started with wallpaper engine are super easy to work with while being really simple and powerful there is really nothing to hate about this software except for the rare crashes which might annoy you but the chances are pretty low i would however like to add in how i once gifted this to a friend of mine and he just had 0 2 hours in and unlocked the pest 128 error achivement
