2017 video review youtube video views 0 warframe is a third person action game that s most known for its cooperative gameplay its similarity to destiny and its grind in it you play as a tenno which is basically just some superhero warrior in some superhero suit that they apparently can never step out of or something i m not sure even after 37 hours of playing warframe since the game isn t very good at conveying story or lore outside of just typing it all up and allowing you to read it if you d prefer a book to a video game if you re looking for a narrative driven action game turn back now if you want an extremely fun and badass cooperative experience then stick around warframe might just be for you the gameplay of warframe is addictingly fun you run jump and slide around these procedurally generated levels in pre determined missions and kill things solve puzzles and collect loot there s several different mission types from espionage defense and etc you get to upgrade and outfit your warframe some combat pets and every single one of your weapons to your liking with modifications as you level them up and unlock better ones new items can be purchased mostly with premium currency or crafted for very difficult to grind in game ingredients as well as a credit fee and credits are an earnable in game currency there are also special missions you can do called archwing missions after you do the followup ones to build an archwing these are literally wings that go on your warframe and come with a special new gun that you can use while flying around in space it s hardly ever relevant but a cool feature nonetheless the gameplay however can end up getting just a little repetitive since in all honestly you mostly just have to spam e to win for most missions but overall the gameplay is what will keep you coming back to a game like this it s especially fun when played with anywhere between one to three friends playing it by yourself would be rather boring i imagine which is why i didn t really try that the game is really designed to be a cooperative experience there s a pvp aspect to the game as well but it s mostly dead i ve never even successfully found a match for it the graphics look fantastic warframe was released four years ago and the graphics don t look outdated at all the sound effects are all really solid and smooth as well they put quality work into their production of effects however there are some graphical glitches to be noted such as how this pet dog you can get that helps you in combat likes to grow to the size of whatever it s attacking when it does a specific takedown move and in areas with bigger enemies this can be quite the sight the game has a few other glitches too it s not the most stable game by any means one example is how i once attacked some enemies and my game froze for a minute as it processed all the hits or something another example is how one time at the end of a mission i got lit on fire and kept dying over and over on the way to the extraction as a result since even dying didn t remove the fire i d talk about warframe s story a bit but the story is highly irrelevant you ll probably only follow it through the tutorial questline there are other questlines too but they re more used to unlock new things than to deliver a narrative if you expect some interesting characters or anything like that then you re looking at the wrong game and finally it s a free to play game so we need to talk about its f2p model well pretty much everything can be bought with premium currency and everything is a to obtain without premium currency its model is entirely one that requires grinding or money to skip the grind it s not that bad since it doesn t impair the fun of the game that much but it can be a little annoying to constantly have to grind for something else you re missing as i m pretty sure if this was a p2p game that this grind wouldn t be anywhere near as grueling as it is the game has pretty in depth customization in terms of how you upgrade everything but also in just customizing the look of your warframe your weapons your pets your ship and everything that s yours the only pain is that a lot of the cosmetics are entirely microtransactions this is another downfall of the f2p system is that you ll have to pay to unlock different colors and ornaments and other fancy looking things overall warframe is a very fun game despite its bugs and shortcomings it s definitely something to be played cooperatively it s biggest flaw really is just the grind it is a boatload of fun in just about every other aspect though i give it an 8 10 it s one of the most fun games i ve played in a while and it s something any action lover with a friend or three should try out it s free after all why not give it a shot at least
