2015 played it for a few hours on pc i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version it seems to run much smoother looks nicer the controls are easy driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together rockstar definitely proved me wrong after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall oh and no more gfwl yes well done rockstar definitely worth buying
