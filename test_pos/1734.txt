2023 product received for free well this one of the games which makes me have sleep schedules started playing the f2p event with sun up looked at the window it was night with a rain lmao that said game runs a lot better than at launch i had stable fps no crash the dlcs i got for free giveaways worked without a problem i must say i enjoyed the prologue history i found easier to understand both tw and tw2 are good but you fight do the campaing just cause that was meant to be few explanations of why tw3 campaign is shorter and easier yeah but i understand a lot more of what i was doin cathay faction took me awhile to understand how they really worked but the micro maneagement of mixing units together buildings together was funny experience my sense of fashion felt bad for the empire of dragons imagine living centuries to have no sense of fashion for your armies kewk kislev and demons won in design with miles ahead what the game got me was the new animations found them fresh to look at than previous titles and i really enjoyed the new effects so after testing this f2p i ll try to sell some stuff in the market and hope i sell it and get the game before it runs out of discount w i def recommend the experience example of animation don t provoke yuri barkov community created artwork for total war warhammer ii by nightlizard tw3 cinematic executions is lit p s i played with a nvme ssd loading was shorther than 1 min saving game didnt took 10s and so on i noticed a lot of complaints of loading time if by the love of ursun you play this on hd it ll will take ages 1 edit super pro i dont own chaos warriors dlc from one welll this game more than delivers their own reskin of the faction with better units so you can save the money on that dlc d strange con you need to reduce graphical setting to minimum to bypass final battle it crashes otherwise i had to google a fix for it well this made a glorious ending subpar game itself is great but final battle i was unable to enjoy due to this p s i ll do a proper full review edit when i actually buy the game and play with all the factions
