2021 i usually don t like br games at all i find them far too boring and reliant on gathering skills and playing like a coward while naraka bladepoint still suffers from general br issues it still feels worth playing and has several ways of forcing conflict along with the classic ever shrinking ring there are quest scrolls you can pick up that promise great rewards if you can complete a small task one of these is the bounty quest which marks a certain nearby player as your target allowing you to track their location to a certain degree that player is also notified of the bounty on their head and whoever survives the encounter comes out of it with a hefty coin advantage to spend at one of the game s many merchant chests melee combat is the game s main focus and verticality plays a huge role on the surface it s a simple rps system lights beat counters which beat focus attacks which beat lights this ends up being a lot deeper due to the varied melee weapons with different strength light and focus attacks and further deepens once you get used to the game s dodging sliding and grapple hook based movement systems all of the weapons have their strengths and the fact that the community has jumped from calling at least 4 different weapons op and broken is a testament to their balance finally the heroes are small in number but varied enough to be interesting none stand out as particularly op although some of their ultimates are more annoying than others once again the community can t decide which hero is the most broken meaning they re probably all pretty viable at this stage i m sure in the future the meta will develop towards favouring one or two but so far i haven t felt like any choice has been overly weak
