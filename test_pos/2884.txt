2018 first rule of gta v if you want to mod don t go online unless you clear the base game folder of any added files otherwise you get banned i learnt that the ban system works like that it sees any change in the base game folder and it triggers a ban so that s it if you mod make sure the base game folder is back to the original state nothing added nothing missing apart from that we all know how gta v and gta online is it s all good the online griindy but not much as day 1 since i come from the xbox 360 version which i played online from day 1 things have changed but its still damn fun
