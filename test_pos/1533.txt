2022 as you ve probably noticed some people have really enjoyed this game and others have not i fall into the category of one who doesn t mind the realm of chaos campaign that many others despise yes at times it can be annoying but as someone who has plays the vortex campaign in total war warhammer 2 i m quite used to this type of campaign and don t need to wait for immortal empires to come out some pros to the game decent faction selection base game has 9 legendary lords from 7 different factions map is very large and allows for diversity in what enemies and friends you come across individual faction mechanics for every faction that adds some flavor to each one skarbrand the exiled punting most characters across the map graphics are pretty good especially on higher settings modding community is wonderful cons immortal empires isn t out yet less sandbox ish for now as you are kind of forced into playing the souls race unless you have a mod that turns it off limited units as of now for each faction especially the daemonic factions cannot play as the warhammer one and two races this doesn t faze me but i know it affects a lot of people that fancy playing the empire for the 50th time anti player bias still is strong but much better than what it was at release back in february of 2022 conclusion personally i think the game is worth it and it is only going to get better as we progress further into the year if you are waiting for immortal empires then i would hold off until later this year when the beta gets set up for that if you really want to try out new factions like cathay which is new ish to lore and the daemons then i would recommend getting this game i hope this helps you all make a good decision
