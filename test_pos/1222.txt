2022 elden ring is a good game but unfortunately it s very poorly optimized i kinda dismissed the other reviews saying how bad the frame drops are thinking they re exaggerated but i experienced them myself throughout the whole game i m not sure whether it s just bad optimization or because of the easy anti cheat but the frames stutter constantly some areas more than others but it s just something you have to deal with through the game this is also something i heard from pretty much everyone i talked to this is not an issue of hardware rtx 2070 and ryzen 2700x elden ring takes a lot from fromsoft s older titles and improves on most of them the game is way more accessible with a lot of ways to make the experience easier and also some very welcome quality of life changes which i hope they will continue with and expand on future titles being an open world has it s draws though as if you re a fan of dark souls old world design then you re not really gonna find that here another thing to note is that there is some cut content that s still half in the game and while it s not much you do notice something s off as well as a few bugs here and there online play is terrible in coop and especially invasions you re gonna have a bad time if you even manage to connect and stay connected throughout the whole thing one time i even got an inappropriate activity detected error and was booted to the menu unable to go online this probably was caused by some sort of false positive in easy anti cheat as i understand it happened to many people during that time and was later fixed but still an unpleasant experience as much as i like fromsoft i expect better from a triple a product
