2019 tl dr i bought this just for zombiesbuy zombie chronicles if you have a friend to play withlocal coop is a thing campaign was uninteresting until the last mission so don t play the campaign opinion i seriously bought this game just so i can play the remastered zombie maps and custom maps too most of my hours is just from playing zombies this game is very enjoyable playing with friends especially with local coop enabled even more fun if another friend has a copy too thus having 4 players sitting in one room shouting revie me this game only offers 1 zombie map to its base players shadows of evil shadows of evil is a fun map to play but you will need time to adjust and learn especially trying to complete several tasks for the pap for the zombie chronicles i only recommend to purchase that dlc if you have a friend to play with because very few maps are played such as origins and kino much smaller than origins campaign oh boy i didn t believe what others had said about the campaign as boring terrible confusing or barely referencing the past black ops games after playing the campaign i felt i wasted my time the campaign is bad but i did enjoyed the last mission as it was a bit trippy i had to look up how everything tied together which then made sense it is quite unfortunate that the price of this game hasn t dropped significantly or at least some
