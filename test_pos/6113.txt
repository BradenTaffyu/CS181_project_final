2020 kids everyone casual players pro players potato really bad bad ok good beautiful masterpiece full price wait for sale average refund it if you can don t do it 90 pc minimum medium fast high end nasa computer you just need 2 arms ez easy to learn hard to master hard first few hours dark souls really short 0 2 hours short 2 8 hours few hours 8 12 hours long 12 hours endless it doesn t have still better than twilight average good fantastic the game itself is one big bug bugs destroying the game a lot of bugs few bugs nothing multiplayer yessingleplayer nooverall has a very repetitive sense of two different playstyles where killing requires significantly more concentration a survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an m1 simulator if you don t involve yourself with the game much this receptivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different powers which can tilt the game at any point if you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood i would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time it s a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared there is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn in game but achieving the grind and getting the perks massive game factor that you want that will greatly change the way you play it s just amazing and the game i turn on every day for a good 6 hours
