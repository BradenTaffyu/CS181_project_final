the majority of negative reviews in a nutshell 1 i didn t coordinate with my friends on which server we were going to play on so i am now mad at the world that we cant play together and i have to start over on a new server and i lose my progress 2 the typical tos misunderstanding that these cyber security expert wannabes flail around recklessly without actually understanding what the tos means tldr the game is backed by gdpr guidelines and if it was breaking them it wouldn t be sold in the us 3 queue times for servers the game just released every new mmo server hosted game has queues on release get over it my review so far this game has delivered on every single aspect of survival mmo looter shooter that i have wanted in a game albeit sometimes it can be a buggy experience or it can lead to weird interactions with npcs really needs work it has been an incredible experience and i will continue to support this game until it either puts p2w features in or somehow the experience is sour after the wipe either way i love this game so far and recommend it to anyone who likes the division rust palworld scp death stranding or control as it has small aspects of all of those games all jam packed into one awesome and intense package and yes its still fun even solo great work starry studio
