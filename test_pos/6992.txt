2021 the future is black treyarch delivers once again with one of the top rated call of duty game s in the franchise already with a lot to live up to being the sequel to the fan favorite black ops ii the third installment in the sub series grants a stellar multiplayer and cooperative experience although with a lackluster campaign despite it s poorly done story egregious micro transactions and debatable price tag for 2021 black ops iii shines brightly in areas that overshadow it s shortcomings zombies youtube video official call of duty black ops iii zombies chronicles gameplay trailer

duty as custom with treyarch call of duty s black ops iii returns with it s next installment of the famed horde mode 4 player co op solo survival experience likely the reason most of you will purchase on steam black ops iii is the definitive zombies experience to this day though it asks that you invest more money into it for it s full offerings as it s now standard for the zombies chronicles 5th zombies focused dlc pack to be included with standard editions purchasing grants you access to the launch shadows of evil map as well as 8 gorgeous remasters from previous installments giving players a healthy mix of complex and casual maps if you manage to purchase the vanilla standard version you will only have shadows of evil with additional maps available via season pass or la carte exclusive to the pc version black ops iii fully supports the steam workshop allowing users to create share and download additional content with multiplayer server browser support mostly utilized by players to create fully customized zombies maps breathing a lot of variety and longevity to the steam version specifically as with the multiplayer bo3 zombies unfortunately falls victim to activision s unsatiated past greeds in it s micro transactions though not to the same extent through a system of mega gobblegums grants players some debatably broken and pay to win consumable gameplay advantages players can earn by playing or accelerate the process via in game purchases chances to roll a literal virtual slot machine and stack up their bonuses for use in game some are so strong that it honestly ruins the experience but you can control this to an extent by choosing to not use them or agreeing with your team to stave off of them though in public matches you have next to no control over someone breaking out some overpowered buffs if you re looking for call of duty s best zombies experience you get black ops iii on steam multiplayer youtube video call of duty black ops iii e3 2015 multiplayer reveal trailer ps4 ps3 views 2 588 063 call of duty black ops 3 expands the possibilities of call of duty multiplayer the new movement system allows players to fluidly chain movements together while playing in maps that have been while this is one of call of duty s best multiplayer experiences with incredible depth movement based gameplay and progression it s unfortunately heavily hampered by it s age as custom with cod each year that passes the lack of support increases as the player population dwindles particularly on pc platforms as there is no crossplay this problem becomes even worse when you own dlc maps as it tries to match you with other bonus map owners constricting the matchmaking pool further actively punishing you for paying more money with no option to disable the maps for matchmaking besides uninstalling them which is far from ideal unless you re interested in only playing team deathmatch with high ping exploiters and cheaters i d highly recommend against purchasing black ops iii expecting the fantastic multiplayer experience of it s prime if you re looking to play a remnant of it s offerings i d recommend playing the ps4 version though it doesn t have steam s vac support it s evened out by the restricted accessibility of cheats on console however exclusive to pc there is some fun to be had through steam s workshop with custom maps and weapons created by the community with a server browser to utilize it though if you re not at all tempered by this and are strictly interested in black ops iii s multiplayer you can get it for a fair price via the multiplayer only starter pack version campaign i m not even going to bother linking the trailer for this as it does not give an accurate representation of the experience you ll receive through black ops iii s campaign mode though the gameplay is good features 4 player co op for the first time in the series since world at war and shares multiplayer s movement based gameplay in addition to it s own unique and really cool exo abilities and can be fun in it s own right it s all hampered by it s short and bad storyline that feels like a chore to get through defying expectations in all the wrong ways black ops iii has very little connection to it s predecessor s narratives with only a handful of small references attempting to pull off deep psychological storytelling it falls completely flat as it s just not that interesting and poorly executed some fans have convinced themselves that once you fully understand it s tucked away storyline that it s actually a good one i fully understand it and i also understand that it s still sh t regardless a huge shame as black ops ii set a new bar for call of duty s narrative and is unfortunate that black ops iii s good gameplay and longevity is wasted on this uninteresting mess i do not recommend purchasing black ops iii for it s campaign for any reason as it s by far call of duty s worst campaign experience black ops iii also sports a few bonus modes though only one really being noteworthy dead ops arcade 2 a worthy sequel to black ops 1 s top down twin stick shooter zombies experience only improving the fun variation of survival freerun a very light parkour mode allowing you to hone your movement speed and combat skills in 4 different courses with leaderboard support nightmares take black ops iii s campaign replace almost all the enemies with zombies make it cheaply switch around the mission order and somehow make the narrative worse than the base campaign this mode will give you nightmares over how stupid it is but it is good for some dumb fun in conclusion black ops iii is a great game and is widely considered one of the top 5 in the series despite it s flaws and age for good reason call of duty s notoriously don t decrease in price besides the occasional sale a few times a year excluding dlcs however due to it s zombies offerings black ops iii is the most reasonable to purchase out of the franchise if you want it and want it now always consider steam keys for a better price though keep in mind not all keys include the zombies chronicles dlc to provide additional credence to my review i ve played black ops iii for 2 000 hours on the ps4 version
