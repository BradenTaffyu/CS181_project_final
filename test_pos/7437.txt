2020 well i was about to say that this game is totally undeserving the hype and is a bad game but it has these burps of greatness which changes everything let me explain it is really atmospheric and open to imagination rather than grind first night i was playing sot we were four friends and two were actual seamen it was understandably epic to act like pirate crew while using all the lingo of actual sailors trying to get into battle however it was the second night i played the game which actually hooked me me and two others had this mid tier ship and i decided that we should be pirate hunters instead of pirates since everybody is complaining about pvp in forums and wanting pve i thought hey i guess we can make friends and it would be great to experience the other side for a change we ve traveled around for a while with random quests and found this riddle message in a bottle eventually leading to this avian themed island with bird like statues it took us so long to get the riddle right one of our crew members passed out from drinking in real life so we put his character in brig holding cell in our ship after we solved the riddle as the remaining crew members we ve decided to get the goodies to an island with merchants and on our way we had an encounter which went friendly after announcing ourselves as such we were now sure that we can sail friendly and only engage if necessary or to hunt more notorious pirates after all notorious ones are easier to identify heavily modified ships are more likely to be owned by experienced players which in turn more likely to be hostile on spot due to being more confident with the game couple of minutes later we left the port again we were chasing around another ship to ask whether they saw any pirates hoping they would say yes us so we could start a fight and end the night in high note with all the shenanigans and found one lone ship anchored near a field of debris much to our disappointment this group turned out to be friendly as well and pointed us further north for pirates we in disbelief and sure they were lying sailed north anyways to maintain character but also keeping an eye out for this one ship on our back then suddenly loud noise of cannonshots two ships one manned by undead came out of nowhere and guns started blazing the last thing i saw before leaving the ship with a keg of cannon powder was kraken s arms raising up i lit the barrel threw the keg at this huge tentacle and swam as fast as i can to get away shouting help towards the crew we just had a chat my ship went down but i survived the ordeal with heavy injuries yet the undead ship followed me to battle with these guys as well i immediately jumped to this unknown ship s guns shouting friendly friendly and started bombarding while good captain tried to rout away from both ships and a storm i must add at this point that we were not sharing a common language either i landed enough shots on the other ships or captain was good with his trim but we got away sound of sea and the wind went back to normal checking the ship i saw only the captain was alive the other crew member i don t know what happened after a minute of silently emoting respect i saw something shining on the sea a bit behind us closer to the battle zone you see i had to check it shouting one last farewell i jumped off the ship ofcourse i was trusting the friendly mermaids for a ride back home among some barrels floating i found this peculiar blue stone most likely from another ship sunk by the undead crew or the second ship which attacked us at the start of the fight i wanted to take the stone back home with me but the damned mermaid refused to take me back with the stone in my hand so i decided to make my way to the nearest island swimming angrily to the stupid mermaids everything was well until i saw a fin on the surface of the water got attacked by the shark almost immediately after i saw it raising my pistol i spent my last shot on the predator and immediately started slicing it with my new sabre to my suprise it didn t take too long for this shark to be mortally wounded and somehow i survived yet again i made my way to this rock formation which i initially thought was an island and climbed a bit to use my spyglass there were no sign of life for miles the damned mermaid below me i was checking for other ships to get a ride hopefully not giving up on this blue stone sapphire of the mermaid or something it was one really long day for papenbard the privateer that is where i left off an amazing adventure for me what is even better when i get in the game next time it will start in a tavern with a mysterious stranger commenting something like aha another new face that was quite the celebration when you arrived i am not surprised you don t remember it it is atmospheric edited for typos clarifications
