2016 i think i ve played this game enough to make a list of pros and cons that it has based on my point of view so here they come pros gameplay feels very fluid and adrenaline has new gameplay mechanics but not too far away from call of duty s style graphics zombie mode it s cool how much stuff they added in this mode over the years even though i m a big fan of more simple maps like nacht der untoten shi no numa a lot of customization options dedicated servers black market a lot of unlockable stuff this is the first call of duty on steam where you don t have a different game for each mode campaign zombies multiplayer cons it is set in the future i m not a big fan of futuristic stuff they ve ridiculed the game some customization options stupid things the characters say the actions you can do at the end of a match to taunt your opponents since the cod community on pc is much smaller than it is on console sometimes it struggles to find a match and some game modes are totally unplayable due to low amount of players some guns feel unbalanced campaign i m not saying it s bad but it doesn t come up to my standards of single player experience it is too far away to be competing with waw mw microtransactions the time between the end of a match and going back to the lobby is too muchto sum up i recommend this cod it s always big fun playing it especially with friends and the cons definitely do not make it unplayable
