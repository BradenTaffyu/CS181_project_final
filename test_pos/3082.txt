2015 hello community i have decided to write a review about gta v first of all i love the game series sooo much and i have played them all since gta 1 so i hope that my review will be quite objectively please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me after playing gta v more than 300 hours i think now it s time to discuss buisness pros the singleplayer in this game is awesom there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more the storry from singleplayer is great good redline through the game with lot s of fun missions and great heists graphics on high end pc are quite nice could have been better d fantastic ambience throughout the whole world amazing masterpiece of soundtrack the radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect tv and internet all thumbs up dcons the multiplayer i have waited sooo long to play a gta game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people but it is impossible permanent laggy gamesessions connection errors all the time friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently hours of loading screens i m running this game on high end pc with ssd drive and still loading for hours very low payout rate of money a friend played gta v on ps3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever which takes me to my next point hackers the damn game is full with hackers everywhere rockstar doesn t seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time jumped through 5 puplic lobbies encountered 7 hackers breaking the whole realm shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons teleporting with godmode screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker i m sick of them i also am sick of players joining the lobbies first question asked is there a hacker here i need money wtf such a holes should be banned too right from the moment they typed in this question don t missunderstand me here i have a 0 tolerance policy for hackers they ruin everybodys game expierience and people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion last words i really love the game and i will continue to play it but i m not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance i will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design the multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me drockstar please solve the hacker problem i would totally recommend gta v to everybody but be aware of the multiplayer maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price you will totally not regret buying it then best regardsboudewijn ijzenarm
