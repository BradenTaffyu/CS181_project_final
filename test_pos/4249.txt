2017 as someone who is very asocial and not a team player i can honestly say this game kinda broke me out of that shell i m not one for online games that requires social interaction but this game becomes so addicting that it makes you wanna work with others to get sh t done though you don t necessarily have to play with other people if you don t want to but it s a lot faster trying to get things accomplished the game is very grindy rng heavy and requires a shtload of investment if you wanna make any real progress so if you have a life then avoid this game lol there s been times where other players have p ssed me off which is any online game really but i ll get to that at the bottom of this review you are a warframe aka tenno think of a space ninja lol there are enemy factions at war with each other your job is to fight them you can do spy missions defense missions defend cryostasis pod exterminate missions kill all enemies etc at the end of these missions you get rewards like blueprints to make weapons and new warframes component parts credits in game currency mods which you can equip on your weapons and warframes mods like melee damage 90 etc you can customize the colors of your weapons and warframes customize the interior of your spaceship you can have a sentinel or pet to assist you in battle just all kinds of cool stuff here and there then there s this other currency called platinum which you have to buy with real money or another way to get platinum is to farm for prime parts to sell to other players you need this if you run out of space to use weapons and warframes or if you want to buy accessories for your appearance speed up the building process of weapons warframes etc personally what i think is a pain in the az are the wait times you have to endure when building sh t oh what s that you finally got all the parts to build the warframe or weapon you ve been wanting it ll only take 3 f ckin days to build it d don t like waiting that long spend some plat to speed it up don t have plat welp guess you ll just be waiting then d or you can you know buy some plat d oh and don t forget to take your master rank test to increase your rank to use better weapons etc oh you failed welp 24 hour wai what the f ck then of course before you can even build your stuff you need the parts first which requires mindless grinding and a chunk of time and there s no guarantee you ll actually get the specific parts you want because of the rng system like for example there s prime versions of warframes and weapons you can get and in order to get them you need to get relics objects that you obtain from doing missions which hold specific prime parts within them to get the prime parts from the relics you need to do void fissure missions which is basically you fighting these holy looking azholes and getting them to drop this stuff called reactant which will crack open the relic once you have 10 reactant sounds easy but the problem is that there are 6 prime parts in the relic and the game randomly picks an item out of the relic or if you re playing with 3 other people the game will randomly pick 1 prime part from each persons relic thus making farming a bit easier so that gives you an idea of how time consuming this process can be when you re trying to farm for something specific this game is nothing but poke and hope and saying hey guys look at this stuff i have that you don t have and definitely isn t for the impatient lol that s all i ve been doing for almost 700 f ckin hours not that i m complaining but yeah this will suck the soul out of you and possibly turn you into a warframe crackhead as for the warframe community this game surprisingly has some really nice people that are willing to help you out if you re not afraid to ask and in a way i guess it makes sense considering this game literally doesn t teach you sh t doesn t handwalk you at all barely gives you any instructions as to what the f ck is going on and how to play the game i had to look up most information on the internet the warframe wiki and a bunch of youtube videos i think the developers need to step it up in that department as well as other aspects as mentioned above i m very asocial and hate people but this game kinda showed me that not everybody on the planet is a d khead with the mindset of a 12 year old one random guy saw me asking for help in the region chat decided to personally message me and spent like 400 000 credits to upgrade some mods for me and spent a bit of platinum to help me out completely shocked me i ll be honest although some of the players on here are big babies like actual manchildren no joke there are warframe players in this game with elitist mentalities that will throw fits when you don t play the game the way they want you to play the hardcore math on paper tryhards and it s quite annoying especially for someone like me it s very rare that you encounter these turds but every now and then it happens like this one time i was playing as valkyr prime a very melee heavy warframe and was doing a sortie mission called mobile defense where you have to go to a spot and kill the enemies and keep them from destroying data you re protecting i was playing with 3 other randoms and this guy was btching because i was getting most of the kills said he can t stand valkyr and told me i need to pick a better warframe lol i m sorry but last time i checked i thought it was valkyr s job to go around and tear sh t apart lol i mean honestly it s not my problem if you re slow at killing enemies but i m the one that needs to pick a better frame don t whine and b tch to me go cry to the developers and tell them to nerf valkyr if you don t like it lol on that note i think i need to take a break from this game because f ck anxiety xdi do enjoy the game though i d be lying if i said i didn t so thumbs up
