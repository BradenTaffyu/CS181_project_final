2015 i have to admit that prior to the purchase of this game i had gotten many comments as to how the game wasn t worth 60 simply for its multiplayer however having played the game now i can say that i ve logged 30 hours within 2 days i think that just goes to show exactly how replayable the game can be even if it only has a handful of maps the reason for this is the ability to reinforce and destroy environments at your own discretion coupled with the abilities of the unique operators that change the game based on which ones are in play i definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a realistic fps that doesn t fail to disappoint
