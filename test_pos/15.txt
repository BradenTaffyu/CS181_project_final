great game really is sadly corrupted with abominable intelligence the bots are shocking the first instance its really notable is the tower defence they dont play the objective they dont target key enemies such as bosses or creatures that buff the swarm i have been left bleed out after one got stuck on a rock silly issues but all with the bots sadly aside from that yeah an actual good triple a developer it might pull me off rimworld for a bit
