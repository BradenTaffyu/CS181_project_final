2020 early access review insanely addictive but unnecessarily cruel it s hard for the sake of being hard which isn t always the best so i d recommend installing mods to counteract some of the frustrating design decisions this might seem like a negative review but it s so damn good really really good also if you don t find any wands after the first level swap the spells of the starting wands for a better fire rate
