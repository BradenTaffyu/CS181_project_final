2018 this game is one of the best in free to play category i tried to play the game in 2014 2 times yet i got bored in first few missions the game felt boring and first story quest felt lame after all that prejudgement my friends kept recommending the game i started one last time after first 6 quests i started to enjoy and understand the mentality of the game i noticed that the fun part is not the level design or the game modes what makes game different is each warframes abilities and types of weapons and melees you can use there bunch of combinations with every weapon mod and warframe each one gives you different play styles and that keeps the game fresh and fun game doesnt teach you everything but community is really good and helpful any stranger from chat or in forums will help you also there is trading in exchange of plat microtransaction that means if you grind enough you can trade your items to but this currency i bought plat for ones with 75 discount it was worth supporting developers after each update they always kept bringing new content and story missions every new patch and quest means more story and more to do you should give it a try but be sure you played the second dream and war within those are the major and damn cool quests every gamer should experience these two quest
