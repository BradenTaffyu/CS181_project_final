a man may be destroyed but not defeated ernest hemingwaythis game is the first souls like game that i actually played from the start to finish i tried other titles but gave up on them quickly after a couple hours so first thing i want to say is this game feels more welcoming to the genre than other titles i don t know where to start about talking this game rich open world very rich combat interesting lore amazing designs it has been a while since i really really felt excited to keep playing one game i wanted to push further my character my equipment my gamestyle as i progressed through the game and see different bosses especially the satisfaction you get from beating a boss after using your equipment optimally is unmatchable i actually felt that i rose to elden lord title from being a tarnished that others has been looking down at lot s of the content is actually optional to progress in the game and i usually skip most of optional stuff in other titles because they are mostly unpleasant chores i felt different while playing elden ring i actually tried my best to not miss anything at all i wanted to see what every loot is what enemies or mini bosses i could see and what missions i could progress i could agree that npc quests are a little bit hassle to follow and usually you might need to check wikis but i assume that is a standart for the genre even that really didn t bother me all because i liked npc s too they were pleasant to interact with and see how they progress with you as their quests go on even if you don t care npc s i think anyone would still be excited to see what loot a dungeon contains in this game because there are lot s of fun stuff out there i found combat fun it is still hard but they were aware about the game they were developing just go out there and grab those different items spells armors swords consumables first it might be a little confusing and overwhelming but you quickly get used to managing items then fight anyone however you desire to they gave you freedom with such a rich list of items as you get better and your equipment gets better you feel the improvement on your way to kill your desired boss if you are a hardcore souls fan you can also beat anything with a stick too whole lore is actually pretty interesting but also hard to follow and learn this is one of the things i assume genre standard so it didnt bother me much game doesn t tell you anything much you read it all from items descriptions npc dialogues and other stuff like that you also actually don t have to learn lore to follow the game though and just play for the combat experience another thing is game does not really lead you much at all so it might be really confusing and overwhelming you can play it blind and keep wandering around till you find a lead or you can pop up a wiki page and follow it too you might think looking at wiki s might destroy your fun but to be honest as someone who finished their first souls like game it really didnt kill my joy because it is better than being stuck somewhere for hours you know this game is a long journey and you ll get the hang of it you just might need a little bit patience and help first couple hours recent open world games mostly felt 80 empty for me but this game is different almost every part is a delightful adventure i am both content and happy with the money and time i spent with this game which is a rare feeling actually nowadays especially with the new titles even if you are not acquainted with genre just don t hesitate and jump for a pleasurable adventure go wander out there and find your favorite equipment find your favorite boss to fight with just sit and enjoy how a spirit of fighting rises within you as you progress through game i am sure most people can enjoy this game as i think this game is really a welcoming and pleasuring one i personally liked this game so much that now most of the other games that i play now feels dull i am planning on buying the dlc now a protracted and tough adventure awaits you tarnished warrior do not give into despair and keep fighting be assured that you will soon be blessed with contentment
