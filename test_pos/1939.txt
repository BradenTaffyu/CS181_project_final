this game takes every survival games best feature and wraps it into one the weird processes people are freaking out over only seem to occur when your files are corrupted post crash from what i can see and from what my team mate experienced they went away after running a repair verification and the information being taken required from people are only related to places that require such things for online play i e china korea places that require that they input something similar to a ssn in order to play to hold them accountable for their activities i don t agree with that but it s got legit nothing to do with me the resetting thing isn t nearly as bad or as constant as rumors made it out to be i ve already spent 40 hours at the time of writing this enjoying myself with all of the different aspects of the game combat is satisfying crafting is satisfying fishing feels almost real progression feels well paced it s easy to get around the map and explore this game rewards you for doing basically anything but not in extreme amounts when you meet certain criteria it rewards you for legitimately made efforts i m 117 hours in now and i ve still got all my stuff i m still having fun the community is generally helpful and the story is getting interesting it s done in phases and each phase is like two months afterword all my non storyline specific items are going into storage and i can rebuild my house from a blueprint with like two clicks and a button press the devs actually listen to suggestions and critiques and openly show the names of banned players hacking or exploiting the game there were about three in my server i ll have to level up again but who cares it s part of the exploration of areas and how we get materials anyway tl dr i m having fun quit being upset about that doesn t affect you and come have fun too get out into the main game world before you make up your mind though because the initial tutorial sucks ass and i ve found a lot of people never make it past that edited at 117 hours
