2022 this game will kill you this isn t i feel like a god but there is always a bigger fish this game will just kill you i have yet to beat one run i have had to legitimately research this game in order to play it to the minimal extent i can this game presents itself as almost nothing if you think its a fun wand builder you re wrong this game is death and if you don t like a game that just kills you because it said you where dead don t buy it the difficulty isn t imposed in a way that makes you say oh i see why i died it instead just randomly explodes you and you are left trying to figure out what just happened can you prevent it maybe some things you just can t if an enemy takes you by surprise you re dead i don t normally enjoy this philosophy in game balance players are usually more reactionary when it comes to rouges you see what you get then you adapt your play style to the perks or weapons you have not in noita you only have the pleasure of playing the way you want once you bend this game to your will though the use of bugs which at this point are just unintended features you need to exploit ever vein you find be so observant around every area and search every area for anything that might be useful add to that reaction times to dodge and understand each situation noita has caught me slacking this game is unapologetic this game is hard this game plays dirty and for that i thank it noita has taught me how to be proactive in a game it has taught me to prepare for each situation it will throw at me i have had to research spells view general maps of how the worlds spawn and learn an entire chemistry table just to know what i am doing in this game finally i have prepared for everything now i just need to react and execute something which i have still yet to do thank you noita you have shown me what goes into getting good at a game i no longer find myself passively gaining knowledge and instead now evaluate each death if something kills me unexpectedly i look into what that thing is exactly noita has taught me how i gain knowledge of games now i just need to get good enough to beat the final boss one final thank you noita don t play this game learn this game it gets my recommendation just don t expect to have fun with the first few days
