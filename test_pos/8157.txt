2022 this is the one and only true spiritual successor to nethack a game that was designed to not be completed ever by most of the players who played it made many years before the modern internet could give you help noita follows this idea perfectly but because of the modern internet it quickly became an incredible community effort to solve some of the most esoteric and unexplained things in any video game i have ever seen the first time you find an area that is off the beaten path you will realize that this game is something far more amazing than it is at first glance as an important note this game features permadeath and is insanely difficult i would like to add that there is absolutely no shame in using mods to remove the permanent death system if you are a player who wants to play this and really can t get behind losing all your progress when you die i am personally far too stubborn to do that myself and because of that i have probably only experienced 30 of the entire game even with my current playtime so take that as you will this game feels like it was wished for not created by a team of people it is a miracle of coding prowess and deserves to be played even if you have to remove the one challenging system with mods to enjoy it do it play this nothing else is like it
