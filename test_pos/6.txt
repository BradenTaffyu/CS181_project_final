i think the game is great but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention i understand they had people to please by releasing it this early but it could ve used more time in the oven as a bad launch can really sour a game s reputation looking at you darktide i d like to get my grievances out of the way before i name the positives firstly requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up and not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release you can t choose lobbies you can t choose to host or join them and you can t opt for a solo run even worse there is zero reconnecting to a match if you aren t playing w friends if you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress and on top of that there is no kick prevention late into a match so if you really wanted to kick at the very end you could second it has terrible optimization all round it loads horribly slow without an ssd i have it on an nvme and it still loads slow sometimes performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 fps no matter what i have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn t keep 60 fps it routinely drops to 40 not to mention any mid range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios third is the combat system it almost feels good small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever armor sustain feels weird in it s current implementation and so does hp sustain the whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine but there is almost no way to sustain hp outside of the overheal bug and apothecary bulwark s ultimate ability 99 of the lobbies i queue on ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance you should get a 5 heal for majoris executions and 10 for extremis and like 15 20 for terminus that and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree armor should have to chipped away by small enemies it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors and we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation at reasonable frames as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes the good stuff here has serious potential the combat when it does work feels awesome there is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you the inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game save the dodge roll astartes would not gow dodge roll the bulwark side step looks apt though between the doom executions the gears of war combat style and the spawn waves akin to the tide games elites mini bosses specials chaff units which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic left for dead formula they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and sometimes difficulty i like this game but i would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes they have the framework up already so if they really care about their players they d make some number changes combat is a super easy fix matchmaking too the optimization might take them longer overall get this game if you think it looks fun but only if you have decent internet and an mid to high end pc
