2021 game is overall a great game depending on many factors which i will go over in this review to start with this isn t a game you can just jump into and be 1 it takes a lot of practice time and commitment overall i ve played this game for 2 400 hours combined between my multiple accounts i have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game mode and the genre of the game i will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions i will admit this game isn t for the light hearted as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community i have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game you will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people there are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are team work communication skill knowledge and memory team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing it s a lot harder to win when you aren t playing as a team any great team requires great communication communication is an important part as well as knowing what to call and when to call it this game requires some skill at the higher levels a lot more skill this doesn t necessarily mean you need to be the best as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game knowledge and memory go together can t have one without the other in this game you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek where to peek how to peek together and more similar situations to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke how to smoke certain positions as well as flashbangs and other utilities in saying that that is mainly only the competitive side of this game there are many other amazing features offered in this game those being community servers arms races demolition casual and other gamemodes this game has a lot to offer in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers you have surf servers and game servers making it a game for everyone if you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game there are many leagues to join i e faceit and similar there is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards this game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime which is totally worth it there are skins but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing now i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below the negatives 1 the community this will be featured in both areas as it is a downfall and a positive the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming 2 learning curve there is a learning curve for this game so don t expect to jump in and be rambo 3 the cheaters this comes with any game but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently the positives 1 amazing game this game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that 2 requires co operation this game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team 3 fun combat the guns have recoil patterns to learn getting a good one tap is quite fun overall combat is a great aspect of this game 4 top selling game this game is a top selling game for a reason allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing fps thats the good and bad quickly summed up i will be updating this review as time goes on i hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and i will get to you as soon as i can if you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you aslong as you know what your in for hope you all have a lovely day and keep on fragging
