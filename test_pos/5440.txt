2016 ubisoft made a step forward in tactical shooters with this game which easily could be called counter strike remastered and developers actually surprised me with how well the game is done from a technical standpoint the game is truly challenging which makes it not quite as fun as say cs go i d say that the closest to siege are hardcore modes of call of duty modern warfare 2 without team deathmatch obviously instant knife kills add to that impression the controls are clunky at times cheaters are quite common and the way uplay is standing between me and the game is unacceptable in single player you hunt dozens of terrorists which is not very exciting and ridiculously difficult even on easy but it s better than multi player only i like siege it offers a quite unique experience but it s definitely not for everyone
