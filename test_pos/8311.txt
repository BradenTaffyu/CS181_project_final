with roguelikes being such a huge easy to make indie genre i often find most of them to be rather underwhelming but this one stands out as a shining diamond among the rough everything from the physics to the alchemy to the spellbuilder to the ridiculous vastness of the world encourages exploring thoroughly and being as creative as possible this game will be more than happy to kill you over and over but as you learn about the spell system each run becomes less of a matter of your luck and more a matter of being crafty with your wands and that craftiness is rewarded in kind as you become an unstoppable wizard god highly recommend
