2018 story mode is something i througly enjoyed istill play it to redo some previouse missions however gta online is just not that fun anymore in nearly every session there is a hacker making the game so unfun to play even withought hackers in the session now that flying cars have been added and all the other stuff introduced in the update people who have had the game for a while have more money than someone eho has just started and for them it s also unfun to play im not saying that i hate this game it s one of my favorites what i mean is that online is just not that enjoyable anymore
