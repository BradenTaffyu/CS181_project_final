2023 i had never previosly played a from software game before elden ring i had very little experience with souls likes my only one being code vein which i had been playing on and off at that point and never ended up finishing by all accounts this is not a game i ever thought i d be interested in but there was so much excitement about it on launch it looked amazing a friend had taken a week off work just to play elden ring and so on an impulse i purchased it too playing elden ring for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten setting the gold that enshrouds the heavens the great tree which begets the pillars of light o tarnished hasten to the foot of the tree elden ring is set in an open world of the lands between it s jaw droppingly beautiful diverse and most importantly very good at encouraging and rewarding exploration i will not say anything more it happened more than once that getting into a new area would leave me in awe and it is really worth experiencing on your own with minimal spoilers elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten gameplay combatthe gameplay loop in elden ring is fairly simple you explore you kill monsters you get stonger by acquiring gear and levels and use all this strength to beat big bad bosses to become the baddest boss of all the elden lord combat feels nice and smooth and it s pretty easy to get the gist of even if you re new you have your normal melee weapons you have bows you have magic and each weapon also comes with a special strong ability called ashes of war and all of it works and looks and feels absolutely amazing elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten and if that s not enough the game offers an ability to summon npc spirits to aid you in battle specifically in bigger fights and boss fights this makes elden ring very accessible to newer players who are trying it as their first from software game don t get me wrong though it is still very challenging best part due to the open world nature of the game if you re stuck somewhere or just don t like the place you can simply turn around and leave return later or not at all it s really up to you controlsyou can play with the controller or on keyboard mouse setup the latter of which works very well so you don t really need a controller if you don t already own one i ll actually go on a side tangent about controls unlike ds3 where it is impossible to get the ui to display keyboard controls which makes playing on kbm an absolute headache of confusion ui in elden ring fully supports kbm you just still need to find how to switch it because the controller controls are considered default sigh and the game itself is nicely optimised for kbm controls not perfectly just nicely you can do everything you can on the controller you may just need a bit of time to figure out some ashes of war with double component there s some clicking trickery involved conclusion all i wanted was to fight to fight as a warrior to the last so why why o guidance of grace will this door not open elden ring is a game that i really want to recommend to everyone but i m sure that despite what i think about it it might not be everyone s cup of tea my boyfriend is still not letting me live that recommendation down but if you enjoy beautiful worlds poetic and enigmatic storytelling and engaging exploration and you aren t afraid to try something scary and new maybe this is something you should really really give a go 10 10 best game ever
