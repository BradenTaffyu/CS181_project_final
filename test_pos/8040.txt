2019 product received for free early access review short version this game is amazing buy it long version noita is a cave exploring adventure with an incredible physics engine the falling everything engine creates a fully destructible world where every explosion could start a chain reaction of immense proportions fire spreads and when it spreads to that pile of gunpowder over there you ll get some wonderful fireworks which just might ignite the coal next to that pool of oil and create an even bigger fire just be careful not to get caught in the flames the interaction of elements fire and liquids like water and oil are beautifully and create a world where everything will fall burn and blow up as it should this creates for some fun gameplay when you try to find innovative ways to kill monsters and find a way forward you fight bad guys with magic you find wands with different spells in your travels each wand has different specs as to how many spells they can cast before recharging etc you can also buy wands and spells in the safe house between each level and there you can also edit your wands and receive special abilities all this means that each game you will use different spells and be buffed with different abilities providing you with different ways to kill your opponents and hopefully survive longer than last time there is a nice variety of enemies that have different ways of killing you and you have to learn the best ways to deal with them of course instead of shooting the baddies you could just light that pile of coal they are standing on on fire and watch them burn or why not drown them in toxic sludge or acid did i mention exploding barrels or just kick a mine cart on them that will work too in noita you will die a lot but you will die laughing most of the time an average game might last for less than 15 minutes but you will happily start a new adventure and try again if you can figure out the archaic language used to name the monsters you might laugh even harder when you get shot by a rynkkyhiisi or are burned to death by a stendari for fans of rogue lite games spelunky ftl etc this game is a true gem and a wonderful addition to the genre and even if you usually aren t a fan of games where you die a lot the wonderful disasters that kill you will help you feel just a little less frustrated and keep you trying after all the next attempt might be the one where you finally get to that hiisi base with the perfect wand for fighting them or not most likely not most likely you will die burning in the fire you started or just get beaten to death by a h mis that you didn t notice because you were busy fighting the group of hiisi on the other side of that burning pile of coal while also being bombed with toxic sludge by a limanuljaska
