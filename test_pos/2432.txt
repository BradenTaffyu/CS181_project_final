2023 i am a 51 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my daughter who is 14 now my daughter got this game last christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and she started playing by the end of the week she had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my daughter as she is always out with her friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside her i loaded into the game chose my character and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my daughter for help and she invited me to a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my daughter since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my daughter closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories thank you apex legends
