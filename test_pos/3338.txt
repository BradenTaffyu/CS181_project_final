2015 yesthis is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of rp roleplaying and the perfected multiplayer that is in gta v personally in these games i go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and i enjoy playing gta before so gta iv hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic i think in these kind of reviews it s important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come gta iv was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that rp aspect as i saw it pros alot more to do in the terms of role playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why skyrim and such are still so played the multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in skyrim there is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and i love it the asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots friends if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don t do the game literally is just for and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play the story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren t heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse online and singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc the ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60 feeling to a game such as this pc master race console beta testingcons public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non stop get killed and robbed etc and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server when you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking the damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it in about like 100 levels which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you this drags away from the initial feel of gta in my opinion the loading there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation the game is the most demanding game i ve played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points game invites there are so many of them and that little ding that you get when you are playing sucks ass cause its so damn frequent and sucks i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can t from my experience when playing with friendswith all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won t most of the time this all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends mods and gameplay enjoyment with so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect this is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun
