2022 there s been a lot of talk about size and scale particularly in open world games elden ring defies the normal and correct criticisms that open world games are full of dull tasks and extensively copied content it s a game full of mechanical choices systems in play and rich environmental storytelling no area of the game feels completely alike and so little feels wasted elden ring is likely to be challenging for most players it being a from software game it has many of the trappings of the other soulsborne games but based on my own experience you are given more varied tools to deal with problems you might be having my favorite thing about the open world nature of the game is if you are having a lot of trouble with a specific spot or boss just go somewhere else for a bit there s always something new to find the final few hours of the game are in my opinion weaker overall the bosses get dirtier stats are scaled against you much more heavily in comparison to the rest of the game as well elden ring suffers from what i believe is an intentional design choice that has been made since dark souls 1 but it s a choice that essentially results in first half of game ends up feeling better than second half overall basically elden ring is an extremely impressive achievement in open world game design and succeeds in being a culmination of all of fromsoft s work up to this point whatever that means to you should govern your decision of whether or not to play it i had a great time and maybe someday i ll pick it up again for new game think i m good for now though
