2021 for the first few games you will face bots since everyone wants to know after about 3 or 4 games you start to face real people and you will slowly get used to the game mechanics and you will find out what weapons you like etc its hard at first but you will get the hang of it with trail and error definetly one of the best battle royale games i have played in a long time highly reccomend
