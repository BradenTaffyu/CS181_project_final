2022 only tech issue i had was some blurriness which was resolved by changing anti alias method the new factions are good fun been getting lots of fun out of it and there are many many improvements over wh2 overall to the point that i wouldn t be able to go back if i wanted to alliances quick diplomacy reinforcement timers actual settlements settlement trading ect but the realm of chaos campaign itself is very annoying you ll get rifts spawning every 30 turns that spew out armies agents and corruption and you get no rewards when doing the main story which leaves you little incentive to do so a second or third time the optimal way to win is just capture a province or two and just end turn until you get the rifts because you are penalised if you try to expand the only way to deal with rifts en masse is to spam heros and sit them at the rift spawns which is incredibly tedious and closing each rift costs 1500 gold if you do it this way so it gets quite expensive to add to this the ai is terrible at dealing with rifts to the point that the entire map except your territory becomes the chaos wastes making it even more tedious due to attrition really keen on mortal empires but overall it s still a massive improvement just not sure why they went for such a tedious and unrewarding main campaign at least i could ignore the vortex
