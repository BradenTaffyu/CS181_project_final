finally a game that really feel fresh and unique still can t believe this game is real and delivered exactly what was shown in so many trailers so many games show amazingly but endup looking nothing like the demos but this game delivered love the story the atmosphere and simple gameplay the graphics are really the cherry on top the only thing it could do better was adding a map but since the game is linear it doesn t matter that much sure it s not an open world game but they never claimed it was it s not a soulslike game like so many were claiming its just a singleplayer action game with tough bossfights a remarkable achievement especially considering it s the first aaa title from a new studio in the industry and from china honestly one of the best games i ve played in this year so far a true masterpiece nonetheless
