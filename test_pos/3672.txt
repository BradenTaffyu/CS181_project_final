2015 this game is beyond awesome love the story the open world the characters this is the second time i played through the story and it was just as fun as the first time i could probably do it one more time if i wasn t so lazy the only thing i hate about this game is the hackers they are ruining the game when you are playing online which is too bad but if you are lucky to find one without hackers then it is a lot of fun
