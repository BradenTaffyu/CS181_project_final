return to monkeee after i ve done two ends of this game i ll be forced to do a positive review better than others aaa games launched this year no cap here better than dd2 and helldivers2 cons yellowbrow is one of biggest cheap designs i ever saw in my life boss literally kept spamming his invicible move on him took me a lot of tries until the rng stopped f w me in another end wukong final boss which has perfect dodge i bypassed first try so the balancing in this game is pretty funny to not say bad chapter 1 2 5 6 exploration were really good and smooth yet chapter 3 and 4 walking the maps and finding the secrets paths was a pain in the arse like a real pain specially third chapter i think it took me three days to fully do everything in chapter three kek ray tracing improves next to nothing at cinematic settings besides eating 20fps for myself i would recommend people with good hardware focusing in cinematic preset instead as i had a stable 58 72fps with everything maxed at 3440x1440 the invisible walls looks like climbable areas and it was funny and annoying at the same time having to deal with it pros anything else besides the cons really ultrawide support cutscene support anime cutscenes doens t has uw support yet i mean it was a really interesting take everytime you beat a chapter it would tell a fragment of wukong story with a nice chinese song playing a different artstyle for each one gameplay i think after you get to lvl 100 you can really tweak your builds for your necessity it has highly custom loadouts in skills you can spent and refund points for free so you re free to choose and tweak your playstyle anytime of the game cosmetics while it doesn t offer transmogs you can upgrade any craftable armor set to highest tear if you like a passive effect of one armor instead of another in a new chapter in chapter 3 you unlock this feature be it the cosmetic look you prefer in a old model or useful bonus for your build you can keep that armor for the rest of the game until mythcial tear while the weapons movesets follow three patterns end game weapons have unique effects such as sprounting lava from the ground or spawning swords from thrust stance the story itself is good with the osts being great too four heavely kings is peak gaming fighting i even felt my testo levels rising up erlang vs wukong a screenshot of black myth wukong by nightlizard graphics were really good using nvidia filters went one step above too tl dr score monkey with stick does bonk
