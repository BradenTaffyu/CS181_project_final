2020 it is a very skill based game in some regards and even as a person with no skills i found the weird physics and bizarre spell combos entertaining enough to make up for the fact i cant actually play the game i do however wish there was some kind of unlockable creative mode where i could mess with the spell combos not having to worry about dying or wand editing in only holy mtn
