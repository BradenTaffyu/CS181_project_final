2015 while the pc version of this outstanding game is new it s been out long enough on consoles that i don t need to go into every single thing about the game so i ll just sum up what i personally like alot and don t like not too much likes the environmentan insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of l a l s to near perfection having been to the actual city several times i could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game the viper roorm ripley s believe it or not museum the scientology center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same when the sun sets and rises all of the lighting is accurate and at times absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around mt chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities it s some of the best weather fx i ve seen in a game because it feels real roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes it truly feels like a living world the satirewhat i feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that s so prevalent in l a across all social classes the rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way it s never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto the signage and radio commercials are also perfect knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself this can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations the charactersthere are many who dislike the characters especially trevor and i can see why but i liked them because of how they played off of one another michael the would be retiree who s juggling family problems franklin a young man growing up in the hood doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle trevor the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey none of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they re all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them the voice actors do an a job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life the first person modenot only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made it s also one of the best fps s in years being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes the radio stationsthere s nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking we built this city by starship or heartbeat by don johnson if you like pop rock country rap trance or even talk radio there s something here for anyone to like dislikes the policethey seem overly aggresive and i don t know if that s a play on the lapd or not but there have been time that i ve simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds also while in a car i ve been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot i could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me the storefrontsi just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but i also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world i d be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games the sub and the helicopterfor me the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode the model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few the helicopter while fun could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets thankfully rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this real time destructionagain like the storefronts i know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we d probably be lucky to get 10 30 frames per second with phys x cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments extra activitiesgiven the sun and sand vibe of l s l a i wish that you could surf and skateboard seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth that s not to say they couldn t add these things in a dlc pack fingers crossed but i just find theior absence strange and overlooked those nitpicks aside this is still one of the best games i ve played in a very long time and with so much to do i ll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time overall score 9 out of 10
