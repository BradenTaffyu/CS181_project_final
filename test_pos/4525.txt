2020 wow just wow usually i dont play free2play games but this one is special the gameplay the movement everything is just so smooth and fast you feel so powerful using your warframe to slice through waves and waves of numerous kinds of enemies the customization is great and vast the community is extremely helpful and very very nice escpecially when it comes to helping beginners of course the developers have to make money some way to keep the servers up and their houses warm so it is possible to buy warframes and vanity items using actual money though all warframes can be crafted using the many resources you find on your missions there are many types of missions in this game there are the typical destroy as many waves of enemies as you can missions there are missions where you have to rescue a hostage missions where you have to capture and hold certain points on the map and many many more all of these missions can be done alone with friends or even with random people which i also recommend since it s a joy to engage with this community all in all i give this game a 10 10 this is a game i played when it was in the early stages and i still come back to very often you definately should check it out it s free
