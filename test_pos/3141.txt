2021 gta5 story mode is very much worth to be played the story presented is interesting and fun to play if you can catch a sale on this and get it for 15 i would highly recommend giving it a try if you liked previous gta s it is worth those 15 however as much as i like gta5 s story mode gta online is a total different story i guess you now expect me to talk about all the evil hackers and cheaters that roam online but that is not the main reason i would not recommend to get gta5 only for the gta online part gta online is extremely repetitive what you do in gta o early on is run some missions for paltry money trying to save up enough to finally buy a business all that said business then is for is adding more missions that can be grinded the worst part is most missions have one version of them so it feels like you play the same thing over and over and over like if you do the grand perico heist as example the prep missions you need to do are always the exact same in the heist itself then the enemy placement is always the same if you would program a bot well he could play and replay the same stuff to a t since there is no variance to it to shake up the gameplay if you like games where all you do is grind the same thing non stop give it a shot especially if you play it with 3 or more friends so as usual everything is better with friends even grind trash like gta o
