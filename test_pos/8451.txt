2021 1 for the price it s excellent due to the following 2 has very high quality wallpapers to use 3 there s a diverse amount of wallpapers to pick from 4 let s you download and store wallpapers that can be switched seen in one spot for quick accessibility 5 you can have the wallpapers running without having the app open 6 doesn t decrease fps uses tiny amount of memory which has a unnoticeable impact for this to be true do the following start up app click settings top right select pause for first three keep running and stop for last two quality settings are up to you click general top of settings screen have first two checked scroll down to video settings enable video hardware acceleration click ok once done summary of what those things do makes it so everything is paused when you re using a program whenever you re looking at the wallpaper if it s animated having audio from minimized program on won t pause it unless you have the program popped up on your screen for the quality i recommend using max for everything unless your pc can t run it it won t affect performance so it s worth having the maximized if possible for the fps i don t see a difference when using 25 or higher but i still keep mine at 60 the options checked in the general section make it so your pc starts up the program in the background and applies the wallpaper whenever you turn your device on so you don t need manually open the app to set the wallpaper for video hardware acceleration i ve heard it makes the program run better and is used a bunch side note to get wallpapers either go to discover or workshop and look around use search for more specific wallpapers double click on the wallpaper or click subscribe to download it which applies it if you want to change it go to installed and click on the one you want to apply it either close out of the program by clicking the x at the top right or just click ok using stop for the 2nd and 3rd option in the performance section of settings makes it so the wallpaper isn t applied at all when in another program and so whenever you go back to see your wallpaper the app gets opened again so the wallpaper takes 0 5 2 seconds or so to show up basically everyone uses pause for those still because the wallpaper will always be there and you don t have to see wallpapers switch out of no where whenever you exit out of a program
