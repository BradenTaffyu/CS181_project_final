the game the overwhelming majority of negative reviews on the game have 10 hours or less of play time and this is a live service mmo and a good number of them are about the invasive anti cheat so many people had a problem with it when valorant did it but it blew over within weeks because valorant is a fun game nobody really gives a damn about some video game company from a different country having their gameplay data keep in mind a lot of hate for this game is manufactured by players from similar games who are not practicing any open mindedness and don t see the good in having market competition if you look anywhere other than the review bomb steam reviews and you look at the charts people love this game the small developer team didn t expect this level of success tfd showcases phenomenal usage of unreal engine 5 it is a passionate project that fits the same genre as destiny 2 and it released right after d2 concluded tfd fumbled it s story sadly they have pretty insane cut scenes though it s the first thing you have to get through to begin enjoying the rest of the game like all games of this genre so players who aren t roped in by the outstanding gameplay and love able characters get shaken off early the end game loop is better than d2 but the game is not as expansive as warframe yet all tfd needs to do to leave d2 in the dust is add in their own raids the game is really fun it s fast paced satisfying exciting and innovative every character is well designed and unique the character building and weapon system has a lot of depth not really a crazy amount but more than destiny 2 visually and stylistically the game looks top tier like i said phenomenal usage of ue5 the game runs perfectly for me but i have a high end computer however the visual settings are vast and can work out well for most players there are many accessibility options and features too nudity and the developers nexon decided to lean heavily into nudity and sexual character designs which i appreciate greatly western developers could never in this day and age it s unapologetic and you either love it are neutral to it or are a twitter weirdo the developer team is doing an amazing job they constantly make smart player friendly decisions and are lightning fast with hot fixes they are so in tune with the player base it s wild it has become so rare to have a triple a developer team who listens and communicates so well with the players even across the korean english language barrier they make huge changes in response to community feedback within days and they ve literally been working overtime to meet the demands of hardcore players really they need a break problems i ve had to delete so much from this part of the review because the devs just fix everything i really think there are only a couple of problems in this game first is the monetization anything you can buy in warframe you can buy in tfd except the currency is twice as expensive everything in this game is painfully expensive there is no trading system which upholds a high level of in game economic integrity that warframe lacks f2p players don t have to be affected by spenders in any way i think the worst thing about warframe is how you can buy things with real money and then trade them it s important for me to mention that only a couple of systems in tfd can be sped up by spending you can buy characters upgrade materials that are easily earn able without spending but somewhat time consuming the monetization is not overbearing community for now tfd is not plagued by the elitism and weird internet subcultures that ruins the destiny 2 and warframe communities we re excited for the future of tfd where we have already seen more characters bosses zones events dungeons and more we re all hoping for raids soon thanks to the game s huge success updated season 1 review i mean the game just gets better and better except for one thing the new descendant got hit by corporate greed she is higher priced than most other descendants and is incredibly difficult to unlock normally they did respond and decide that the next character release will return to normal the character itself is awesome and the seasonal event is a blast the new missions and cut scenes are memorable the battle pass still has mid cosmetics but they increased the value substantially i m looking forward to the rest of the season the developers sped up the season cycle just for us because we wanted new characters faster nexon said that they re getting their well deserved bonuses so i hope everyone is glad
