2018 fifty hours in and i ve yet to encounter any elements of pay to win beyond speeding up timers or unlocking characters or cosmetic fashion frame items there is absolutely no need to pay to advance the game lots of the mission types are skill based in any case so no amount of platinum in game currency will buy you success the game itself is a extremely solid third person shooter satisfying very think destiny with more stuff to do community is absolutely ace too vets will actively join you to help you get what you need and you ll need a lot metric ton of blueprints and weapons to try out also i have no idea just how many characters there are i thought street fighter had a large roster blown away by how much content is in a free game the gameplay loop will ultimately be what keeps you playing ps the developers have a rather good pedigree too
