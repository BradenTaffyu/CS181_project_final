to everyone reading all of the bad reviews i would just like to stop you and express my humble opinion this game is amazing i have spent countless hours 115 8 hrs on this game either trying to get stupid hard achievements or pissing off my friends by killing them this game isn t a cash grab i haven t spent an extra dime on this game and i ve collected around 188 different skins including the platinum puppy by just playing the game i do have to say though if you are interested in this game and are considering buying it force a friend to buy it with you by any means possible they might not be your friend for very long but it s worth it i would sell my friend for this game every day of the week
