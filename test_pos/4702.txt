2022 i m going to split my review of call of duty modern warfare ii into a single player and multiplayer section i ll start with the campaign the campaign was an enjoyable filler experience emphasis on filler for me and nothing more than that i felt like at times the campaign went from awesome to cringe awesome to cringe over and over again some of the missions were super cool e g recon by fire whilst others were quite cringe e g violence and timing this mission especially felt like something taken out of a bollywood film felt quite unnatural and out of place to be honest this year there was clearly a heavy emphasis on stealth like missions which personally fell in good taste but some might dislike that alone on the hardest difficulty and doing the achievement that requires you to not fire a gun was one of the toughest challenges i have had in a long time the biggest selling point for me must be the sheer attention to detail in things like level design the amsterdam level is absolutely gorgeous gun animations etc and my personal favourite the sound design the sound of the guns impact of the grenades flash bangs in this game is truly art the guns and explosives genuinely feel powerful and effective compared to other years where they might sound more toy like tl dr decent campaign at best nothing mesmerising that will stick with you forgettable but good filler experience a good bonus to the multiplayer it is worth adding that the game ran beautifully on my 3070 i5 11400 pc and throughout a 7 5 hour campaign i experienced around 3 crashes which in my eyes is not that bad given how games are these days just 3 crashes is considered polished now for the part everyone really buys call of duty for the multiplayer as far as level design goes i am on the fence some of the maps are quite good like al bagra fortress farm 18 and el asilo where others leave more to be desired visually speaking they are all gorgeous to look at but some of them play horribly and i am not a fan personally though this is of course subjective honestly there is not much to say about the multiplayer aspect of the game as of right now if you enjoyed modern warfare 2019 you will most likely enjoy this game too and get a good few hours of fun from this game
