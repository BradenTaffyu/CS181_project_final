2021 this is the best battle royale on the market in my opinion it s got this level of quality and polish that no other br does but that doesn t mean i love it in fact i kind of hate it i hate shooting shields all game and i swear some of the nerds that play this game are insane and i feel like i stand no chance unless i dump months of my life away playing this game which i m definitely not doing it s heavily focused on team play it s almost impossible to wipe a good squad solo your positioning and movement has to be on point playing this game if you run into two players at once with purple shields you re probably dead either play this game with friends and have great communication or try to get carried by insane players when you solo queue i don t think there is a great battle royale to play at the moment but if you were to play one i would recommend apex
