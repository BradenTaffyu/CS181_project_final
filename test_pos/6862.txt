2019 now is the perfect time to get black ops 3 mostly for zombies here s whybo4 zombies sucks okay it doesnt suck but it s missing the charm the all previous black ops games weapons variety is lackluster in bo4 but there s a good amount of weapons in bo3 don t like em mod the game so you can have bo1 weapons or bo2 weapons or mw weapons even halo weapons the revival of modded maps when mod tools were introduced we had alot of lazy challenge box maps that zombie youtubers just eat up cheese cube and octagonal ascension are a few culprits they arent the lazy ones but you get my point zombie chronicles existsother mods like a wario ware esque game8 player grief modand a plethora of other reasons as for multiplayer its sorta alive it s not as alive as other games like mw2 or bo2 but it still has enough players to get a match going even though it has exo movement it s executed perfectly as for singleplayer it s okay i only found real enjoyment in coop and nightmare mode the price is pretty expensive what i recommend is getting it off a keysite but buy all the dlc on here or humble or if it s on sale for 30 45 dollars it s still a good buy because now it comes with zombie chronicles black ops 3 is honestly a master piece of a game for zombies even though it has a soulless gobblegum system it s made with love and the same amount if not more is being put into the game by the players and modders pick it up asap
