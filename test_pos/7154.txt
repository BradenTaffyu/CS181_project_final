2015 personally i love the game but i have always loved cod since modern warfare people need to realize that it is launch weekend and not everything is going to be perfect about the game they also need to realize that the more feedback they get about the problems results in faster patching for them the zombies is great the multiplayer is great and i have yet to play the campaign from where it stands right now i would definitely recommend this game to people but seriously people let them try and fix things before you give a bad review about it it s only been 2 days
