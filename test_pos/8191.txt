2023 this game is a masterpiece i say that in the truest most genuine sense of the word this is the work of people who have absolutely mastered their craft and it shows masterpiece doesn t mean perfect but it s damn close are there bugs yes surprisingly few though are there balance issues sure will you get frustrated and curse the very gods when utter is thrown at you without warning absolutely is all of this a part of the totality of the experience that makes it so compelling you better believe it not only is the gameplay excellent but the mystery behind everything is captivating and the technical marvel that is this game s engine is absolutely unbelievable i still have no idea how the hell they managed to make a game capable of simulating so many millions of pixels with such ease in spite of the immense complexity of possible interactions even with the chunk system dividing the world up into manageable blocks and i first played on a now 11 year old pc without any serious performance issues barring some exceptional circumstances it s incredible one of the most emphatic themes of the entire game is that magic is powerful and mysterious but also extremely dangerous reckless use can and will quickly lead to your demise yet for those who do manage to successfully harness its abilities without self destruction it is entirely possible to become godlike and that s no exaggeration that said it comes at a high price and it s a difficult road to travel i normally don t like permadeath in games and i honestly do recommend playing at least at first with a quicksave utility since there s no native built in save system which is my one and only complaint that will allow you to learn things a bit easier and probably actually get through the whole main loop of the game but i can t really say i fault the game for going the roguelike route either and i recommend you refrain from backing up your save once you start exploring the deeper mysteries of the world trust me it really does enhance the experience unless of course your time is very limited then by all means savescum away without shame whatever it takes to experience this amazing world there are countless incredibly cryptic puzzles to solve here most of which i d never have managed to figure out on my own but thanks to folks who datamined and analyzed everything they could dig up which the developers seem to fully encourage it s possible to experience world altering cosmic mayhem firsthand you just might want to look up some guide videos unless you re the type who likes to really dig deep and experiment with very limited clues but even once you understand what to do actually managing to do it successfully is another matter entirely on top of all that there are dozens of high quality mods to further expand and customize the experience there s basically no reason i can think of to not recommend noita to anyone who likes combat experimentation creativity exploration deep lore extreme replay value or serious challenge it has everything and does all of it extremely well easily in my top 5 games of all time 10 10 without hesitation
