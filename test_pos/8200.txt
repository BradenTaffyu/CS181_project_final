it s the sort of game that let s me engage in excessive levels of power drunk madness for hours on end and then quickly humiliates me mid run when i get polymorphed and die immediately after the game is still being updated and getting new content updates the best part of the game has to be the wandcrafting once you understand how wands work the quest to create more powerful wands is ever present you don t know power until you create a wand that can crash your game just from a single click
