2014 when counter strike go came out it wasn t very good and the online servers was quite dead but after a year of updates the game have become really good i knew valve and the team behind cs wouldn t let the cs fans down counter strike go offers different gamemodes improved graphics and overall options a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons the competitive scene have grown and i think thats great unlike some other fps cs requires skill and training when the game came out you couldn t customize the weapons very much but now thats possible with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff cs go is really cheap compared to most competitors so im recommending it without doubt
