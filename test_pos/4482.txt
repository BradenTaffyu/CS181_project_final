2019 ah i ve played this game so much and lived in its world for so long i feel like a detailed review is not even needed anymore and instead would require only saying this was my second home for a really long time however number one f2p model in the industry this game features so many things i was honestly overwhelmed the first 20 hours vanilla wow didn t manage to make me feel like that with 70 spells macros in my action bars and the completely new thing back in 2004 the devs are working their butts off to make this the best game possible and it s all for free they also have regular streams with prizes people keep saying it s p2w but it s not using the store and the currency just shortens the grind but it also decreases the fun you get even if you spend your hard earned money to speed things up and get the best weapons you still won t be better than other players if you don t know how to play i won t go into the pros and cons as there are too many pros and very few cons mostly personal situational so i ll go a different route start playing this game you ll see most of its quirks and features in about 10 hours at first the design might be a bit weird if you re like me but after that you ll absolutely love it or you won t sometimes it can get confusing but the community is great so the chat is always your best friend digital extremes in my book ties with cd projekt red no doubt and the way they re evolving might get them to the no 1 spot that s it go play it now edit digital extremes in my book ties with cd projekt red i completely forgot about this bit well we can safely say that de is now my favorite name out there
