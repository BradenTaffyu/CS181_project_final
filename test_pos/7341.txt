the mtx are dumb just like in dmc5 and re it is what it is don t buy them you can get them all easily in game the performance is rough in the city but perfectly fine outside where you should be spending most of your time not great but hopefully gets fixed but the game itself is what i ve waited for since ddon got it s servers turned off it is dd1 but better in pretty much every way it has me hook line and sinker it is so bloody good if you are a dd1 fan and not hyper triggered by dumb capcom things you have to get this dragon s dogma 2 is finally here
