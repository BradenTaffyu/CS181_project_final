to say ca has had some troubling decision making is perhaps the understatement of the year however i do genuinely believe this game business aside is well worth it especially if you have the first 2 games already the diplomacy is a significant improvement with the ability to sell and buy cities being absolutely useful early on and into the mid game the races mostly are reasonably balanced with each other sorry kislev and ogres not you there is also a feature i consider significantly underrated and something i wish was in total war rome 2 and the like at times you can play co op with multiple people and all of your turns are done together huge quality of life improvement dlc wise champions of chaos are okay chaos dwarfs are a fantastic addition ogre kingdoms are at least fun if undercooked and shadows of change well i guess they went back and added some value probably should get these dlc on sale though it s a 4 stars out of 5 type deal with the major issues being largely business related but i have hundreds of hours in at this point so it s hard to say i haven t had fun modding community is fantastic highly recommend things like legendary characters and the old world for some added fun
