2023 this is my first fromsoftware game but not my last the world is expansive horizontally and vertically very few times is there a load screen as almost all of the world is one giant map given the size it is quite impressive the plot well you will need to be a sleuth online guide reader or completionist to really get what is going on i really just got the main plot but even that was over 90 hours i bought it slightly on sale which is great but any dark souls fans will get their monies worth out of it epic grand open world that is dark forboding and creepy not for everyone but as of this writing over 20 million copies so maybe it is for everyone you will die alot8 10
