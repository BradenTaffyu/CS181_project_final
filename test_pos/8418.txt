lies of p is by far the most beginner friendly and enjoyable souls like game i have played it s the only souls like game that has consistently drawn me back overall the game exudes a very pleasing aura in terms of design and aesthetics also the voice acting is superb update finally i finished the game and got all the endings after three playthroughs i saved the best ending for last the proper ending with the highest humanity and i have to say what a beautiful story t t this game feels like a mystery solving adventure every character has a story there are so many unique elements in the game i don t want to spoil too much but the combat alone is one of a kind very versatile giving you so much freedom to create any play style you like the map i loved it it s like a puzzle an intricately designed maze i had so much fun just exploring the voice acting is probably the best i ve ever encountered the record music and ost are gentle yet subtly full of emotions and memories to fully experience this amazing game try to invest in the story actually read the dialogue and memos which are brief but impactful in the end what a great game it held my attention even for an inconsistent player like me i can t recommend it enough and considering this is neowiz s first rpg game it exceeded my expectations and probably everyone else s thank you neowiz for this original and stunning game you definitely put a lot of effort into it and truly understand what makes a great game it was a fun ride and i can t wait for the sequel
