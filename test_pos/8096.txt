2023 noita is one of the best games i ve ever played at its core noita is a roguelite with falling sand style physics simulation you randomly acquire spells and put them together in wands with random stats while managing your health gold and inventory space to accumulate strength the wand building is deep and satisfying in a way beyond most other games i ve ever played spells have not just different damage speed and elemental effects but also statistical alterations and complex hidden interactions and these interactions lead to depth of play that never seems to stop growing if that sounds overwhelming don t worry as it simply gives you power from knowledge and many different ways to achieve your goals you can make an all powerful death wand with 26 spells if you want or you can use just 5 7 pieces for a different effect sometimes just as powerful as the 26 er depending on your pieces the world of noita is beautiful and brutal the simulated world means that every grain of sand drop of mystical potion puff of gas and pixel of metal is a potential obstacle or potential resource awareness is key as every biome has something that can turn what feels like an untouchable won run into instant death and that doesn t just mean the enemies locales and their inhabitants are strange often hostile and present a wide variety of both threats and boons don t be discouraged if you get vaporized early on as every bit of knowledge brings you power as you learn to exploit the world while avoiding death the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere for this environment sometimes psychedelic sometimes haunting sometimes frenetic and energetic always appropriate to every threat and safe place and amazing to listen to it s hard to talk more about noita without ruining the experience so all i ll say is that the game offers much more than it appears more than enough to justify the 300 hours i ve spent on it at the time of writing this review more than enough to justify the first sentence in this review the game captures witchcraft and mysticism in a way that no other game i ve ever played has by not only giving you the fruits of the arcane art but also the journey to obtaining those fruits every bit of the game makes you feel like a witch from the highs to the lows from the triumphs to the terrors from the power to the helplessness from the euphoria of knowledge to the obfuscation of mysteries seemingly beyond your comprehension it s incredible buy it
