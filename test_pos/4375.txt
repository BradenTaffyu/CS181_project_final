2017 at first you think this game is epic and cool all the exotic features like archwing parkour and different weapons and warframes are just so good then you start to become better at the game and explore all the features like raids fissure runs and sorties suddenly a mastery rank 23 comes and join your game mr 23 is max level currently you see him with a prime waframe prime weapons an elite kavat pet and extremely good looking cosmetics you make it your life goal to become just like the player you grind for those prime stuff by repeatedly playing missions that drop relics which can be opened to unlock primed parts here is when rng comes and gives you terminal cancer 1 your chances of getting that exact relic that you want usually isnt too high making you repeat the mission a couple of times before you get 1 2 relics drop 5 prime parts and usually you try to go for the rarest part it will take a couple relic runs to drop the rarest part with the rng now that you have grinded for those parts you can now finally build your cool akbronco prime but wait there s more you realize your akbronco prime sucks and you need to buff it with mods you can equip mods on to your weapon and boost its power significantly mods drain slots and have polarities matching polarities will reduce the drain allowing you to put more mods on the weapon now there is this wonderful thing called forma which lets you alter the polarity to reduce drain but how do you use it simple you level your weapon to the max 30 which would take around 1 2 hours then forma it and reset it to level 0 again now do this a couple times for all the weapons and warframes you have assuming you are slow like me and take 2 hours to max a weapon and you forma each one 3 times and you have 15 weapons to forma 2x3 66x15 90there goes 90 hours of my life but wait there is like over 100 weapons in the game maybe even 200 what about the warframes which take twice as long to level and needs like 5 formas what about the grind for the 50 relics that you opened just to get a trinity prime chassis trash what about selling your good prime parts to get platinum and buy cosmetics if you read this far you could ve already went to akkad and leveled your hydroid so i am proud to say that i ve wasted hours on a game and i am still not even half way to being good if you want to be good at the game you gotta have like 2k hours but hey at least it looks cool right i thinkcondensed review mad grind looks cool give it a try cool co op experience
