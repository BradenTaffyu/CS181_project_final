2021 tldr a good game but better with friends pros relatively easy to pick up and learn phenomenal sound design every game is unique you can play your own style and with the character of your choosing ranging from 25 survivors and an equal amount of killers with their own unique perks extremely fun with friends honestly it s probably better to play this game with friends because you know who they are and you know how they play instead of getting people you ve never met who could be hiding in a locker the entire reason for unknown reasons you do you boo cosmetics and customisation now i m not saying you can make claudette suddenly light skin but you can have her running around in a bright pink shirt with a pride charm on her pants it has crossplay cons skewed matchmaking honestly the community can be pretty toxic killers can and do camp basically ruining the whole point of the game but you play however you want if you wanna camp then camp the skillchecks i personally find to be annoying and tedious for the sake of being tedious especially with how damn important they are in this game for fixing objectives don t get me wrong they re pretty easy once you learn them i just don t personally see the necessity for it to be the way it currently is this genuinely might be a deal breaker for some people but there is a battlepass style progression for cosmetics a couple extras i wanted to add when you originally buy the base game it ll only come with 5 survivors and 3 killers that you can play this does not mean that you cannot play against and with the other killers survivors in a match but it does mean that in order to play them yourself you ll need to be the corresponding dlc it s also gonna take you some time to get used to the game in itself the sound design how different killers and survivor perks work how the game plays that s okay just take your time and learn at your own pace players can be easily tiltable this game deters away those people pretty fast killers put up with survivors taunting them constantly and vice versa strong mental is gonna be pretty important to play this game bloodpoints are earned based on how well you do in the game you ll always earn them the more you play but the amount you earn is dependant on how well you do throughout your games this could be deterring for new players who haven t learnt the system yet and want to progress faster as they feel they re behind the curve perks wise after being matched with people who play the game frequently
