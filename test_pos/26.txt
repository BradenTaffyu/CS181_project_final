after beating the game twice and seeing both endings i can finally give it my personal assessment this review contains spoilers and a considerable amount of bias so take it with a grain of salt graphic art directionit s an easy 9 or even 10 for me with a triple a budget pair with ue5 the graphical fidelity is impressive while some have pointed out that stock assets are used to paint the environment i honestly don t mind that much as long as they blend in well chapters 1 to 3 probably have the most distinguished biomes and stunning architecture iirc the team 3d mapped a bunch of historical buildings and reconstructed them in game this approach is a breath of fresh air after playing western aaa games for so many years the animated mini series from each chapter is also surprisingly well made and unexpected it gives the game a such unique character in terms of art direction plot storytellingfor those who have never read the classic journey to the west the plot might seem puzzling and confusing i don t blame you the narrative is scattered all over the place and each chapter could be its own standalone story for those who actually read the classic novel the plot is just as baffling as everyone else in fact the world setting is only partially based on the original work black myth s team has taken creative liberties to reinterpret journey to the west based on another modern novel named wu kong and their previous journey to the west mmo the tone is much darker the writing is edgier and the underlying message is up to you to interpret i only hope they can come up with a more coherent plot that stitches all the chapters together combat gameplayfor this section i might need to break it into two parts the monkey itself and the rest of the mobs the destined one has a very limited move set some weapons have their own variants added to the basic attack but that s about all you get the combat mechanic is relatively shallow and gets repetitive fast there are some builds that synergize certain spirits with your gears but the variety is still lackluster on the contrary i much prefer the enemy diversity although some re skins exist most still have their own move set and animation there are a total of 55 mini bosses and 26 bosses which brings the total to 81 this odd number may not be apparent to some but in the jttw novel this is the exact number of tribulations they must endure to retrieve the scriptures interestingly 81 is also the number of achievements on the pc end i m absolutely fond of the last fight with wukong with erlang coming in a close second everyone and their mother has watched the 86 jttw tv series in china and the amount of love and homage they put into the final battle is off the charts this battle alone carries the entire chapter 6 considering how bland the level design is otherwise i couldn t think of a better boss fight in recent years yes as i said before i m incredibly biased on this the nostalgia hits differently overallin its current state i give it an 8 5 it is an excellent entry as their first aaa title although it has its flaws a good game doesn t necessarily excel in every single aspect the storytelling could be better because it doesn t complement how great the art direction is at the same time if they intend to create a semi boss rush arpg i hope they can iron out the invisible walls in both level design and during combat along with more in depth combat mechanics to ensure both elements complement each other
