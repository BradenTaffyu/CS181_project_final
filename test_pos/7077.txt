2015 well this my is first proper review so bear with me note i said that there are no original perks in the zombies mode that is an error on my part as i didn t play the map enough at the time to find them they are part of the game when i was reading up the reviews for this game i was very concerned about buying it myself due to the excessive amount of negative reviews left by people however i do believe in trying out for myself instead of going off other people s words i m not an extreme fan of cod but i have so far enjoyed all of the games released by treyach excuse the spelling so i thought why not give it a go initially the game seemed normal no issues on the menu or setup all runs as it should after starting up a private match in multiplayer to test it out i did run into a few minor issues now i m not someone who complains about a game if i can t run it on ultra high realistic settings so the fact that the game for me lagged when i had it on normal did not bother me my computer is a fairly decent one amd eight core processor gtx770 and 8gb of ram but i still had to turn down everything to low settings but like i said this is a minor point for me in regards to bugs and issues my game does every now and then drop to 30fps for a couple of seconds but this isn t very often pretty much all of the time it runs nicely at 65 frame give or take a couple i only encountered two bugs so far that caused me to get a little annoyed however they only happened once and since then they never repeated the first was getting a completely white screen when trying out the zombies mode for the first time i was still able to access the menu so i quit the match and after trying again it worked as it intended the second one was recieving an in game error code whilst trying to access one ability on the campaign mode can t remember the code and it caused my game to run at 1 2fps and be unplayable i promptly quit and restarted it and it never appeared again so far overall the bugs are not bothering me that much gameplay wise i find it quite enjoyable from the things i heard about advanced and ghosts this is much better and more balanced i don t feel like there is an extremely overpowered weapon or class just yet i haven t encountered anything rage worthy and the gameplay feels even the added extra of jump boosting and wall running i feel has been done just right and the maps are done decently certainly a fast paced game for sure zombie though did annoy me a bit there s only one map on the normal edition i can t say much about the actual map that is there as i only played it once successfully it is a nice challenge though and is quite big it does take elements of that one alkatraz map i can t remember it exactly one thing i done like personally is that fact that there are no normal perk machines as they are replaced by a gum all machine that contains all of the chosen perks being able to choose your perks is also quite nice and i guess it makes up a little bit for removing the single separate machines overall unless you are dead set for ultra graphics and 120 fps and you have a mid range computer i would say wait until they optimize it a bit more if you don t really care about those things and want to enjoy it in a casual experience then i don t see why you wouldn t like it bear in mind this is my own opinion of a more casual player than competitive
