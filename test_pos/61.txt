after 20 something hours in the game i think i finally have a better grasp on what the games about now if you want the tldr of it then i d say the game is worth picking up whilst the game certainly has its quirks it also has really solid gameplay amazing graphics and a surprisingly compelling story line for those willing to look deeper into the game i d say those reasons make the game worth trying if nothing else for those interested in hearing me ramble for a bit i d say that this game really wasn t anything that i expected it to be someone likened it to chinese god of war and i ll admit i can understand why the levelling system and limited weapons options are very reminiscent of god of war 2018 with attacks and movies being very weighty and full of depth personally i initially thought of game like lies of p with its linear map design and story chapters but the longer i ve played this the more i ve realised that black myth wukong is a game that subverts expectations in the beginning i was somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge that enemies presented i thought that the enemies died too quickly and that you had way too much stamina to really strategize with your moves so combat felt button mashy with no real depth since you could easily dodge everything like it wasn t as if you d run of stamina anyway and this made the otherwise cool levelling system useless since i already felt overpowered then i encountered wandering wight the second mini boss and realised that you needed to have that much stamina otherwise you can t even participate in the battles much less win then i felt that the game just had too many boss battles so much so that with how linear the game was it felt like it was a boss rush game with very little to explore or lore to encounter just boss battle then cutscene a then further boss battles but this couldn t be further from the case while the game has a strong focus on boss battles it also has many storylines quests even hidden lore cutscenes and entirely new maps to explore for anyone interested in looking the thing is though the game is more than happy to have you miss these huge bits of content the lack of an in game map and the many invisible walls also make it a little challenging to notice initially but when you do you realise there is a lot more to the game than initially seems with content far more engaging than you d have thought the game subverts these expectations over and over until you start wondering if the flaw you notice in the game is really a flaw or if it s something that s been addressed and you just haven t gotten far enough or looked deeply enough for it to be resolved this is the reason that i thought i had to play for a bit before i could comment on it and after so many hours i think i get finally get it i can honestly recommend this as a game worth trying and many only real complaints with it are the often obnoxious invisible walls and the lack of a player hub of some sort that s unanimously safe that and the sharpening feature on fsr that makes the images look so much worse but overall game of the year
