2022 i mean its exactly what it says on the tin its cod and its a very safe game the weapons feel pretty good to use games are fast paced and more importantly well paced there is a decent amount of content with the regular game modes on offer then you have groundwar invasion etc the maps are well meh not a lot to say again they re safe none of the maps have had me amazed and none have had me playing in disgust either the game seems pretty well optimised as well from my perspective i have an rtx 2080ti and the game runs smoothly at 60fps on high settings and in 9hrs of playtime it has only crashed on me once however few issues game does need better balancing most guns kill way to quickly the game needs hardcore introducing and that should have been there from the start also needs better matchmaking or a better way of dividing matchmaking i play these games pretty casual now i m not interested in the competitive scene whatsoever that divide needs to exist for people who want to play casual and competitively or with friends or whatever is it worth 60 probably not but how many aaa titles are these days just the market we re in unfortunately wait till the christmas sale and then buy it then overall though its safe nothing groundbreaking and it never will be but it is also fun 3 5
