2021 i have 0 hours on steam because i ve played over 900 hours on origin and let me just tell you that i personally think this is the greatest battle royale game ever created it blends the perfect mix of gunplay communication and mobility to create an almost perfect game there are some kinks for new players which i assume a lot of the people reading this review are going to be are currently the issue with smurf accounts is rampant and it can be a very difficult experience getting used to the game and its combat when level 450 wraith mains create a new account and then dunk on the newbies with a wingman if you stick with the game and reach level 10 or 20 this becomes less of a problem as many smurf accounts are used a few times to troll or have fun without reaching higher levels if you even consider playing ranked expect a massive amount of cheating respawn has not fixed the issue of hacked clients and very often you see players who have hundreds of kills still playing fine in ranked lobbies it is currently an extremely toxic and impossible environment to play not mentioning the many glitches and bugs that plague it and i really hope respawn takes the time to fix those issues in the next ranked season as is customary with electronic arts they do enjoy getting consumers to pay as much as possible and recently were exposed for putting certain cosmetics with unmatching sets in the store even though the teasers for the new items showed said items together in a uniform set this is only a big deal if you ever really consider putting money into the game the only benefit to using the in game store is cosmetics and by playing regularly you can earn a lot of rare and legendary items yourself these are either recent or temporary problems however and the benefits and pros of this game far outweigh the cons if you have been looking for a battle royale that is unique in its own sense and will take you away from the endless spam of fortnite pubg warzone and other popular brs this game is absolutely for you please give apex a try i am almost certain you will not regret it
