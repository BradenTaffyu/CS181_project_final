2022 for context i played the campaign to finish on veteran and have played a few hours of mp overall graphics took a very nice leap forward character movement is smooth and fluid gun animations are somewhat realistic but the mechanics are great finding balance on different weapon platforms so far audio is outstanding again like mw 2019 campaign excellent imo is not better than the first mw campaign 2007 with some of those classic and reminiscent missions but it is good i have played every cod campaign and this is up there with some of the best this is also the first one where i felt like i had to watch the cut scenes very movie like and very cool they did an excellent job dropping them in there to piece the missions together and to make you feel really in and part of the story i will say veteran felt like the easiest its been on any campaign thus far don t know if i magically am smarter and better doubt it or they made things a tad easier more likely verdict play it watch the cut scenes enjoy the story you re being told you wont be disappointed multiplayer great very fun to play much different that mw 2019 so do not buy this with the expectation that it is the same or built upon this game went for a slower pace and more realistic feel read that again i personally love it i enjoy mil sims not this that is one but cod moved in that direction ever so slightly what do i mean by that the basics movement speed is slower ive always hated how for a majority of cod s movement speed reigned king oh your 15 years old and had 25 monsters energies in 2 hours awesome you can move around the map at the speed of light shredding players with your sub machine gun or melee weapon not in this cod it stops here grenades and snipers if you enjoy sniping youll be happy to hear that cod listened to the msga crowd make sniping great again 95 of the time its a 1 hit kill from what ive experienced grenades are now pretty useful and more realistic where you can get a decent amount of kills per match throwing them in hot lanes ones with a lot of enemy traffic maps so far so good they feel bigger and more complex that means more places to hide a campers dream but more places to surprise your enemy it feels weird being able to vault more things and do more climbing in this cod but its a nice change of pace will you use it more often to regular gameplay no probably not but it doesn t take away from the experience at all it only further adds to the realism cod mw2 is going for gunsmith absolutely amazing the best part of the the multiplayer experience so far there feels like an endless amount of attachments their basically is you start with the base gun in a weapons family tree for instance once the m4 assault rifle is leveled up enough you unlock a new marksmen rife and a new lmg you use these enough you unlock a new short smg m4 the honey badger for those who know and the finally the m16 this is a new spin on things much different then the hard unlock at x y z level up for the first time ever you are able to tweak the bonus s an attachment gives you this tuning tool is unlocked when a weapon level is maxed out this essentially provides infinite combinations of any given weapon don t like the ads lets boost it dont like how inaccurate it is we can fix that a very very big leap forward in cod weapon customization do i think some weapons will be cracked this way yes it always happens lets see what creative insane combos the community comes up with this time verdict real cod multiplayer is back baby none of this vanguard or black ops garbage its different its fun and its tuned more to your ability to get on target and hit accurate shots may the better gun fighter win is motto here if you are looking to dominate because you have your sensitivity turned all the way up and 18 red bulls in the system sorry this cod has essentially nerfed you final word buy this cod its the best in years and so far better than mw 2019 for a multitude of reasons
