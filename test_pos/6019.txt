2020 m1 simulator jokes aside you can just begin a chase with the killer if you are survivor but this game is rather buggy and the community is made up of friendly opponents or entitled players though you can always just turn the endgame chat off this game is like a coin it has two sides to it on one side it s an actually enjoyable games disregarding the bugs and hitboxes on the other side really boring if all you re doing is holding m1 as a survivor and the game s community can be just like other games absolutely horrible i personally love this game and i can t recommend it enough if you don t mind bugs and toxic communities
