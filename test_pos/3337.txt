2015 this very well could be the best game ever made i m surprised to see a mostly positive rating as i can t imagine anyone giving this game a negitive rating unless they are one of the poor sod s that have the windows install issue to me the game plays like a movie that i am part of it s funny and exciting and at the same time very challenging it s the total package i must note that i have the game for ps4 and the pc version is vastly superior in every way
