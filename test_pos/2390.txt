product received for free apex legends is a game i have played for 4 years and i have definitely seen its ups and downs as time passed i would personally recommend this game not just because it is fun but because it has its own unique characteristics in comparison to other battle royale games like cod warzone and fortnite you can certainly look up many things about this game but i believe that it is most likely guaranteed you will find a legend in the roster that suits you best there is also a great amount of customization in this game which can be very expensive if you choose to spend money on this game comparable to the likes of the games i mentioned prior with extra possessions like your tailored banner the last thing i will say before i review this game critically is that it may be tough for new players though if you research ways to get better online you will get through it now since we have sung its praises with many more that i did not mention we must now look at what apex does not get right or what it could fix to do better hacking is currently rampant in apex especially in the competitive mode as you move up the ranks this has been a problem for a very long time possibly dating back to season 2 when i started playing when i was on console so at that time hacking was barely a concern or even not a concern at all while when i switched to pc in season 3 i personally started seeing cheaters in game as soon as season 5 it also relates to the large incident that happened in algs recently where 2 players genburten and imperialhal had their game hijacked giving them esp with full hitboxes health and player names along with bullet not aim locking aimbot hacking is the only concern i will describe in this review because it has been recent and is a genuine concern and has been for a long time in conclusion while apex has many great qualities i mentioned there are some concerns that do not have to do with how the game is intended to be played i would personally give the game an 8 9 10 because despite its shortcomings it is unique it can be tailored and most of all it is great but its shortcomings hinder me from giving it a 9 10 amazing opinions can differ widely on how good or bad this game is depending on who you ask so i am not expecting you to 100 believe in my opinion and all i ask of you is that you at the very least consider it
