2022 elden ring is a fantastic open world souls game with amazing design bosses and the environment itself but what makes this game truly the best is there are cats in this game you can encounter multiple cats in various areas find items related to cats and the best part is that cats are part of the lore which is why i consider this game to be the best cat game let s hope there will be even more cats in the dlc 3
