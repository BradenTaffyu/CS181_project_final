2020 crossing the street in gta online is like walking through iraq in 2004 you could be driving around and you ll get orbital cannoned for no reason if you don t like flying bikes and cars that shoot accurate homing missiles don t get it game is filled with griefers and k d hunters that have nothing to do in life but to shoot down your cargo for no reason it s filled with connection problems as well however if you re buying for the story the story is amazing don t get me wrong online can be fun too just 40 of the time
