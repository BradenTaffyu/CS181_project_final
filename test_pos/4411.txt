2017 i wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of warframe as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours for those who are new to the game so they don t goof up as much as i did first off the game will take up space on your computer so this isn t for the weak ones that crash easily either and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this second this game is not something you can play for 8 hours straight a day unless you have a clear objective of what it is you re gonna do when playing be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards missions farming resources and prime items etc then you will get bored easily i say this because of the hours i ve wasted in indecision of what it is i wanted to do and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on third be prepared to grind the out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up you will not get far simply blitzing through each mission and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous that said this leads me to my next point fourth this is a genuine f2p and although real currency can not will be used it is not necessary to advance at all using platinum this is the currency you do exchange your real money into is completely optional and there are multiple tips i ll give on the use of it for newcomers 1 spending platinum is optional2 don t use it on frivolous things like credits the game s other currency that you can earn in any mission or resources as it is not worth it in value3 save it for big purchases like colours hard to obtain warframes or accessories trust me you ll want to be stingy4 there are ways of gaining plat without spending real money but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners these items are called prime items and hold onto as many as possible you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them trade them as prime junk with other items to gain platinum just be patient when looking for partners finally each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use buttons 1 4 on your keyboard activate them during missions it took me ages to realise they were even there so i figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you its entirely up to you on how you play this and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting or hell for the recovering ones anyway in short good luck grinding the out of this game
