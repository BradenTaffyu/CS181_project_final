2022 i believe it labels itself as a more melee centered battle royale but i would say it plays more like a fighting game battle royale with its build in rock paper scissors type melee combat this game has a ton of little technical things to discover and slowly add to your play style if you choose to highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a somewhat technical fighting game in a battle royale setting bufftarka buffvalda
