2023 edit obviously this review was complaining about a lot of issues around the release of shadows of change ca seem to be making a lot of steps to address these issues especially their pricing and fixing issues features so kudos to them for that i ll leave the review as is because it s a positive review anyway but it s also a reminder that they might screw everything up again if they get complacent all these points still stand for games workshop however an incredibly accurate representation of the tabletop game if you want the games workshop experience in a video game nothing beats it over priced check riddled with balance issues check filled with technical issues and gameplay features that are clunky or don t really work well check devs don t really bother trying to fix them and if they do it just breaks other things double check and if you complain about these things the people in charge just ignore you and keep doing it anyway big ole check really its impressive how committed ca are to emulating the warhammer experience
