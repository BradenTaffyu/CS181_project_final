2016 since i m writing this review 6 min after the release i m going to be original and say what i think about the beta my expectations for this game and after playing the reality aka release tldr a very fun but buggy online multiplayer focused horror game with a very good progression system just buy it beta very buggy some times even made me want to punch the monitor cheaters i really liked the bloodweb system i didn t like the fact that the hunter could grab you if you try to save your friends on the hook even at full health which makes so that it s very very risky to unhook a friend when playing a hunter that placed a trap in the middle so you cant save without getting trapped and that is camping the hooked survivor i like that vaulting is a high risk high reward thing since you can get grabbed from doing it but if you master vaulting to juke the killer it becomes kinda abusable i hated that i couldn t invite friends to ranked matches so that i could master survivor with them it would take forever to find each other in a lobby the juke shacks were only abusable for the bad hunters who didn t trap the windows liked the flashlight at first but then never used due to the fact that there s no indicator that the killer was blind and he could move so sometimes you can t tell the map was only decent with perks but overall one of the worst items the toolbox was in someways overpowered if you mannaged to take all the hooks but good killers mannage to get you on the basement anyway the medkit is great for someone whos very good at juking and want to either focus on saving survivors or distracting the killer while others get the generators i liked the hatch it s an interesting feature but the key item is overpowered on the right hands if it doesn t glitch on the map and spawns if wasn t for the beta the game would die because streamers and youtubers gave that much exposure overall a good but buggy beta it actually made me buy the game because i almost clocked 30 hours in the beta expecations killers way better than the others the different maps like cornfield will be gamechangers for each killer overpowered perks add ons and offerings for both killers and survivors the key will be abusable with add ons that prevent it from losing the item the cornfield map will either be very good or very bad to the survivors the invite friend system won t be there on release releasing only 1 week after which sucks based on what the devs said the bloodweb system is what will keep this game alive with the infinite ways to get new perks items and add ons reality so after 2 hours of playing heres what i think of the release it still has a lot a bugs but some of them were fixed the lobby bugs haven t been fixed tho which is what pissed me off the most there are gamebreaking glitches tho like being stuck in a closet and slowly dying without being able to be saved or grabbed so that you could otherwise being able to wiggle away which means u gotta wait the longest way to lose without a chance to get away the maps are pretty great i definitely prefer them over the beta ones maps are gamechanging to killers like hillbilly where he gets advantage on maps with a big area without objects to interrupt his charge like the cornfield map the wraith feels weaker than the other killers you can see his outline of invisibility clearly and from far away which makes his ability not amazing haven t died yet to him and he s the most played killer atm the hillbilly is great on the right hands but can be easly countered by objects the trapper is still good to camp on the hook if he places his trap on the proper spot so that the other survivors will step on it if trying unhook their teammate it will be very hard to get your friend unhooked unless with 2 survivors trying to unhook one to distract the killer the other to disarm and unhook unless the killer gets away there s still no invite to ranked system which is problably only releasing next week cmon guys how am i supposed to find one of my friends on a lobby with 17k people playing the juke shacks as expected were nerfed which tbh i understand why because it would be a very hard time to wraith and hillbilly the toolbox was properly nerfed now you can only disarm about 2 hooks and that s it no more cheesing strats the medkit was nerfed aswell allowing you to only be able to heal yourself once unless you have addons that let you do it more than once tho it s still one of the best items the flashlight i haven t used it yet but from what i see from streams it appears to still not have an indicator of when the killer is blinded which means i won t use it the hatchet has new spawn locations problably because it kept glitching on the beta version and not spawning the rank system is still 20 ranks which i expected to be increased due to the significant level cap increase vaulting seems a little bit slower which i can understand why but it s still very abusable infinite bloodweb system hell yeah will write more when i play more i can see how the game improved and that the developers are actually listening to the community hoping to see what they come up with in the future even if i didn t play a single hour after the release i would consider the time i spent in the beta playing worth the price i paid for if you re looking for a unique game where you can play as a killer like in the horror movies and chasing down your friends and watch them die then this game is for you if you re looking for a competitive game where you want to be the best killer ever existed or the best survivor then this game is for you aswell the infinite bloodweb reward system will simply make you keep playing this for a long long time recommended ofc
