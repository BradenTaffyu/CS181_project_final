2021 it s space ninjas performing flashy gymnastics and gaudy movements who would say no to that on top of that the community is helpful and friendly on pc you ll always find pugs to run missions with and other players will not care if you are mr1 player level or if you are using the initial default frame class there s almost no way to be a hindrance when grouping up with other randoms unless you go afk or something because the missions are quick and straightforward the game respects your time and will not demand your attention or money any more than what you are willing to give you will not miss out on new content or become so far behind that players wouldn t want to group up with you unlike other popular games in the genre fear of missing out is not a common theme here all content past and present is included for free and can be obtained in game at your own leisure while the grind is long and endless you can make meaningful progress whether you play for 15 minutes or 10 hours where other games demand that you keep playing or spend cash to have the slightest chance of witnessing the rest of the game warframe has no such tradeoffs and playing it in short bursts at your own pace is perfectly fine regardless of rank or level the devs a bunch of goofy canadians are in constant communication with the players they stream several times a week with nice loot drops host drunk dev streams every couple of months with no shortage of lewd jokes and innuendos and are actually likable and funny there are two main things setting this game back and limiting its full potential the omission of competitive pvp to cater to the hardcore audience lack of cross save functionalityalas there s no clear confirmation whether the devs will eventually make those things happen or not overall warframe is a great example of how to do f2p right
