2019 okay i m gonna go in between everyone this game is not bad the only issue is the cheaters since the game became free cheaters have populated it the main thing to get ride of cheaters is your trust factor don t spam report or report at all even if they are cheating because a lot of them won t get banned and it ll flag you as a false reporter don t be toxic don t get kicked or leave games do not have a brand new steam accountdon t play mirage or overpass stick to the less played maps like nuke these maps are cheater heaven or hell if you follow those guidelines you re trust factor will increase over time once you are out of low trust factor you will maybe only run into a cheater 1 time out of 20 30 games
