it feels like a souls game without being a souls game and i love the idea behind it i played this game blind for my stream and i kept getting hit with some existential questions that had me questioning a lot of things real time this is a fantastic game and i can t wait for the developers to make more games like this they nailed the fromsoft atmosphere and gameplay and added onto it the customization for gameplay is unreal and they reward the people who go above and beyond handsomely i have recommended to friends and will do so time and time again
