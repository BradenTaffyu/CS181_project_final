2020 this game is exceedingly hard for me to review properly but i m going to take a stab at it firstly i recommended this game because i love this game it has the right amount of challenge can be played at whatever pace you feel like and when you get that itch to go exploring well this game s got that covered too i personally have taken on the challenge of becoming consistent at the game having held the early access world record for most consecutive wins with 11 and i did it by doing only 11 orb runs but know before getting into it that there are some clear downsides to noita especially with the 1 0 release that i would like to speak to first these changes made it very difficult for a casual player to get into the world of noita unfortunately however if you are seeking out a challenge noita is definitely for you my main point of contention is that 1 0 added forced randomized starting loadouts previously they were opt in by way of doing the daily instead of a normal game that sometimes give you different spells and a different flask to work with these cause needless suffering for new players for 3 reasons 1 you can get a primary wand with a single spitter bolt on it this single spitter bolt wand will have low range poor accuracy and poor speed and can leave players vulnerable to enemy attacks even veterans can become overwhelmed if they suddenly find themselves surrounded by enemies but new players are especially susceptible because they won t know what the correct enemy prioritization is resulting in heavy damage or death there are other bad primary wands as well but the spitter bolt is the worst and my hope is that spitter bolt and anything with short range really gets removed from the initial primary wand pool great alternatives are spark bolt bouncing burst summon arrow or magic arrow 2 you can get a secondary wand with no explosives on it while a rain cloud has its use see the next point the ability to get out of potential soft locked situations with an explosion is invaluable for new players and not having an explosive spell to do so hurts new player progression 3 you can get a random flask this is the most inexplicable decision to me because water is exceedingly valuable at all levels of play it can be used to put out fires neutralize toxic sludge make the player not take fire damage while stained with water and kill one of the more challenging first zone enemies the stendari my recommendation is to ditch whatever flask it gives you when you start even if beneficial and replace it immediately with water water can be found to the left of start under the tree you may have to dig and you may not have the tools necessary to do it but sometimes it s free to the right if you re willing to climb the mountain with an appropriate explosive in the wall ie anything but a bomb and find the lake or if you start with the rain cloud wand honestly it is my opinion that nolla should revert this change and make it opt in for the daily only or even enable it as an option for full runs why i find this important enough to bring up first is because there s literally a whole world of things to explore and learn about this game to have to also deal with the frustrations of a randomized and sometimes underwhelming starting loadout players are going to have their hands full tackling every challenge this game throws at it and as you get deeper into the game those challenges grow bigger and more difficult and that is what i love about this game this game pulls no punches you will get shot by the shotgunner repeatedly you will die to enemies with a freeze wand or a nuke wand or machine gun concentrated light wand you will kill yourself experimenting with wand building you will find enemies you have absolutely no idea what they do even after the 50th or 100th time you kill them because darn it that enemy is going to die before you find out what kind of terror it will inflict on you you will be running about panicked or scared because you know you can t deal with that one particular enemy and now you re running headlong into a bunch of other enemies and well game over there s a reason win streaks in this game are hard to come by and that s because the game is hard it makes you stop and think about what you re about to do is going down this hallway without checking above and below a safe bet is there a propane tank lurking in the snow you re about to dig in that you can t see is that underwater chest going to have a thunderstone did i just hear ukko or is that the wind often second guessing yourself and staying as safe as possible is the key to victory in noita if you re a speedrunning type noita has got you covered runs of this game can be as short as 2 minutes and involve absolute chaos tight dodges teleporting blindly into new territory and trying to find that one boss killing wand to finish the game as quickly as possible if you re an exploration type ignore the usual seven zones and explore the world around you find out what s at the bottom of the pit to the right of the lava lake what s outside to the left of the tree or to the right of the mountain journey into the sky or fight your way beneath the temple of the art to see what my lurk there traverse impossibly thick walls on either side of the map and see what might be on the other side fight optional bosses with unique mechanics and rewards discover strange quest items and try to figure out what to do with them learn the secrets of alchemy and be blessed with endless health and wealth if you re a completionist type you ll be interested in what s at the top of the tree pillars of meta progress that grow as you unlock more endings more spells and more challenges i myself plan on doing a ng 28 33 orb run at some point i expect that run to take weeks and to think that one drop of polymorphine can end that run is a scary but exciting prospect that will keep me on my toes the entire time if you re a mad scientist type wand building is where it s at there are so many spells with so many spell combinations in the game that you will be hard pressed to get a win with the same wand twice sure there are repeating themes homing mist wand trigger chainsaw wands speedy bouncing burst wands but in the end you get to craft your own tools of destruction from what you find in the game and that s one of the most rewarding things about this game so overall my recommendation for new players is to expect the game to be challenging and hard if you re going into this blind you are going to die quite possibly hundreds of times before you get a win if this is not your style this game may not be for you but if you re willing to learn everything the game has to offer you will be rewarded with a rich world of mystery worth exploring satisfying wands of mass destruction fulfilling victories against challenging bosses and the thrill of winning the game on your terms that is in between bouts of stepping in polymorphine and getting one shot best of luck noidat
