2017 i played this game when it was in closed beta years ago and it was good but a bit repetitive i ve opened it yet again after years few months ago and omg the game is insanely good i ve never seen a lore and quality this high in a cooperative mmo some of the quest the second dream and the war within are some of the best quests you can have in an online coop game 10 10 totally suggested
