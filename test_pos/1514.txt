2023 this is a really good game the only real issue that is setting people off is money yes the game is basically tw wh2 updated a bit and expanded yes the dlcs are shameless cash grabs yes yes yes all true but put things in context i paid about 100 including the game dlc and miscellaneous whatnot for a game that i spent 980 hours playing and mostly enjoying thoroughly that s about 0 10 an hour it s hard to feel ripped off at 0 10 an hour though i m still not going to buy that last dlc
