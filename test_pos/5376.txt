2021 8 10 rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter but that doesn t mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good whats not whats good most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added more on that topic soon the game rewards map familiarity some maps can have destructible floors walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own speaking of which custom games this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you re about to get yourself into this season free dlc finally a decent shooter that doesn t seem like all the devs want is money yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like pay to win but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season there are 4 season through the year so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them better each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys at least from what the data miners have found but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want all the cosmetic for the event in question this game heavily requires communication and strategy every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others one places bear traps that downs enemies another has a infra red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all there is an operator for everyone you like being slow and able to take some damage we have that you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots you like being faster than god itself play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her gadget is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls or how about a nice mix you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy s gadgets cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team or you may play as frost the bear trap operator there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist the devs are also very quick to fix major bugs in game but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community whats bad there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long this game has a high learning curve headshots are instakills sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere so get that aim up dude this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs i hope my review of rainbow six siege helped you out somehow if you would like to learn this game please add me on here i can tutor you to be a better player also as a last note here when playing r6 you need to be okay with dying like alot this game rewards those who learn from mistakes but you can also figure out your own personal preference in play
