2017 warframe is a game deeply cheated by its metacritic scores the unfair perception that you have to pay to win i ve plzuddamy f2p mmos and warframe is the absolute least unfair in pricing practices as well as the vastly inferior destiny series apart from being playable on pc what warframe brings over destiny is a truly well thought through lore and plot but more importantly it doesn t have an open world no wandering around looking for map markers you have a spaceship and a space suit that can fly so you just drop into missions if you enjoyed the mass effect series in particular this game is an excellent substitute until bioware gets its act together
