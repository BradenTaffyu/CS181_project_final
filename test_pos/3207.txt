2023 any discussion of grand theft auto 5 has to start with scale not with the size of the world or the weapons vehicles and people in it but with the sales figures since its initial release in 2013 gta 5 has sold about 165 million copies worldwide on all platforms that s an elusive number california is home to a little less than 40 million people if copies of gta 5 were people the total number of copies sold would equal the population of bangladesh the game is unimaginably large in its impact and reach that number will only increase after grand theft auto 5 is released on the latest consoles and now that new details about gta 6 have reportedly surfaced after all it s an artifact the grand theft auto series has always been a commentary that drew directly on elements of mass culture taking the plots of various crime films and eras relying on heroic melodrama and spicing up those worlds with silly violence vice city played on the nostalgia of the early 2000s for the coke soaked party scene of the 1980s and its visual and musical industries gta 4 followed the story of an immigrant into a deeply commercialized culture of grifters and schemers both games spoke to both their time and place in specific ways parodying the mass culture of those eras while becoming the dominant mass culture of the early 2000s we find ourselves here and it becomes clear that grand theft auto 5 wrestles with this paradox what does it mean to stick it to the man when you are the man how can you flip the monoculture the bird when you re the standard by which every other open world action game is measured the solution gta 5 found to this problem which i think has something to do with its decade long staying power as both a single player and multiplayer game was to create an extremely robust driving and shooting game skeleton and infuse it with every interesting idea you can think of what s striking about playing gta 5 in 2023 is how unfocused it is how willing the game is to take the player on a strange route of heists train hijackings cargo plane heists and a full torture mini game more on that in a moment in both online multiplayer and story mode this willingness to engage in any idea is always backed up by the game s willingness to return to that safe solid core the player knows that there is always something in the middle waiting to catch him that the aaa game s 30 second loop of driving and shooting under new circumstances will eventually return everything is solved by killing your way out of a dicey situation
