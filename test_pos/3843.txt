2021 when gta v came out i had heard that although rockstar refused to fix all the issues with gta iv their mistake which everyone had been complaining about effectively tarnishing the entire series they had instead had focussed on making gta v better by by bringing back some of the fun while retaining the storyline aspects of gta iv sounded great so when i was given gta v as a xmas present i immediately started downloading it and started playing six weeks later after it had finished the download at 1 megabit a week after that i d given up the beginning of gta v feels similar to gta iv unlikeable protagonist living with relative giant city with nothing to do no rampages rubbish cars everything too expensive and grind grind grind grind grind the first 20 to 40 hours of gta v are painful to go through scarred with fun parts the cutscenes are droll and sometimes downright funny but the missions pay squat you ve no idea where you re going and you just seem to be spending your time following the gps doing odd jobs for nobodies there s very little boosting cars for profit no cool rampages to get points and perks just plod plod plod if you go into a shop you can barely afford the cheapest clothes and don t even start with trying to beef up your car 30 or so hours later having just transferred to the second main character who also seemed unlikeable and living in a horrid situation i gave up it really annoyed me that even though i had some money the ammu nations still had no good weapons and armour was obscenely expensive making me either penniless or fragile some jobs were very irritating to perform because of the difficulty plus i just seemed to be spending my time driving for 20 minutes to get to one side of the island to spend 20 minutes driving back with zero other things inbetween than listening to the radio a few years later i realised over 70 gigs of my expensive raid1 hard drive was being taken up by this game i wasn t playing so decided to go back to it and give it one more try so i did i explored the city still no rampages very little fun to do random encounters were disappointingly few and far between no hare krishnas to run over just more plodding low paying jobs and then trevor happened i hated trevor he was vile and everything i disliked about redneck life slowly i thought that he had some good points to make those crazy anti establishment anti society rants of his those offhand comments those crass little expletives all started to make sense and i started to i hate to say understand him the backstory all slotted together the way michael is the way trevor is it all made sense trevor s unhinged because of what he s been through underneath it is a genius who just doesn t care any more he s already dead in his own head and just waiting for biology to catch up ranting and railing at society disaffected and disenfranchised by his own criminal actions being the ultimate a hole but at no point in the game does anything he do turn out badly he finds love of a sort he finds riches he finds a new home he runs a business he can travel anywhere and do anything staying literally and metaphorically under the radar no spoilers he knows precisely how to game the system to stay outside of society and be overlooked ignored nobody wants to be him or be with him everyone just wants him to go away and the only people other than michael who realise how dangerous he is are the fib agents aware of his existence i must say that trevor is the disgusting sh t covered p ss stained foul smelling hairy redneck jewel in this game michael and franklin are extremely stereotypical and provide a great counterbalance to him but in the same way billy bob thornton s character in bad santa is a clever but heinous person so is trevor and i d be tempted to think one was based loosely on the other after trevor joins the game things start to get interesting the jobs get marginally more lucrative although unless you cheat and look online for how to make money doing the lester missions you ll never be rolling in dosh until it s too late and that s the achilles heel of games like this just at the point where the credits are about to roll is when the game goes ta daa the big gun and you re left thinking this whole game would have been way more fun if i d had that about 50 hours ago the big problem with gta v is that there s not enough ways to make money unless you look at guides online the store robberies make you a little but a single visit to hospital wipes out all your cash unless you invest in the fickle and largely broken stock market security vans pop up with such irregularity you can spend hours waiting for owe they make a bit more cash but again one death and the whole effort is undone there are a few set pieces that earn 25k to 50k but a single property costs way more than that as are a couple of upgrades on a car some nice outfits or a few unwanted trips to hospital if you put your money into the stock market it s so random you stand more chance of losing money than making it i followed online hints about watching the curves and when i saw a stock hit the lowest price it had ever been i invested and it just went lower and stayed there wasn t one of the lester mission stocks either lost about 50k leaving the stock alone for weeks of game time to see if it went back tried hitting the vans of a stock to force its rival s price up nothing just could not get the stock market to be affected by any of the tricks online and property revenue is a joke what also annoyed me was the way cars just vanish if you look the wrong way i had a really cool armoured car i found in the city i tricked it out and took it back to my garage parked it and poof it was gone i thought parking cars in your garage would store them but no then i stole a plane and parked it in the hangar left came back gone because the hangar was owned by a different protagonist and the plane was just deleted so i ended up giving up trying to steal nice cars and trick them out i simply couldn t keep them and that is a fundamental mistake in gta v if you take a car and park it in your garage it should stay in your garage just like gta iv i tried to get it back from the police pound but no it wasn t there either so yeah gta v is bloody amazing the radio stations are good although vice city was better the story is good once all three protagonists are on the scene the graphics are just in freaking sanely good flying into the city on a misty morning is just jaw dropping but it s a grindy slog to make any money and you ll probably end up either looking up cheats tricks online or compromising with crappy stuff until almost the end of the game uipgraded npc cars seem to vanish occasionally and i tried to store one in my safe house garage but it vanished with no explanation i tricked one out took it on a mission and halfway through need to chase someone on foot come back car s gone losing me about 15k of upgrades physics glitches too can kill cars and aircraft that are otherwise just sitting there so yeah gta v is absolutely amazing game and you definitely play it but rockstar still haven t figured out how to get back to that sweet spot of gta3 they ve got the world building down to a fine art storytelling character design is top notch but the fun level could be better if there s ever a gta vi i really hope they remember to cut back on the online style grinding for cash with obtuse stocks and shares and replace the money making with fun stuff like rampages and challenges giving decent cash
