2022 upon booting up elden ring you re immediately given a glimpse of what is to come through the brilliant soundtrack starting off with a few disparate calm strings the main theme slowly morphs into an epic melody of grandeur valor and unrelenting ambition despite having already heard this track in trailers i was blown away shattered even i knew i was in for something special blissful explorationwhereas previous soulsborne titles had you trudging through claustrophobic sewers and maddening towns elden ring is a far bigger more ambitious adventure reaching across numerous regions the lands between are massive and filled with things to discover even after 20 hours i was still finding new things in the first area perhaps i had missed a cave tucked away in a canyon or failed to peruse a nearby forest once i even stumbled upon an expansive underground area that you could easily miss it s magical really much of the wonder comes from the design ethos gone are the myriad of question markers and intrusive quest logs you would find in other titles instead replaced by something as simple as your own curiosity fromsoftware uses this as a tool to compel you forward when you see a fort in the distance you will feel urged to go there and the best thing is that it was you and not the game that decided so elden ring relies on your participation and i love that the lands between stretch far and wide see that castle off in the distance that s an entire level filled with memorable encounters a screenshot of elden ring by illuya as you traverse these lands it s hard not to be impressed by the topography uneven hills and deep gorges combine to create a world that cannot simply be navigated by holding down your left joystick its gargantuan structures serving not just to undermine you but also as waypoints on your journey it made me realize how flat and easygoing the landscapes in open worlds often are in the lands between even the geography is your adversary constantly bending and defying rules my first 30 hours with elden ring were some of the best i ve had in gaming and i was ready to name it fromsoftware s magnum opus but then a realization dawned wait haven t i seen this church before there are many reasons to love the soulsborne titles but one of them is the handcrafted quality that permeates throughout every corner of the world feels like it was designed with a specific purpose in mind one that you would probably understand through your ponderings and each encounter offered a new challenge these were games that not only encourage you to explore but also feature enough secrets to warrant doing so this still rings true here but for every two surprises there was a moment of utter disappointment reused structures and bosses are frequent to the point where every foe not overtly important to the narrative will be fought multiple times it also undermines the sense of discovery since you can only happen upon so many identical dilapidated churches before you wonder if it s worth it this is truest for the many dungeons and caves they all have the same visual identity and rarely differ in terms of enemies and i have a hard time naming just one of them since they all blend into one large portion of copy paste tedium eventually i began looking at these as optional bonus levels rather than integral parts of the world and honestly i think that is the best approach it is also in this repetition that the developers misunderstand what made their bosses so special in the first place like telling a joke these encounters require careful build up a harrowing walk through a town gone mad or slowly making your way up a castle the bosses were never the main attraction they served as final send offs stages of thrilling and heart pounding action to juxtapose the relatively quiet exploration this still applies to the linear locations but once you step into the open world miyazaki starts hurling bosses at you like he s a kid training for a sports match that s not to say the boss fights are bad when you come across one of the more sophisticated fights and composer yuka kitamura starts sending symphonic shockwaves through your ears this game is delightful with a few exceptions the mandatory encounters are consistently astounding and satisfyingly grueling rounded off by exquisitely rich and repulsive visual design these moments are truly special say hi to margit one of the first roadblocks on your journey community created artwork for steam artwork by illuya elden ring keeps on going just when you think you ve seen it all it turns out there s still another half of the story left had it featured enough content to sustain this length it could ve been a monumental achievement unfortunately that is not the case there s an entire region where the only unique foe is the boss at the end the rest being awkwardly recycled enemies and one of the best places in the game suffers from a similar issue yet i can t help but love elden ring for weeks i was enthralled by its world and when i wasn t playing it i was thinking about where to explore next or how to approach the boss i was stuck on when i present these criticisms of the game it s not because i despise it it s because i care had this been a disappointment i would ve just shrugged and thought little more of it beauty and hostilitythrough the lands between fromsoftware toys with an interesting dichotomy while the landscapes are gorgeous and downright breathtaking they are far from safe mercenaries in tattered armor oversized crustaceans draconian soldiers the size of giants and even living jars everyone and everything is out to kill you even if there aren t many enemies specific to one region there are still plenty of creative enemy designs the open world also gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach these you could sneak your way through an enemy camp get up close and personal with a comically large greatsword or ride in on your horse slashing wildly at anyone in your way this makes the notorious difficulty far more approachable and i d imagine that more people will finish the game because of it the combat system itself is akin to dark souls 3 but there are enough additions to make it not feel worn out and dreary sekiro s posture system where an enemy s stance can be broken to leave them vulnerable has been subtly integrated the enemies don t have wavering stamina bars over their heads but this means you aren t pressured into a style of play the stance mechanic is there you can use it if you want but it can also be ignored entirely this severed hand is livelier than one would expect but a well timed guard counter can put it to rest community created artwork for steam artwork by illuya when combined the stance system and guard counter result in battles coming across more as duels than the old hit and run affair there were times where i had to run away either to heal or get a break from the heat of battle but i spent considerably more time facing my enemy head on you could argue that not enforcing these improvements leads to some players resorting to the tried and tested tactics but i like the freedom it brings another enemy you will face is the performance while the game runs at 60fps most of the time there are some drastic problems with frame pacing and stuttering i didn t find it too distracting but those on lower end pcs might be more affected it s hard not to compare elden ring s selection of enemies and locations to previous fromsoftware offerings but part of me believes we should look at it through a different lens for while it is like these in certain departments it s also a title that seeks to provide a different experience one much more flexible in its design contours and of a much grander scale rather than scold it for the ways it compares we should appreciate it for the ways it differs visit a cup of thoughts for subjective reviews with a touch of
