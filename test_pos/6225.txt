2021 the game itself is very fun and addictive for some reason though the player base is 60 mentally ill people there is going to be times where the killer is going to get you down and just wait for you to die in that way and they do it so professionally it s crazy how many times they did that there are going to be times where the killer is going to camp there are going to be times where your team doesn t save you from hooks and there are so many bad things in the player base but still the game is so fun and i love it update oh boy how innocent was i while typing this review i thought the survivors were pure human beings trying to survive the death trying to live but i was wrong the real devils are the survivors in this game you have no idea how evil these pure looking creatures are in the story they are the ones being haunted you would think that this is true until you play killer for a while you are not hunting them they are hunting you these disgusting devils will taunt the out of you at every second they possibly can they will wait minutes in the exit gate just to press ctrl and taunt you they will use lag hacks just to annoy the out of you in my 20 hours killer experience i have understood that the killers are more innocent than the survivors
