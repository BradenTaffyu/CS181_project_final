2016 a good free to play game that doesn t push microtransactions in your face every five mins and is actually a decent game there s so much polish and refinement you d think that this would be a aaa game from a major publisher or developer options menu is great runs at a decent frame rate on any system even a toaster could run this at high settings and still get 60fps the game offers rebindable keys and also offers rebindable controller inputs which is a rarity these days other developers need to take note this is how you do free to play right
