2022 update this is my vote for game of the year elden ring is an emotional roller coaster that is both challenging and rewarding the game was mostly problem free of technical issues and nothing game breaking beating the game was a joy but there is a great deal of content that can be missed with only that in mind the story is not in the main boss fights alone but in every element behind ever hidden wall in every item description and in the choices that you make elden ring is an epic that your character lives through and not just a series of cinematics and narrations the graphics are fantastic while they are not cutting edge realistic like some games they are complete artistic and beautiful elden ring is a masterpiece of art as can be seen throughout the elden world and all that resides within there is a clear passion seen in the many spells incantations as well as the combat actions and poses the controls are fantastic and yet a little frustrating there is a learning curve to the controls due to a small delay to input and character reaction this is due to the way that the core of the game operates it is not a long delay but if you have fast reflexes you will find it impact how you play you will have to train yourself to be more patient and treat combat with a slightly different approach once this is mastered the combat is very fun there is a great diversity with numerous weapons having their own style timing and bonuses many hidden my favorite aspect of elden ring is the story the story is simply beautiful and something that i believe reflects well the history of humanity maybe even the present possibly the future as well i will not spoil the story but it is worth experiencing and very well done there are many characters to be introduced but they have decent depth and the voice acting is done very well my one dismay is the soundtrack i found it to be lackluster and some of the songs to be headache inducing overall it is mostly neutral and you can just as easily forget it is on except for the few that have a constant high pitch tone that just repeats in short elden ring is a must play while still early in the year elden ring is the game to beat for game of the year and i am doubting anything will come close
