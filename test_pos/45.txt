did not expect the game to be this good very polished combat variety builds you have free infinite respec to change your combat style anytime you want bosses are really unique as well surprisingly lots of hidden secrets and side quests best part is you can backtrack and do all the side quest even after completing the chapter 9 10 would be nice if we have more exploration instead of linear progression path but this is just personal preferences also chapter 4 is peak update after 100hours of playtime i ve completed pretty much everything the game can offer except maxing out all spirits and equipments you need about ng 5 to get enough knot of voidness for all spirits upgrade i like how the game gives you a secret stance but require a lot of work for it too bad it can t last long that s what she said you definitely don t need to do new playthrough but highly recommend trying out ng 1 as you get some new stuff to play with the scaling for ng 3 onwards is a bit unbalanced as you pretty much hit the cap of scaling of your damage defence but enemies bosses just scale harder than you which can makes it a bit unfun still a great game prob goty 2024 for me
