2019 good old sandbox murder simulator always loved gta and 5 does not dissapoint i could wish the gunplay was slightly more exciting but the driving is great and the flying is like simulator level good i m not a fan of the online because of the intense grinding pay to win progression system if i actually had access to all the vehicles specifically planes i would give this 10 10 and i d have given it 10 10 at release but nowadays 6 10 thanks to the pointless restrictions on fun i put a lot of hours in this game mostly before the newer stuff was added and i don t think that should be locked away from me unless i put another 500 hours or 200 in
