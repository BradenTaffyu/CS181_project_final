2016 this is not counter strike this is counter strike in a house sober 2016 summary this is a short summary before i get to the actual part of the review for the game people often think that this game is the same as counter strike they couldn t be more wrong between counter strike and rainbow six siege the difference is that of between the sun and the moon the game is different on so many aspects this is more of a team based fps rather than a game where a single person can make a difference of course a single person can make a difference in this game as well but he has to do his duties first as a team member before he moves out to do his own thing so keep that in mind when you are buying this game counter strike and rainbow six siege may look like brothers but they are not each of them are fun and unique in their own way little about my experience i started playing this game first when it came out back in december 2015 of course back than i didn t buy it in steam i had the uplay version and i have logged in over 450 hours in the game here is the proof click postimg org and here are my stats click postimg org now i bought this game again to link to my steam account when it was on sale during the weekend so with over 500 hours of experience in this game at this point i would recommend it to anyone who loves a serious fun competitive fps final thoughts i would waste your time if i made this review any longer i mean i could but what i write here is already available over the internet you already have awesome guides in the steam community so if you want to know more about the gameplay and how it plays you can check it out in youtube and read about it in reddit or the wiki for queries you can visit reddit for tips and awesome gameplays check out these youtubers serenity17 macie jay score gameplay 9 keeps you coming back again and again sound 9 the ambient sound the background music everything is spot on game mechanics 10 unique game mechanics not comparable to any games fun 10 could be lower for you if you are playing alone if you are playing with friends this game is simply epic additional points 10 this game had a huge cheater base now with battleye the cheaters are non existent
