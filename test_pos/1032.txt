elden ring every review is subjective and aligns with the perception tastes and or interests of the person writing it i m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression which is why i do not assign a score i don t believe art can be measured or quantified i ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible elden ring is essentially a culmination of everything fromsoftware has refined over the years in their previous titles wrapped in a vast open world that invites exploration and discovery if i could describe elden ring in one word it would be lost like other fromsoftware games this one is filled with moments where you re not entirely sure what you re doing who the enemies are that you re fighting why they re there where you should go or what the correct path is yet that sense of being lost isn t frustrating it s a driving force that pushes you to keep going there s something magnetic that urges you to press forward to explore every corner of the map in search of an npc an item or any clue that might give you some direction but as you progress things only become more convoluted when you finally defeat an enemy a tougher one appears when you think you ve grasped a part of the lore new information emerges that forces you to rethink everything the game constantly keeps you in a state of uncertainty wondering whether you ve taken the right path or strayed into a dangerous detour the only clear indicators of progress in elden ring are the boss fights a few scattered dialogues and some of the graces placed across the map the sense of accomplishment from defeating a boss is unparalleled it serves as a reminder that despite the confusion and challenges you are making progress one of the standout aspects of elden ring is the sheer size and richness of its world in open world games i ve always enjoyed exploring every last corner of each zone and this title was no exception the world s vastness both visually and in terms of content is impressive the thrill of discovering a new area or finding a well hidden secret is what drives me to keep playing however as i explored i encountered one of the game s most criticized aspects repeated bosses while it s a common practice in some games i expected fromsoftware to maintain their unique touch of originality perhaps the decision to reuse bosses was driven by the ambition to make the world as large as possible in their first attempt at an open world game personally i wouldn t mind it as much if these bosses became increasingly challenging or had new attack patterns but in most cases the fights feel nearly identical despite this shortcoming the overall experience wasn t tarnished xd i thoroughly enjoyed every battle striving to improve with each encounter erdtree the erdtree expansion brings new mechanics and a narrative focus that complements the base experience of elden ring when i first accessed the expansion i thought it would be similar to the dlcs in the studio s other games having a high level would be enough i was wrong erdtree introduces a unique mechanic that intertwines with the game s lore if you choose to ignore that detail be prepared to suffer like never before what s fascinating is how this expansion not only adds content but also manages to maintain the essence of what makes elden ring special while expanding its world in a way that feels natural despite all the new content both elden ring and erdtree are in my opinion the most accessible and to some extent the easiest experiences fromsoftware has developed that s not to say they lack challenge but the open world design with its emphasis on exploration and freedom somewhat softens the experience in conclusion i can confidently say that elden ring is the best game they ve created in terms of ambition design and execution however interestingly it s not my favorite despite everything i ve mentioned i don t feel the desire to replay it cause it feels like a one time experience this contrasts with bloodborne my favorite game from the studio which i could play over and over again despite being technically inferior in several ways bloodborne has an atmosphere and design that i find more appealing and invites me to a better dream
