2022 elden ringlet me start by saying this was the first game i played created by fromsoftware well except for killing the first boss in ds3 which doesn t really count does it i wasn t caught up in the elden ring hype and i wasn t really interested in the game even after it s release it didn t even come up in my mind to even look at it as i thought it wouldn t be the right game for me and oh boy was that a mistake about a month ago i finally decided to look into the game and almost instantly decided to get it not being interested in the game from the start actually made me enjoy it that much more i wasn t hyped up from any trailers media or rumors i went into the game with a clean slate and it was amazing from the first time hearing the awesome soundtrack in the menu to exploring the crazy world of lands between and let me tell you i barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer the world really feels alive it s crazy how from previous mostly linear games the devs managed to create such an impressive open world the map is huge and there isn t an area which feels empty and out of place each location really feels different and tells it s own story there are some let s say tedious locations i m looking at you mountaintops of the giants that get a bit annoying after playing through the game several times nevertheless even these snow covered depressing hills deserve a special places in any gamer s heart i won t mention any other locations because it would be a sin to spoil any of them locations being behind us let s move onto the people inhabiting the lands between the npcs are there for themselves not for the player that makes them feel really alive you ve never met this guy well he certainly doesn t care because he was doing his thing anyways and that s crazy the world is constantly evolving and the npcs are too and not just that the people you meet during your adventure are as interesting as it gets there weren t many times i could certainly say okay this npc is good pure hearted and they will surely stay that way the craziest thing is you might not meet even half of the npcs if you re just playing the game for the sake of reaching the end bosses will kick your ass and those bastards will look cool doing it damn i wish i was born a cool boss too but hey tough luck foul tarnished get some shiny gear and kick their ass for a change after all you re ambitious and surely not foolish at all margit the goat fanboy elden ring has 6 unique endings that s all i m gonna say about that though don t expect to be an elden ring expert after your first or tenth playthrough the lore is as fromsoft is known for hidden in every possible way there is you get a new weapon you thought it s lore in disguise you got a completely useless pot which is completely useless oh wait it s got ten paragraphs of lore in it s description honestly if you really want to know atleast a bit of lore or you re interested in a certain character i recommend you to look up external sources about them such as youtube videos or useful lore sites but be warned there are still numerous mysteries which even the most notorious loreheads are still uncertain about but hey that s the beauty of it all isn t it i have to say i don t think there currently is and for a long time will be any better entry point to fromsoft games even though elden ring still doesn t exactly help you get through and still kicks your ass every chance it gets it s a fun ass kicking and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone even a bit interested in the genre or in the game itself it might even be time to announce a dlc reveal what do you say fromsoft pretty please tldr game of the year do i need to add anything else wait actually i do there are waifus fromsoft boys truly outdone themselves
