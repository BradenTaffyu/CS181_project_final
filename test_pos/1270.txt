2022 i like the game however it is a stuttering mess even on the best rigs also the effigies that are suppose to let you play with your friend failure to work on launch which is really disappointing honestly that i would forgive but they have got to patch the stutters and all that bs stuttering while fighting a souls boss as you can imagine can make the game feel like dog crap imo just wait till it runs better and all the features work in a month or so with a patch save your money for now
