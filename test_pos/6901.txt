2019 i dont really play pvp very much the same goes for this game i am not a fan of the weapons in the multiplayer in this game either the zombies on the other hand is something i enjoy very much especially that you don t die after 2 swipes i also liked the campaign of this game despite many of my friends saying that it was confusing for me it wasn t if you enjoy a good zombie survival or interested in the campaign i suggested this game as for multiplayer i am not the person to ask
