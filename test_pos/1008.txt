2023 i don t think there is anything that hasn t been said about elden ring at this point it is the grand adventure everyone calls it out to be the new benchmark for open world souls games or any that will try to follow when i learned that elden ring will be an open world game when it was announced i was scared that it will ruin the amazing world complexity and architecture that the previous games had this was always one of my favorite things about the souls games the logical interconnectivity between the different areas and thankfully i was proven wrong fromsoftware succeeded in every aspect to make an enormous open world without sacrificing any of the atmosphere we all love there is more to do more to fight more to discover than in any previous game and far too much to even name here while i personally don t think the game is much or any easier than the previous games it is far more accessible through various quality of life additions like the ability to mostly teleport to a grace or the spirit summon system tl drelden ring is the new peak of the souls series a must play for every fan of the genre and a great first game for newcomers to the franchise
