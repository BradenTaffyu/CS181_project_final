2018 people are toxic but let s be honest who s not toxic in a pvp game like this on the plus side the dev s do their best to keep everything balanced they re continuously working on the game to try and make it more fair for everyone to play from any angle and when something gets out of balance they do their best to redo it to fix the issue prevent cheating etc gamewise i d definitely suggest if you like spoopy games that base more around skill and technique than jump scares everyone has a different technique with a vast amount of skills you can use a list that they just keep adding to which makes it all the better you learn how to play against different styles without knowing what exactly they re using beforehand until it s dun dun duuun too late lol
