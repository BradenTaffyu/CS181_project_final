2020 i have so far only played this game as a survivor keep that in mind as you read my comments on the game what i liked diverse killers diverse survivors due to perks teamwork whether playing the game alone or together with friends as survivors you are always helping each other out tense music tense atmosphere fairly balanced gameplay great moments where you got away from an actual killer played by a real human not an ai making you feel excited what i disliked sometimes matchmaking will be somewhat unfair and give you an opponent out of your league killer on rare occasions there will be connection issueswhat i both liked and disliked there is a bit of a learning curve to the game at first you will die a lot and you kind of have to grind through this to learn what you are doing at first i figured the game would be fairly casual and with friends it can be however when playing with other random people online you will have to up your game to keep up with other players
