2021 product received for free frankly at times this game feels like one of the best games ever made with a killer concept and a gameplay loop that s managed to remain fun and still scary at times however the more i play this game the more i come to realise that this game has some serious flaws which seriously affect my enjoyment though let s start with what this game does well first and perhaps the best part of the game is its lore from the tomes to the deep backstories or overall the way it s able to subtly immerse you into the twisted trials and that allows for every experience or any franchise to exist in it then there are the aesthetics the art department definitely deserves a raise from the classic slasher tropes it was built on to the new chapters that go further to sci fi they ve been able to build an ultimate horror game now to add onto this the monetization of this game while still inherently bad is actually done surprisingly well with most things killers survivors skins being able to be unlocked through progression and while you do have to pay for licensed content you at least aren t restricted from playing on maps you don t own nor potentially perks through the shrine although prices can be on the more expensive side in this industry it s surprising that they aren t charging for more or squeezing every dollar out of this game especially for a game with frequent updates additionally for the people like me who have a fear of missing out this game does make older timed content rewards available again through yearly events or through the in game shop or through allowing one to revisit older tomes however there are some huge negatives that i ve had with this game which leaves a sour taste in my mouth foremost while i do praise the gameplay loop it can quickly become stale and repetitive especially as survivor besides glyphs which are spawned through the tome challenges there is no variation in objectives and in my opinion is a big reason the game itself can feel like a major grind i would say this gets fixed with custom matches against friends but those can be limiting the developers did say they are addressing this though next and the biggest the toxicity in the community as a killer main the survivor entitlement can be real i have had death threats for not allowing the other side to win though i can see how it can be difficult on both sides as discussion can quickly become an us vs them screaming match this is made worse through the game incentivizing toxic behaviour tunnelling slugging or through the devs choosing to nerf things rather than rework in the hope it will balance the experience which it usually doesn t lastly the game isn t that new player friendly and while there is a set of tutorials it definitely has a steep learning curve a seemingly scary amount of paid content and a store description that showcases an outdated player experience i e the game now is more fast paced rather than more stealth oriented now while i see that behaviour has shown their intention to solve issues with their game they can be very slow to respond and seem generally out of touch with the community focusing more on the raw data rather than the player experience example ptb 6 3 0 like many dev teams it s usually one step forward and two steps back then there s the push for competitive the old ntf situation and more stuff that should be discussed though i can only go on for so long despite all this however i would still recommend this game as it does remain a relatively enjoyable experience if you know how to navigate its many pitfalls edits 27 10 2021 added ending for details about nfts 16 06 2023 reworked review
