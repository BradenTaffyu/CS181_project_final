2017 great and fun game but oh my god so many issues and bugs it s mind blowing pros new and innovative play style a competitive multiplayer horror game very addictive and re playable many different characters and perks very fun to play with friendscons horrible peer2peer system disconnections and empty lobby spots are sadly all to regular camping and or griefing killers griefing survivors i just got blocked by 2 players who were camping in the basement op dlc characters cough pay to win cough only competitive playmode not any casual mode without the ranking system the ranking system seems flawed as well not matching people with similar skill experience character level it feels more like it s just throwing 5 people together without considering any of their merits in game communication in form of using microphones or a chat is not available graphical and other general bugs which are still in the game for example where some you can get literally stuck inside a pallet and can t get out except if the killer hits you the community is pure aids
