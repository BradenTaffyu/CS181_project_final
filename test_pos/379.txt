2014 the spiritual successor to the secret of monkey island titled cs go is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time wether it s the engaging puzzles or intricate story this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun the game s premise is that you re either a ct or a counter troublemaker who s job is to stop the t s or troublemaker s shenanigans such as graffiti egging houses or the such all these are of course now animated comparative to the simplicity of the secret of monkey island all in all a great game and tons of fun but it s kind of a rough port and i d reccomend purchase on ps3 8 10
