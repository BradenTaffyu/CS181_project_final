2021 i currently have 169 hours on this game i got this game only a few months ago it is wonderful but it is insanely difficult you will not run out of content to explore for at least the first 1000 hours and even then to truly get the full experience i suspect you d have to play for at least a 1000 more this game is difficult the rule of noita is expect death be wary every moment you live this game will kill you however once you begin to master the game every avoided death will give a dopamine booster shot better than cocaine
