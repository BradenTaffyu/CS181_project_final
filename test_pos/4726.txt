i like this game a lot however it is a travesty that the lobbies are disbanded after every game this really dials down the fun it was not like this in the old days of call of duty the multiplayer experience suffers greatly as a result of this stop disbanding lobbies after every game or risk losing players to other first person shooters that let camaraderie and rivalry develop between players
