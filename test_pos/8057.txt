do not play this gameyou will die again and again and look up youtube videos to figure out how to use half the spells this will lead you closer to your doom most of these videos are made by a weird sweaty texan who looks like the love child of michael cera and lurch from the addams family this dude streams 5 days a week and thinks he s some sort of noita god and he proved it by getting himself a world record run only took him 45 hours he will drag you into his sweaty cult and make you think you still have a chance at enjoying this masterpiece that makes cbt look like a sunny afternoon picnic this edit was paid for by dunkorslam
