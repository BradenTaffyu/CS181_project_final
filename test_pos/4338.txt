2018 i don t know what i expected from this game when i got into it this year but it definitely exceeded my expectations i ll be honest what got me into it was fashion frames nice graphics basically everything visual but i got so much more i ll start with cons because compared to pros i find them to be much fewer imo warframe is not a noob friendly game the content is huge and it is so easy to get lost in it there are no guides or any instructions in the game that tell you what you need or how to get it if there are any it s a little bit confusing other con is that game is quite repetitive and might become boring fast i ll talk about this issue in pros now let s hop on to the pros as i have already mentioned visuals in this game are fantastic views from different missions landing craft and overall atmosphere in warframe is just beyond captivating with soundtracks topping the cake gameplay is fun and satisfying sometimes challenging but not impossible grind is addicting once you discover how to farm certain parts which i didn t know in the beginning you are in a loop of never ending farming and it is entertaining as well as rewarding basically the more time you spend in warframe the more rewarding items frames you get when i started warframe i had not even a slightest idea that it had story i thought it was just an online game and that s it oh boy oh boy and what i got was the second dream for those who don t know it s a quest and it blew my mind speaking of content in the game and issue i have mentioned earlier there are different kinds of missions the types that change from time to time missions that are always available quests missions with story and open world zone if you play this game regularly you will find yourself doing same everyday and this is what might turn you off but don t let that change your mind developers constantly offer players new content another huge plus i find in this game is its audience mature and quite friendly of course there are always kids trolls on the internet but they are minority in warframe and finally the game is absolutely free you can acquire everything if you put enough time into it
