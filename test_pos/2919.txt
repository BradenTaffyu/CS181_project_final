2020 how this won labour of love is beyond me the devs add nothing new to single player only adding more and more products in the predatory online game mode which are made purely for the common schmuck to not afford so they will flock to shark cards they are only adding things to milk the playerbase which is now nothing but modders and hacks which r has made no effort to exterminate none of this new content is added to singleplayer the new vehicles customisation locations and mission are locked to online so to experience any of it one would have to sink more than 200 hours of grinding into the game while playing against money drains like literally paying the daily bills garage fees power bills for your house paying out insurance companies or one could give into r greasy pestering and fork out money to buy shark cards a classic example of create a problem sell the solution r have truly sank as a game developer even going as far to attempt to push these predatory tactics in the new read dead online if you re buying this for online you are doing nothing but paying for the opportunity to pay more money the online can basically be described as a paid for free to play game people created this false hype of gta v having endless possibilities with the pcs glorious ability to mod eveything but r seem to be fully against this by making it harder and harder for people to mod the game with every update for fear of them having fun by modding in the vehicles and items from gtao gta online into singleplayer without bleeding some money into r s purse the mods that are available for the game are bare basic and aren t anywhere near what we expected to be able to achieve for instance to the extent of skyrim however the single player is great fun despite lacking the hulk of paid for locked content for online but that may be remedied by installing one of the few mods available i recommend only the single player probably one of r s best works taking elements we all loved from the classic gta san andreas such as recreational activities like golfing tennis working out even yoga and combining that with the new updated gta style and gameplay it also has some of the best graphics and optimisation of recent years being a near perfect pc port in my opinion with ability to play perfectly with a controller or mouse and keyboard also a great game to play with the steam link
