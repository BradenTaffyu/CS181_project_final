2022 i got my brother in to playing this game which is not much of a feat but he seemed dead set against playing a souls game to be honest i m no fan of souls games either but the rpg aspect gave me enough hope to give it a try so far i have cursed out loud more times than i care to admit this can get real embarassing when you are living in a hotel for work purposes and you come out of your room and people are just like what the hell man my brother summed this up this game perfectly skyrim on insane difficulty this is the highest praise i think he s given anything if you haven t picked up this game and you are thinking i don t like souls games take heart this has souls like aspects but it is not a souls game this is a very good rpg pretending to be a souls game if you took an rpg and took out all the hand holding and fetch quests then ramped up the difficulty took away the easy mode indicators oh he s level 40 i should wait and said do what ever you want you would get close to this game graphicly superior to many games i ve played recently there are still some funny graphical situations things like don t look at the trees too much in the wind they look like giant dusters all moving randomly though i don t buy rpgs for graphics alone i do expect that modern rpgs have modern graphics there is no real reason for 8bit characters when the world is capable of so much better sorry small tangent sounds including music are well thought out and placed i normally turn the music in games right off this game i leave it on the music is subtle almost not there but it adds to the atmosphere rather then distract from it many times i only realise there was music after i ve died most likely or i won the fight i m getting better but this is still the lesser the last thing i say is don t be disheartened when you die it will happen you will lose a lot of runes this game makes you git gud time and again i ve fallen to the same enemy but the joy you feel when you defeat them unmatched in any game i ve ever played you feel like you ve actually accomplished something if you like rpgs especially the old style where you didn t have your hand held the whole way buy this game you may curse me in your sleep but you will enjoy yourself
