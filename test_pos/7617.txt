2021 i first got this game at the same time as my friend when it was 50 off we both played it together for a little and were at first a little overwhelmed by how vast and intricate the objectives and mechanics were we spawned in a cosy cavern lit with lanterns where we immediately discovered that you can get dangerously drunk we spent our first 10 minutes in the game stumbling around the tavern as we kept filling our tankards getting more and more tipsy with each pint i highly recommend trying it if you get the game its a lot of fun the aim of the game is to travel out onto the oceans in your pirate ship doing quests conquering other vessels collecting hauls of gold and riches and really doing whatever else you want there is nothing you can buy that will provide you a competitive advantage for you in the game so the gold you earn goes towards cosmetics for your ship clothing for your pirate and skins for your weapons and instruments yes you can play hearty sea shanties to pass the time the main way to tell if someone is experienced at the game or a noob is by what they are wearing and if they have expensive cosmetics its a charming system in my opinion their is however a class that everyone is working towards pirate legend this is the highest class of pirate which you can obtain by getting level 50 emissary in three trading companies trading companies are different factions that you can represent which give you quests that when completed level you up in that faction the different trading companies are the gold hoarders the merciant alliance the reaper s bones athena s fortune and the order of souls the map consists of a vast ocean scattered with different islands forts and outposts the pvp aspect of the game really got my attention the exhilaration of exchanging cannon fire with other ships boarding enemies vessels and taking them out with your sword and gun and stowing away in the shadows of the opponents ships waiting for the right time to pounce making sure to do all this while managing your own ship patching holes with planks of wood bucketing water out of the bottom of the ship putting out fire on deck hoisting the sails and adjusting them to the direction of the wind and steering the ship to get the perfect angle for cannon fire a cluster of tasks all at once with loud noises all around and people yelling commands it really immerses you and makes you feel like you re really there all in all this game is a masterpiece of combat and adventure one of the most enjoyable games i own i highly recommend this to anyone who wants some good pvp some amazing discovery and some downright fun time with friends have fun sailing and watch out for the kraken
