2015 i absolutely love black ops 3 s multiplayer unlike the past few cods that have come out which felt gimmicky and crammed with unnecessary features black ops 3 s multiplayer feels more simplistic and reminiscent of the older cods yet still manages to keep newer features like the jetpack from aw to my surprise it took less than a second to find a game in australia at 5 am with a ping of 40ms it seems as if there s already a large amount of players which is great considering it took forever to find a game in ghosts understandably i can easily see myself playing this like i did black ops 1 zombies zombies i m not too sure about i didn t play much of it and i did play it solo but it was really complicated i didn t understand what was going on or where i was probably due to it being the first time i ever played it i dislike the way zombies has become more fantasy than reality they ve allowed you to go into beast mode which allows you to turn into a giant slug they ve also added new perks and consumables which come in the form or gum balls or new perk a cola machines such as widowers wine i haven t made my mind up on it but based on the map alone it s definitely not as bad as black ops 2 s zombie mode and i honestly think it will be fun once i learn the map and how things work especially if it s with a couple of mates as for the campaign much like black ops 2 and aw its set in the future and though it is fun to play the storyline was dull i was hoping for it to pick up where black ops 2 left off as 2 did with black ops 1 there was a reference to raul menendez and the nova 6 gas which was interesting and unexpected i found that completing the campaign on the veteran difficulty seemed easier that previous call of duty games probably because they ve added another difficulty realistic which i ve yet to try out they ve also introduced zombies into the campaign in the form of a new game mode called nightmares which was unlocked after completing the campaign and is probably my favourite part of black ops 3 it s basically the campaign retold to include zombies with a new and separate storyline after the release of black ops 2 ghosts and advanced warfare i was really hesitant to buy black ops 3 but i m glad i did overall i ve really enjoyed black ops 3 it s good to finally play a decent cod game again would definitely recommend
