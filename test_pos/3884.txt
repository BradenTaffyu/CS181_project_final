2020 despite singleplayer telling a tale that s lackluster and which contains rockstar s weakest protagonist s since their table tennis game it s still worth playing through once for those who jump right into the far superior online mode instead here s a brief synopsis of what you ll miss firstly the cast franklin a morose uncharismatic cjmichael a fatter tommy vercettitrevor a forced concatenation of the cast of jackass on pcpthe story starts off reasonably well as it introduces and builds the connection between the three main leads sadly after they form the three man gang it starts to meander by the time you get to devin weston s appearance and story arc you ll be quite bored no matter the beauty of the world these characters cannot lift the tale of betrayal reconciliation and triumphant gangsterism out of its mediocrity it s like a made for tv version of heat i played through it once that was enough it s sadly the weakest story in the gta universe where this game shines is in its multiplayer mode gone is the loose chaotic and slightly pointless mp of gta iv now it s a fully fledged criminal mmo endless customisation of your character and vehicle while it does have an economy which slightly leans towards intense grinding you won t mind there s been several overhauls of the meta and refinement of the game loop your online characters priority should initially be to purchase a ceo office even before an apartment latterly you ll expand into coca cola factories methylated spirits labs monopoly money printing shops and the euphemistically named sporting goods manufacturing facility there s also a james bond baddie style underground base from which you launch endgame heists these are challenging but very rewarding quests in recent months they ve added a casino connected quests and within the last month an associated heist overall the game is a phenomenal experience above all the shining star is the meticulously detailed and jaw droppingly beautiful world the most stunning gameworld commited to binary code the map rockstar has created is the videogame equivalent of the sistine chapel from the trash strewn back alleys of skid row to the perfectly manicured gardens of hollywood hills mansions the attention to detail is outrageously good so much so that you can lose yourself for hours exploring the warren of low rise housing finding hidden collectibles or just cruising the map in any one of the hundreds of gorgeously rendered air sea and land vehicles gunplay driving and flying controls are all attuned to perfection your character is a little clunky in his or her movement but that s been a perennial problem in this series which perhaps gta 6 will be able to remedy you will not regret purchasing this if you love open world games it s seven years old now yet still the pinnacle of the genre buy enjoy it s a lavish and spectacular title which only seems to improve with age this is one of those few essential videogames
