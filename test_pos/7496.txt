2023 pros super fun game with friends family beautiful yet simple graphics pleasing aesthetic overall lots to do doesn t feel super grindy despite pretty much all the gameplay just being different ways to make money to buy cosmetics cons the community is suuuper toxic tho can t recommend meeting other players unless you re really confident in your pvp skills in this game and you don t mind very rude and toxic folks on the mic it d be cool if there were servers with no combat or somethin idk the forced pvp makes the game very hard to enjoy sometimes because sometimes i just want to sail the seas and relax at the end of the day would be a lot better if you could play in servers with only your ship size allowed only sloops with sloops etc also would be better if bosses had health bars instead of just fighting them until who knows when that gets pretty old overall score 8 10
