2020 early access review there are four faces to noita noita is an entire world created by the use of particle physics the flash sandbox games of old were used as a blueprint upon which to mold a partially procedural rendition of a game map to explore sand and soil flow down hillsides water pours down through holes in cave systems in a flowing waterfall fire spreads across wood and organic matter and each element reacts with others in different forms while transferring between the three main states of matter lava will cool to rock when exposed to water and rock formations fissure and tear realistically when marred by an explosion it is a playground of physics and particle properties noita is a harsh unforgiving world of monsters and destruction as you step foot in the opening to the underground caverns you will be greeted with ravenous beasts lashing out not only at you but each other in a bid for survival as the mine tunnels are torn apart in the ensuing conflict you can be lit on fire in an instant or get coated in toxic sludge there will hardly be any means of recovering damage every nick brings you that much closer to death even with a full bar of health you will always be a mere few explosions or acid pools away from dying in an instant and no matter how deep you go once you are dead it s back to square one noita is a quest to get down to the bottom of the earth to uncover the secrets of the ancient wizards each new layer is more perilous than the last and you must prepare accordingly at your repertoire are numerous wands of different attributes and capabilities which you may tailor to your liking search the world and amass gold to collect a variety of spells and with a little ingenuity and trial and error on your part you can fashion a deadly customized weapon to combat the horrors below whether that wand is a reliable asset or a desperate loose cannon is on you you could rush for the end or comb each region for resources to empower yourself the holy mountains will grant respite and boons though you d best be respectful the gods look down upon those who abuse their utilities approach each new challenge and environment with great forethought and the utmost of caution noita is abound with hidden secrets and forgotten knowledge the gauntlet which many have fallen upon is only the bare surface of what the world has to offer to one who would tread the beaten path and poke into the farthest reaches of the land many mysteries lie in wait one door opens another and once you know where to look your understanding of the game expands forever every barrier each pit the shifting skies above and the elements strewn across the world hold esoteric powers and discoveries it was a simple mission get to the bottom and finish your work once that is done you deserve your rest and yet you ve already come so far should you stop now
