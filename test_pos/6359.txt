2022 i can t really decide if i recommend this game or not first of all it s really complicated for new players it has tutorials but they don t really help it takes a lot of time to start to understand what is going on and what you should do the thing is that every single character has their own 3 perks also there are some universal perks also there are a lot of different maps which you should learn how to play well the game might seem really various with all been written above but nope as fast as you learn every mechanic you find out dbd is pretty boring doesn t matter which side you re playing as the only one way eh three ones obviously you continue to play it is you ve made some friends here and they keep you here you ve started making content here and your fans or money keep you here you like to gain achievements and it keeps you here after all this game has a lot of problems and the most obvious of them is the balance killer mains get me
