great game it surely is its community stores lots of just awesome people in it and i am not being sarcastic like many reviewers in this hub though as it often happens nerds tend to ruin the entire experience sometimes this is toxic as well as this and also this this is offensive and that is inappropriate classic i would say most of all i am amazed by the whole teabagging thing since when the entire key input the entire action has become toxic even without meeting the right circumstances of doing it as it should be i mean come on this game lacks communication completely if only it had at least commands wheel like left 4 dead but sadly it does not obviously people will be using crouch input for several purposes asking for healing saying thank you or hello playfully taunting in a kind way sometimes just simply showing i m not afk and there are surely much more potential different meanings attached to this action there is a thing called emotional intelligence it usually helps with understanding if someone is having fun with you or clearly shows you disrespect this interesting moment clearly shows that sadly lots and lots of people still lack it so what am i basically trying to say if you see an insult in everything it only means you prefer to see an insult in everything moreover it most likely also means you greatly exaggerate your importance all of the above is a direct indication for therapy no need to thank me
