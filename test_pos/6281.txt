2018 look i don t play games that require you to play online i just don t trolling really bugs me so i try to put myself where it can t happen having said that this game is an absolute blast sure some players will troll and try to ruin your day but it s very manageable it s easy to avoid them if you wish dead by daylight is scary it s exhilarating and it s a ton of fun the game is being frequently tweaked by the developers to try to keep the balance with some mixed results so it s an evolving process look just trust me if you are a horror fan just buy this game the original characters in it are all visually interesting and fun to play both killers and survivors alike i d love to see them in movies and some people don t like that there are licensed characters in this game but as an old school horror fan i love it what other game allows laurie strode to be chased by leatherface in jigsaw s lair or detective tapp to be stalked by freddy krueger in the myers house highest of recommendations
