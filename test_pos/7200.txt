2015 let me update my review of this game s pc version it is still one of the best pc versions of cod together with mw 2019 in this generation i also liked the inclusion of the split screen mode where you can also do a trick to make split screen in 2 different monitors further optimization and modding support were implemented from time to time a console version should be a must buy instead of the pc version unless you re willing to play a bunch of custom content and mods the current gen consoles version is the best option to enjoy the optimized original content and multiplayer servers are full of ppl playing many different game modes but if you want to have some fun with the custom content then there you have it it s worth getting it during the sale
