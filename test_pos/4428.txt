2019 i m shocked to say the least that this game is well optimized for a free to play game you can farm endlessly in one day without getting bored the developers have created a game where farmers can have a good time while blasting off the heads of enemies monsters come in all sizes space exploration in depth customization space ninja what more can one want the best part about all of this is that it isn t pay to win yes you can buy certain frames on the market with higher capacity no this doesn t mean that it will have you overpowered over everyone in one day the game takes skill and time to master players will need to level up their frames and any new weapons it is not pay to win
