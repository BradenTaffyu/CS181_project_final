2016 product received for free the best f2p game i ve ever come across a fair bit buggy but that s to be expected the amount of content updates that are constantly added to the game are insane to give an example if you were to compare what warframe is now to what it was back in 2013 you d be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense there s so much to cover that i cannot fit it all into one review but let s start with the fundamentals the only other shooter i ve played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what warframe allows would be resident evil 6 this game s combat system is that deep i m not talking about things like mods or attribute values i m talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have in default mode the shooting mechanics are pretty straight forward but the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode the game reveals its mechanical complexity with melee now your primary means of attack you re able to empower attacks block parry do combos through the use of stance mods the game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of devil may cry than an traditional shooter delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash and with most stance mods having at least 5 combo chains in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated stance mods the skill ceiling is significantly increased beyond that are your movement options you can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid air you can run on and scale hang from walls dodge in any direction and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump the basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of mods mods are items that fit into weapons and warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player s chosen combat style every item has 10 mod slots and 1 stance or aura slot each mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect it it through this system that allows warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player s preferred approach to combat customization is a large part of warframe whether aesthetic or stat wise you re even able to choose your own ship though such a choice is purely for show customize the interior of it along with your frames weapons etc better yet most warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding this however brings us to some of the cons that warframe can rely on a bit too much at times the game is very grind heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue print to its benefit there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them furthermore the game is exceptionally optimized and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45 50 on a mid range computer i had an gtx 660 as reference another problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy one of the worst i ve heard of so far is the inital archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in directx 11 mode there are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game certain cosmetic items and even warframes are sometimes only purchasable with platinum which requires that players spend real money or trade sell in game items to other players for platinum if one does not wish to spend real money story wise the game explains very little to the player up front and uses codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala dark souls with multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the tenno themselves there is a lot of world building content for players to go through overall though it s an amazing and unique f2p game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon if ever 8 2 out of 10
