2023 feel like a clown that wants to win duels in online competetive fps by jumping around and hoping that opponents lack skills to aim that s the game for you feel that you have more luck than skills then launch this game land anywhere pick a most suiting gun for early fights in mediocre skill bracket and win for free feel like sweating your butt off trying to actually play the game and gain points in ranked modes is for suckers that s the game for you pick a character with high mobility climb a tree and go make some coffee while ranking up by sitting afk no one really cares if you ruin matches by learning nothing after you end up in higher skill brackets you can still sit afk and gain points anyway yay feel like becoming a 0 budget low tier streamer with 3 viewers from eastern european region this game is f2p and better than overwatch fun guaranteed highly recommended
