2022 many people describe the state of this game as abysmal or terrible or unplayable which i feel is pretty hyperbolic i bought this and played it at launch and had a good time from the get go as per other total war titles the voice acing music and overall sound design is amazing perhaps the best in the series the new lords are pretty memorable and all have unique personalities and memorable quotes the visuals are also pretty tight the map feels more alive and the effects of chaos effected areas are fun to look at the design of cities across all the new factions are also really amazing and unique the field battles are very fun and hold up compared to other titles in the series really no complaints with the field battles the siege battles can get a bit tedious in my opinion but the new improvements to the settlement battles have been a welcome improvement it seems one of the biggest complaints is with the chaos invasions and the mechanics in the chaos realms themselves i do agree these mechanics can be frustrating but in all my multiple playthroughs i never found these mechanics to so frustrating they led me to quit the game or restart the campaign i played on medium difficulty overall i think this is another fun instalment in the total war series and i give it a strong recommendation i think it is difficult to compare this to total war warhammer ii which has had years of time to develop into the game it is now people also note this game feels unfinished i do think covid definitely played a part in the development cycle which placed the developers in a precarious position i do think this game feels unpolished in many ways but i would not go so far as to say it feels unfinished i ve been a total war fan since shogun 1 and the original medieval total war and i believe this is a fun and welcome entry to the series with an optimistic future
