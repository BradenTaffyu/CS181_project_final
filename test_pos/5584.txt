2022 should i play rainbow six siege if i like military simulators for better or worse the tom clancy vibe is mostly gone from rainbow six siege it s less dark and gritty and more vibrant and colorful mostly for gameplay purposes siege is a first person shooter at heart the tactics and gadgets augment the shooter mechanics if you re looking for a game like squad or arma siege likely isn t for you it was always less of what you wanted in a game from the beginning and is rapidly becoming less of what you want over time should i play rainbow six siege if i like military simulators and have played before yes at its core siege is a great game even if it isn t bang on the tom clancy branding if you re a fan of military simulators siege is likely going to be a little fast paced for your liking but if you ve played before you know what you re getting into there are still tons of tactics and gadgets to immerse yourself in even if the darkness and grittiness that was there from the original games wasn t all the way there at launch and is rapidly fading should i play rainbow six siege if i like first person shooters and am new to the game it s hard to say yes here ultimately siege is a great experience but is not friendly to new or inconsistent players there are massive maps tons of gadgets and dozens of unique interactions between the operators that aren t explained well in supplementary content from ubisoft new players are going to have dozens of hours of headaches before they feel like they really understand what s going on the players that have been playing siege have been playing for upwards of seven years that s a lot of experience and work to try and bypass it is unforgiving and you re forced to learn quick or be very bored with the game it s impossible to recommend r6 to any new player that doesn t have a lot of patience and a lot of spare time if you re a solo player it s impossible with friends it s possible but you ll arguably have more fun in another game
