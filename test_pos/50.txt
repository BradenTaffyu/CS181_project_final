after much anticipation i finally had the chance to delve into black myth wukong here s my take on this visually stunning yet somewhat uneven experience visuals and art directionfrom the moment you step into the world of black myth wukong it s hard not to be impressed the game s visual design is nothing short of extraordinary character models environments and special effects are meticulously crafted reflecting a deep respect for chinese mythology the art direction captures both the otherworldly and culturally authentic aspects of its source material whether it s the detailed textures or the grandeur of the set pieces the game feels like a living breathing work of art it s clear that the developers poured their heart into these details combat exciting but repetitivethe combat in black myth wukong starts off exhilarating combining elements from modern action games like sekiro and nioh the fast paced action and variety of abilities and transformations provide a thrilling experience however as you progress the excitement begins to wane the combat system becomes somewhat repetitive with the same light attack combo being used extensively despite the initial variety the stances and combos lack the depth needed to keep the action fresh over long stretches boss fights though are a highlight each encounter feels unique and the sheer number of bosses is impressive making these battles some of the game s most engaging moments level design visually stunning but lacking substancewhile the game s environments are visually striking the level design often falls short chapters 2 and 3 in particular feel like barren wastelands with desert and snow areas that lack depth and density the repetitive nature of the combat only exacerbates this issue turning exploration into a sometimes tedious task it s a shame because the visuals promise so much but the actual level layouts don t always deliver story and atmospherethe story in black myth wukong is rooted in rich folklore but struggles to stand on its own it relies heavily on the mythological background without crafting a compelling narrative of its own the writing is vague which might leave players who aren t familiar with the source material feeling disconnected however the game s atmosphere remains captivating driven by its strong world building and mythical elements the setting and ambiance create an immersive experience even if the story itself doesn t quite hit the mark overall impressionsblack myth wukong is a game with clear highs and some noticeable lows the visuals are spectacular the boss design is top notch and the atmosphere is enchanting yet the repetitive combat lackluster level design and a story that doesn t quite engage detract from its overall impact it s a good game but it doesn t fully realize its potential i d rate it a 7 out of 10 a solid and enjoyable experience with room for improvement if you re drawn to visually stunning games with engaging boss fights and a rich setting black myth wukong is worth checking out just be prepared for some repetition along the way curator page
