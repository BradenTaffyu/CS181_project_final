2016 ignore most of the negative reviews almost all of the negative reviews i ve come across are people complaining about lack of multiplayer party queue bugs and glitches op unbalanced mechanics and ranked and terrible servers matchmaking lack of multiplayer party queuethe devs have already stated numerous times on multiple threads that party queue is one of the first things they are working on bugs and glitchesi haven t come across any exploitable bugs or glitches op unbalanced mechanics and rankedmost of the people complaining about this simply haven t learned how to play it s impossible without queueing with friends no it s not i had trouble winning as a survivor when i first started too now that i ve actually taken time to learn how to play profficiently i can now say i escape 2 3 times a lot of people are also complaining about people leaving to make others rage i ve only come across 2 people who have done that out of all of my games and it was when i was playing with other noobs you don t recieve your bloodpoints when you do so meaning that people who leave aren t rewarded for it terrible servers matchmakingthat s not the games fault that s your fault i haven t lagged once since i started playing as for my game crashing that has only happened once in all of my playtime also people are saying it takes forever to find a game no it doesn t unless you say around a minute of searching is way too long not being able to find a lobby at all is because of the steam client losing its connection you will have to restart the game if you ve lost connection while the game is running even if it was only for a little while edit i m not saying problems such as bugs and glitches don t exist i m simply saying they are not common enough to break the game considering i have played around 8x as much as the people saying they ve encountered them numerous times i would recommend researching it for yourself
