2022 so after almost 60 hours i ve completed 3 campaigns and poked around at a handful of others the game has some shining spots in it while also having a lot of major issues with the gameplay and performance at the moment pros wh3 is absolutely beautiful when graphics are turned to high the detail of the map battle maps and units are very detailed the factions are very fun to play depending on how you like to play your campaigns i find that most units are balanced well throughout each faction s roster the narrative is absolutely amazing overall during my first playthrough i was captivated by the prologue and the story told throughout the soundtrack is amazing to listen to while playing as certain factions cons the game does not perform well at all even if you have a strong computer it is impossible to have more than 25 frames if you are running any other program in the background i could only achieve 60 fps by turning all of my graphics settings down the mechanics of the base campaign are atrocious without going into too much detail the main campaign requires you to complete 4 different chaos areas which significantly punish you for completing them unlike the previous campaign ion wh2 you are forced to play the narrative even if you don t want to if you would like to read more on why the chaos mechanic is atrocious go read legendoftotalwar s post on it because of the previously stated problem there is no incentive to continue to play the game with the forced narrative because you have already seen it after the first few campaigns it becomes somewhat repetitive to deal with making the game not fun overall i would recommend this game yes but after they have fixed some of the mechanics and the campaign or release mortal empires version
