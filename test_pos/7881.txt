2020 product received for free it is a good game with a lot of potential i have been playing the game since beta and had a lot of fun with my friends in these 2 years it has its ups and downs but the monthly updates are awesome and keep the spirit up for more exploration the tall tales are great and are something different from what you expect from a pirate game the raids sneak tactics and overall pvp is astonishing i highly recommend it
