2021 hands down one of the most fun games i ve ever played i am not keen for pvp in this game because people tend to take it really seriously and smack talk but the pve aspect is incredible the graphics are breathtaking the stories are super interesting if you re new to this game make sure to take a friend the seas aren t too friendly if you have the balls to weather the storms and assaults from other players the rewards are many of the numerous games i ve played in the past there are only 3 that i can say are my true loves and sot is one of them worth it
