2022 this game is undoubtedly a mess on launch especially when compared with total war warhammer 2 but mostly i just feel bad for the dlc team that from what i have heard have now taken control of the game they were handed an absolute mess of a game one where the main team were clearly not taking the time or care to make the game shine except for where its not supposed to with it s radioactive snow the dlc team already has released one patch fixing many things but the game has a long way to go if you want a finished experience buy something else
