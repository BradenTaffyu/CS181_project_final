2022 before immortal empires i wouldn t have recommended warhammer iii as it was the realm of chaos campaign felt only like a showcase or a distraction of the new things for warhammer iii while they were making immortal empires the settlement siege battles quickly became tiring to play the ai often bumbled around both tactically and strategically the portals to the realm of chaos itself were frustrating to deal with same for actually visiting these locations and the overall performance of the game quite often caused the game to slow down to an unacceptable pace mostly around kislev at that time i only put roughly 6 5 hours into the game after finishing the kislev campaign and decided to wait and now with immortal empires while some systems remain in place this feels like how warhammer iii should ve released granted it s still fairly buggy with a few issues popping up during my playthrough i ve come back to finally start enjoying the mosh pit of races and factions on one giant map and playing the game the way i want to as it should be like with everyone else although the settlement siege battles are still rather obnoxious to deal with the ai still fumbles about on the occasion and the performance still slightly worrying at times it s been a much better experience than it has been compared to warhammer ii s mortal empires there are some genuinely great changes that have been made here specifically the diplomacy which is far more interesting and intriguing and allowing for allies to truly shine better than being a downright disappointing doorstop for whatever comes knocking on the other side even being able to simply threaten a trespassing faction or add some intimidation to a deal you re trying to make adds more level of interest than ever before in my opinion of course furthering this comparison is the addition of the end game dilemma s or calamities that may spring up although fairly simple in concept and idea it s a better addition than warhammer ii s chaos invasion mechanic in which chaos armies on northern and southern sides of the map spawn in numerous numbers to challenge the world although the player bias would disagree with that now it s a system that involves a singular faction spawning numerous amounts of armies in a lore friendly location to perform their faction goal and with a slightly less player bias it suits the theme of total war much better than a single faction invading the way they did and it also draws end game out better and add more variety to it since dealing with only chaos felt like a chore more than anything overall i highly recommend the immortal empires side of warhammer iii as i believe it s a better representation of what the game should be a sandbox empire management game and while i still do not recommend the realm of chaos campaign it s okay to have as a side dish to the main course
