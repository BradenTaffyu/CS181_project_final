2019 i started on the 360 summer 2014 and then transferred my account to pc on steam release i ve only ever played gta online freeroam and missions and haven t played the campaign most of my time was spend grinding rooftop rumble and rolling with the boys throughout los santos i had to stop playing for a few reasons one of them being all the crazy vehicles and guns they keep adding pretty much everything after the homing launcher and kuruma made multiplayer unbalanced to each their own if your mommy wants to buy you shark cards so you can call in tanks every time someone kills you go ahead i preferred the meta before the pc release and a few months after there should have been pc console cross play at the time of release so i could keep playing with some of my friends left behind in the great pc migration i haven t played the game in a while now so i m hesitant to recommend it i m pretty sure there are many fun times to be had with the right people buy it on sale bundled with some in game cash if you want to stand a chance against the long time player base i ll update this review once i play through the campaign
