2023 tldr if you are looking for an excuse to buy this game and you are a souls fan i suggest this game the gameplay is clearly not as tight as something like bloodborne but the gameplay is satisfying generally responsive and gets the job done this is that bloodborne experience you are looking for performancesimply amazing gold standard the game runs exceptionally well on last gen hardware i capped the game at 60fps at max settings on my evga rtx3080 and experienced no frame drops my entire play through on the steam deck it sits comfortably around 45 50fps and has no glaring performance drops all around i would expect this game to run flawlessly on 20 series cards as well as late 10 series cards weaponsthis game houses some awesome weapon designs and move sets each with their own unique special ability or fable art to come with it there are a wide variety of weapons and each is unique and changes your play style significantly in this game you can make your weapons do more damage by spending upgrade materials to the blade specifically and swap out the handle that comes with each weapon do you like this electric buzz saw but hate the slow move set switch it out with the handle from a scimitar or mace to replace its attack pattern the only limitation to this is weapon scaling which is affected by the handle some handles give more strength or dexterity motivity or technique scaling than others ultimately affecting your overall weapons effectiveness in combat this can also be modified slightly with whetstone like items called cranks which are limited in quantity but adjust the scaling of the handle one letter grade in a stat direction of your choosing combatthis is where some of the issues lie i think overall once you get the rhythm of the fights down the execution of the combat feels very satisfying and ultimately rewarding the problem is the limitation this kind of game play has on the overall design of the game this game s combat is much closer to sekiro than i first expected especially if you play a heavier weapon even early on most fights have very short attack windows which can only be triggered via staggering or small hits in between some attacks to trigger aggro the majority of all boss fights are going to consist of learning the attack pattern in and out teaching your brain to remember the pattern to guard so you can get a perfect guard on hits and then landing a charged heavy attack when the bosses health bar is white to trigger a riposte counter when the boss is downed for significant damage this works as a design choice most of the time especially as there are also status effect attacks unblock able aoe attacks and red attacks which can only be perfectly guarded to keep you on your toes the problem with this style of combat is that it locks you in a very specific type of game play where you can only succeed a certain way while this works in a game like sekiro as you have no options really in lies of p there are tons of options between the plethora of weapons and arm attachments because of this design unfortunately inside of boss fights and even some mini bosses throughout the levels stages these tools are not viable fable arts either take too much time to execute or open you up to getting punished unless you use it instead of getting a riposte off heavy weapons are especially affected by this as you often don t even have time to get attacks off in between boss combos this led to me having to take a heavy weapon blade and slap it onto a handle from a fast move set weapon if i wanted to be able to use it at all for the legion arms your attachable left arm prosthetic the only arm really consistently viable in boss fights is the shield arm out of the 7 legion arms i found myself going back to this every time a boss came around this is because the shield arm essentially makes it easier for you to block attacks you don t totally have the timing down for the status effect arms would be useful but with such tight windows for attack you don t really have time to get it off unpunished also applying status effects to your weapon is just much more viable as you can play normally while de buffing the boss probably the most controversial design choice is the dodge move simply put the dodge is not flexible at the start of the game the dodge feels awful it is a small almost pivot to any direction while locked on which unless timed perfectly and during the right attack will result in you getting hit this is most likely intentional to get the player to move towards aggressive guard based game play but until you figure that out it just sucks even after you upgrade the dodge allowing rolling afterwards it is never really a viable tool for avoiding most attacks difficultyi do think this game is hard as in yes you will die a lot to bosses and you will keep dying until you master their move set to at if not near perfection there were many times i felt like there were fairly significant difficulty spikes in both enemy density and bosses but aside from one area i found the game fair with no bs mechanics or cheap gimmick deaths and bosses are amazing i would argue this game can even be harder than sekiro in many ways as you have that punishing and tight rigid combat but with the choice of having different builds and with that sometimes your build will not be as good as another for that specific fight increasing encounter difficulty greatly level designa little too linear unlike fs titles the illusion of exploration is shattered many times due to strict pathing and clear destinations heavy use of shortcuts which is great but sometimes predictable and as a result the usage of rest points feels inconsistent in later areas theme atmospherethematically this is unique i can already predict people saying this copied bloodborne s atmosphere but i don t think that is the case this is distinctly its own thing yes there are some areas very reminiscent of bloodborne especially the swamp areas but aside from that the fallen city of krat stands apart in almost every other way this game is distinctly steampunk with giant smokestacks grand victorian architecture carnival rides and abandoned storefronts littered about more varied destinations than i expected it does not get stale and explores enough unique locales to stay fresh which i consider a huge accomplishment for this type of game story charactersi consider this story to be a hybrid of the fromsoft style of telling a story and the traditional style of story telling many insights and conclusions can be met via item descriptions and visual clues within the world but characters are not afraid to start talking for extended periods of time out of nowhere gemini the cricket follows you in a lantern during your play through and will quite literally chime in and give a brief summary of the area or character you are interacting with i think many players will like this as it will be much harder to be totally lost narratively in this game compared to something like dark souls or bloodborne i do think it takes away a bit of the mystery surrounding the world and its backstory when while you are running around exploring someone literally stops and tells you the answer to what happened there but that is the trade off for a more digestible plot i guess with that said the characters kept me intrigued soundtrackgreat way better than expected someone needs a raise at neowiz both boss music and records you can listen to in the hotel are original to this game and top notch in every way just listen for yourself summarysoundtrack 10story 8art direction atmosphere 10level design 6combat 8enemy boss design 9overall rating 8 5 10
