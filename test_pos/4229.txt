warframe is a great passtime for people that enjoy games with many things to do and a strong sense of community seriously it s got one of the best game communities out there and much like deep rock galactic that s a selling point i m trying to sell any newcomers before even starting to talk about anything however it s important to clarify warframe is a farming game a grindy at times even repetitive game that expects you to put in hours of your life to unlock certain characters or beat a certain level many times battling rng to get a certain item and to even construct the characters it takes 3 whole days of waiting for the foundry warframe s crafting system to actually make it it is a free game so you can pay your way out of tiresome situations however let s leave the ugly parts aside because surprisingly warframe is one of the best experiences you can have for free if you re a fan of this sort of game my main selling points are the following the premise warfarm your way into godhood you start out controlling a warframe which to a newcomer looks like some sort of power ranger and you already kill everything in your path something very important about the starting cutscene that shows you the powers of your frames is that you actually see how strong you are at first it looks ridiculous but soon you notice you go from wow i m badass to wow i can kill this whole pack of enemies with a button and then to wow i just dealt 100 000 000 damage to a 500 hp enemy and to evolve you farm for new characters upgrades new weapons and all the cool you see other players using just playing you ll see random ass materials piling up number going up and making your brain go unga bunga then you use the unga bunga numbers to make your cool character even more on crack the gameplay is quite straight forward for the most part you load into a mission you do an objective and you extract going back to your base and reaping the rewards you got during the mission there s many types of missions you do but most of them involve killing a bunch of fodder and doing something like defending an objective collecting things hacking into some vaults sneakily without setting alarms or just going so fast it doesn t even matter lmao there s some bosses you can slay as well something important though is that warframe isn t a game to test your skill in fact i d argue that skill is barely even a factor knowledge is much much more important to becoming strong playing well isn t as big of a deal as knowing how to become broken and the more you progress the more knowledge becomes powerful if you also like trading you re in good luck warframe s premium currency platinum is tradeable which means you can experience everything platinum has to offer for entirely free in fact as soon as you hit mid game you ll much likely be farming platinum by selling items to fellow players and using that platinum to buy many things like weapon and character slots other items from other players and even cosmetics there is no premium account requirement to trade you simply have an item somebody has the platinum and everyone s happy i incentivize everyone to get rich in this game i love trading and it s really satisfying to be a part of this community oh did i mention the battle pass system is also entirely free that s a bonus point for ya in terms of content this is actually a double edged sword there is so much but so much content it can even feel humiliating as a newcomer to not know what the is going on the game is by all means overwhelming you the second you start to see just how vast it is from the different factions you level up in to the open worlds modular weapons different currencies what are archons what are arcanes is it like the regular mod upgrades what is duviri what is a gemussy amps liches sisters sanctuary steel path rivens clans the zariman all those bounties and everything this game has to offer surrounds you there is so much to learn for a newcomer it might intimidate you away my advice learn one thing at a time warframe is no race you should learn all the mechanics in your own pace conclusion if you consider playing warframe beware of what kind of game it is it isn t a game everyone would love but for the incredible cutscenes and deep lore alone i say give it a try if you re a fan of milestones if you feel hooked go ahead and interact with the community we re welcoming you with open arms it s a great game to spend your free time playing and it offers a lot of options to customize everything about your experience and yes i also mean you can customize everything you have skins colors weapons your little base your ship pets and robots even your kahl if you re a newcomer you probably don t know who he is what i m saying is warframe isn t just warfarm it is also fashionframe also don t talk about nezha in global chat lol
