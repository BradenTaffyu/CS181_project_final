2015 dont listen to the cry babys from day 1 this game actually runs well on my 970gtx and i5 4690 on ultra settings 70 80 fps just disable frame sync and set max fps to whatever your pc can keep steady and you will have a non floaty aim i experience some frame drops now and then but i hope they will fix it ps being a bf4 and cs go player i find this game fun to play
