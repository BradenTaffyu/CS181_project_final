2017 i just noticed a fellow steam reviewer proclaimed this game got mixed reviews actually metracritic gave it a 79 and pc gamer magazine awarded it 90 that s high praise coming from them still i debated before picking up the full game not the infamous starter set which limits your operators to a paltry pair reviewers decried the microtransaction mechanic which is all cosmetic weapon skins no pay to win here and then steamers cried foul when the game required uplay a third party launcher overlay i actually found uplay s in game voip crisper and clearer than steam voice so at the bequest of some buddies dedicated to playing the game consistently i took a chance boy howdy there are two modes of play either attack or defend given a single minute to devise a plan the defenders fortify bases and safeholds erecting wall supplements planting claymore anti personnel mines and ensconcing themselves in efficient or not so defensive postures awaiting the onslaught of the attackers the attackers have that same minute to send in radio controlled wheeled drones to espy the defending objectives defuse bombs rescue hostages etc and then the action phase begins each mission is a mere four minutes i ve talked to amateur boxers and they can tell you a three minute bout can last forever this game is akin to that now imagine an extra minute added to that racing hearts beads of sweat trickling down underarms adrenaline surging with the thought that in your five man crew one mistake can wreck the whole mission as an older gamer my twitch reflexes just aren t there anymore they simply disappeared over the horizon like yesterday s setting sun and that s the true beauty of this game it takes the idea of teamwork and support and makes a wondrous marriage of the two concepts playing rook a heavily armored operative who tromps along wearing frankenstein monster boots i can drop armor packs that award me points each time a team member plucks an armor kit and dons it rook has become my own personal favorite a true extension of the role i would play were this to be real like james davenport from pc gamer magazine said this game relies more on slow burn psychology than fast twitch reflexes this is a game even i can be good at this is by far the best multiplayer game i ve played in 2017 honestly as far as a group of five people generating cohesive plans and working constructively to a goal i d be hard pressed to not say this is one of the best multiplayer games i ve ever played period even the community isn t as acerbic as so many i ve encountered when that three minute action phase kicks in all of the vocal hijinks and stupidity by the 15 year olds acting like 9 year olds seems to dissipate winning a match is serious business after all and i ve never played a game in which after a successful match i get unsolicited friend requests from guys i just played the match with i generally get more satisfaction playing solo games but rainbow six siege has me completely rethinking that paradigm lately it s had me going to bed late and awakening early just to jump on and play again imagine playing tom clancy s rainbow six games the ones you played many moons ago only recrafted for this generational graphics sound design and optimization for current pc hardware teaming up with four other people you will have to plan communicate with and act with to see a goal to its end all within four minutes pc gaming doesn t get any better than this
