2014 my god i have not had this much fun since i discovered tf2 warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam there s a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff which imo is what makes this game so good i was always a sucker for third person shooters and this might as well be my favorite the gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from something i really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play you can be be at the sidelines of the battle assisting your team and picking off targets you can mess with your opponent lining them up for a perfect slash dash you can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective or you can all the ninja and come from the front guns blazing also melee play is an actual and reliable choice the controls are laughably easy to get into after an hour i was completely used to it and now with the new update 14 there is an new and better intro to the game it might take a while to discover what this does how that works what happens when i do this etc but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki i would give it a 8 10 has yet to disappoint me
