grand theft auto v is that sandbox open world experience that keeps you busy for 200 hours in single player or 500 hours or more in multiplayer in single player mode you ll find a long and beautiful campaign with over 70 main missions and 3 endings that alone is going to take over 30 hours if you rush it but i advise to enjoy and explore everything because it s worth we used gta 5 as a benchmark for a reason for so many years being in the top games used in video cards testing for its almost perfect optimization visually the game still looks good even today and the voice and sound quality is on another level we often hear the gta clone comparisson when a similar title is released and unfortunately no other game in this genre got closet to the production value and overall quality of this game the strangers and freaks the side missions and side activities represent a huge chunk of the game it s amazing how much details and work they put into these there is also the multiplayer which received along the years many content updates i dare say the multiplayer missions are at the same level of quality as the campaign missions if you re afraid of cheaters you can create a session only for you and play it alone without some features but enough to finish everything by yourself of course bringing some friends makes everything better in a nutshell gta 5 s a complete game i dare say one of the best experience you can have in a virtual world let hope gta 6 will bring to the table the same level of quality pros amazing story with great voice acting huge amount of content multiplayer receive content updates even after 9 yearscons sometimes in multiplayer it s best to create a only friend invite session to avoid cheaters my review score story 10 gameplay 9graphics 8music 9 overall 9
