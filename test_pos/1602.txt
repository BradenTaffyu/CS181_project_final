2022 the best iteration of total war warhammer is it well optimised hell no is it expensive yup are there bugs yes plenty although i personally haven t yet encountered any however it is still a gigantic step up from what tw wh2 was a lot of qol improvements and straight up upgrades makes this version really good the music is amazing the graphics and artistic direction is stunning at times the soundscape is to die for and there are hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be had here already prior to any dlc or addons of any kind the only criticism i can level at the game is next to the points starting out this review of course the awful ui although there are some improvements and qol overall the ui just doesn t mesh with the game aestehtic at all and is quite hard to read everything just looks the same also a chore for returning players because they just had to rearrange all the buttons for whatever reason the biggest letdown in this regard is the diplomacy menu which is just tiny square buttons with even tinier symbols and a bunch of numbers crammed into a small chunk of screen red on red whoever designed this should really check their eyes this is awful i hope the optimisation issues get addressed down the line
