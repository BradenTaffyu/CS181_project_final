2015 this is the home gta v always deserved but never got until now welcome home we ve all been waiting for you edit after playing for a while i can attach a more informative review will update further when enough time is spent with the story and online portion performance wise the game runs relatively well on my gtx 680 i have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size look it up on the internet aside from that the launch has been relatively smooth for me the game world is full of detail put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it it s really the kind of benchmark setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless in my opinion the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in gta iv driving is a little bit better hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so but to me it feels more responsive shooting can feel clumsy especially in first person and the guns don t feel all that special but it s still fun in addition to the updated graphics the other pc exclusive features include a custom radio station and the rockstar editor custom radio station is pretty simple add music files to a folder in the documents and you ve got a self radio station in game it works nothing more to add as for the rockstar editor it s really simple and fun to use you mainly use markers to change cameras apply effects slow motion et cetera i tested it for a bit and the end result is this youtube video will do views 400 thanks rockstar this will do i m planning to make longer and better videos in the near future the online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first since it lacks direction but you ll get it haven t played it too much to comment further but it s fun to play jobs with friends although the progression feels half baked thanks for reading my review i m planning to report on narrative and more of gta online soon
