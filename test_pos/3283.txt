2018 if you like the gta series as a whole you probably already have this game if you re considering it singleplayer is great with dozens of missions to play and a decent story if you re interested in online consider it carefully while it is fun building up your crime career the game is absolutely teeming with modders who won t think for a second on ruining your day only thing worse than this is rockstar s seeming ineptitude of dealing with the situation correctly e g the great ban hammer of 2017 or even at all makes me second guess my review i d only get it if you have more than one friend who plays it and can help you around missions or defend you with high level gear also rockstar s negligence of pc releases in general make this the last and only game i will buy from them looking at you rdr2 it s a shame because i love their world building but poor management of their games is inexcusable only recommending the game because it s fun with friends despite modders
