2022 this might be one of the few games that i have no words to say to be honest i just know that post elden ring depression is real easily one of the best games i have played and it will be considered one of the best in this decade as well slowly discovering the world exploring each and every corner and finding new stuff is outstanding never had a moment that i got bored even though there s not much lore to be seek and cinematics to watch sometimes few words are enough to paint an amazing world and let your gameplay do the rest thorougly enjoyed my moment and never ever played a fromsoftware game before game is more forgiving since you can explore and get overleveled for a boss or an area you got stuck so do not worry it s one of the prime examples of how a game and particularly open world game should be done just enjoy your moment explore each centimeter of the world because you will wish that you could experience this game again for the first time when you think back in the future just masterpiece p s i solemnly thanks to my brass shield 25 who was with me from the first hour of the game rest easy now buddy
