2022 is this the best souls like game ever maybe not probably yes but i can whole wholeheartedly say that this is an amazing game it will probably be my 2022 goty yes it has some problems here and there especially the online connectivity but i have enjoyed every minute while playing it the open world gives me plenty of space to explore and find interesting things the story is the most fleshed out of the latest from software games except sekiro that one has the story told in more conventional ways but the combat makes up for that here are so many characters in this game and each on of them has so much dialogue it is a lot easier to make out the story in elden ring than any dark souls bloodborn or demon souls and oh my god the worldbuilding is so vast the gameplay is the well known souls like gameplay but this time the player has so many more tools to use to overcome hardships in the world of lands between from better spells with longer range to ashes of war that can be put on almost any weapon and summoning ashes to help you during boss fights or while exploring the world i think even the co op experience is a lot easier than in the past games now you have basically infinite resources to call other players to help and you can no longer be invaded if you play alone invasions also have no great rewards so i think most people won t even invade yes some people hate that invasions are mandatory for co op and i respect their opinion but i don t agree with it the game offers a vast array of bosses and weapons which can be further customized with different ashes of war this makes the game feel very diverse i ve played 3 different characters from start with two of them i ve completed the game close to 100 3rd playthrough is still not finished and i have to say that it felt very different every time elden ring is one of those games which i will never delete from my hard drive and will always come back to it and play some more
