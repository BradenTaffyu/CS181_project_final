2022 just my two cents about performance so far 2 hours in system specs rx 5700 xt ryzen 5 3600 16gb ddr4 3200mhz ramnvme m 2 ssdi m having minimal stuttering and no crashes game mostly only stutters when it seems it is loading something in besides that i m at stable 60 fps and yes 60fps locks on modern pcs do suck believe me difference between being used to 100 and 60 is massive and yes me not having bad performance doesnt invalidate other people s issues at all just wanted to say that performance issues are not universal
