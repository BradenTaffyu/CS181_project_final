2017 this game is evil at first you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character weapon designs you will say to yourself how can this be free and for the first 20 or so hours everything will seem fine but then all of a sudden you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you and you will look in awe at them and every cell in your body will tell you you need to become that guy but then after doing some research online you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable so you have to trade with some dude who has dedicated atleast 1000 hours to this dark ritual of a game so gullible as you are you will start to slowly farm rare items to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this frost prime then after 20 25 hours of grinding you will start to question your own exsistence as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that warframe and then in your hour of darkness the game will hit you with a 50 discount on the premium currency and in this hour of darkness where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming you will succumb to the dark lords but not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams you will buy one of the most expensive bundles as the dark lords known only in the common tounge as digital extremes had intended because who wants to save 5 bucks when you can save 50 you will powerfull for a time you will feel as though nothing can stop you untill you run out of platinum and the cycle begins anew and thus in countinues for eternity 10 10 would feed my soul to the dark lords for flashy weapons again
