but it is one thing to read about dragons and another to meet them ursula k le guin a wizard of earthseasum upin depth analysis further down pros cons vibrant realistic and believable fantastic world combat is different yet refined and fun more challenging than the first game but well worth exploring exploration is done freely deliberate and interesting quests are primarily scarce from what i could see but well designed and interesting amazing character customizations one of the best in fact classes are revamped and offer different skills that combine well with other classes great sound design pawn system improved pawns feel more believable and interesting new race introduced adds flavor to the world poor optimization visible for the most part in main big cities denuvo restricts linux users or blocks people from playing this game not uncommon but strange business practices for a single player game some issues present in the first game can still be found in this game but most of them are improved sometimes crashes occur luckily auto save brings you back fairly close to the period and time of crash bugs issues specs settings fps had some clipping glitches and several random crashes out of the blue when upgrading the skills of my pawn s character alt tabing and for no reason cpu i7 12700k ram 32gb ddr4 gpu 3080 10gb sd ssd res 1440p settings highfps 25 40 city 60 outside content replay value the game is 4x larger in map than the first one and for someone who likes exploring the world you can spend more than 100 hours getting lost in the game it offers a vibrant and rich experience that is worth revisiting there s no replay value unless you wish to change your vocation looks and start again although you can do this without encountering issues is it worth buying yes i think the game is well worth trying despite the performance issues if you have an rtx 3070 you can run this game without many issues steam deck compatibility have not tested people reported having denuvo issues so please don t attempt to try it until capcom fixes the restrictions on linux verdict excellent rating chart here a big step in the right direction from someone who recently replayed the prequel and jumped into this game despite its technological flaws and people speaking nonsense about microtransactions that can all be purchased in game this game is a perfect testimony that with care love passion and a lot of dedication you can pull off an incredible rpg originally posted by taleplay check our curator page for short reviews if you wish to get more gaming listings news and reviews check our youtube channel as we release videos there often in depth gameplay exploration dragon s dogma is an action adventure open world game focused on combat monster hunting tactical planning and intensive over the top difficult combat its system focuses on the pawn system a system used before in the first game where you control to a certain degree up to 3 additional pawns that serve as different classes to aid you in combat the difference this time around is the change in the class system where we see separations between archer and dual wielding warriors into two separate classes it s a nice change in my opinion as it doesn t force you to mainly use blades despite preferring an archer class and vice versa the combat is intense a lot more difficult but feels more realistic pawns work together much better this time around prompting for combo skills and evolving in experience the further you progress in the world and face different monsters physics play a nice role here and can be utilized better in your advantage it s a lot harder to dodge incoming attacks from large beasts as the hitbox does feel change and the combos not so predictable exploration is improved this time around greatly the world is expansive rich full of life with impressive visuals and places to explore each carrying interesting places to visit youtube video sorcerer playthrough episode 1 the beginning views 318 dragon s dogma 2 sorcerer playthrough gameplay episode 1 full game this series includes the full game story walkthrough of dragon s dogma 2 from beginning to ending fun this game is truly something else it s so much fun and impressive for what it is visuals presentation gorgeous looking game with stunning visuals over the top visual effects and elements that left me surprised at every step the world is filled with points of interest and attention to detail this time around we re introduced with some incredible visuals in cinematics that blend excellently with the game and make things fairly seamless one hour later community created artwork for steam artwork by robilar5500 sound voice acting the sound effects are great and give a good sense of impact when striking voice acting is fairly good but not impressive in all regards i feel there s somewhat a mismatch between exhausting breaths and the voice of my character main characters from the story are well performed i must remark that the loose language is very well covered by old english expressions and foul language is well censored by different expressions that i personally appreciate the use of old english is interesting in this regard and it s something i don t remember being part of the first game story writing a step in the right direction despite not being heavily focused on the story and more on the experience this game is a step forward in that area a lot of the side quests and main quests can be missed or skipped if you truly just wish to see the game to the end it has 3 potential endings one being the true and the most interesting endings the other two despite one being good feels somewhat like something is missing my pawns a screenshot of dragon s dogma 2 by vasharal length difficulty it s a very lengthy game to complete and so was the first game since the developers have said this game is 4x larger you can expect a good 100 hours to complete it difficulty wise it is fairly more balanced in a way considering the fact that there s no difficulty picking and in dark arisen hard mode getting hit once is fatal here you re still challenged but with careful positioning and patience you can pull it off better verdict dragon s dogma 2 is an impressive game and by far one of the best games i ve played in 2024 i m excited to explore and complete this game and share more if ever i change my views on the game i only wish it would get the fixes in performance it deserves other than that i d avoid taking people s complaints on the matters they don t understand because except for denuvo and microtransactions the game is a gem
