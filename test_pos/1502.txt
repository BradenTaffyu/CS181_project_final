game launched in a state it definitely shouldn t have launched in but the devs have worked their ass off in my opinion this right now is the ultimate total war experience the incredible size of the world variety in rosters and super satisfying battling makes it really hard to imagine i can ever go back to a historical title i say this as someone with many hundred hours in multiple historical total war games
