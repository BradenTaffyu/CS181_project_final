2020 sea of thieves had a rocky launch with barely any content in 2018 however after the last big updates this is a hidden gem of games first monthly major updates get the community going a lot tons of quests voyages and story based adventures sea of thieves is about as free form of an experience as you can get which is both a blessing and a curse on the one hand you could probably spend close to a dozen hours having fun sailing around without ever realizing there is a proper campaign to follow and that s when i discovered that even though its free roaming gameplay is enjoyable enough and on the other hand you can chase the campaign missions tall tales which includes lots of sailing solving puzzles and fighting since you are sailing a lot the chances that you are going to fight while sailing is very high progression in sea of thieves like its overall structure is pretty loose rather than gaining experience points to level up a character you increase your reputation with five different companies by completing voyages finishing commendations similar to achievements or turning in specific items almost everything you unlock is purely cosmetic if you ve got a good group of two or three friends to play with it s hard to find a game as entertaining as this one final verdict 7 5 10
