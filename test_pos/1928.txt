once human is an exceptional base crafting multiplayer and open world survival game that everyone can enjoy there is so much to do in this game yet it is not complicated to understand because the game gets you a step by step instruction on how to perform task at its very core once human is beautiful abundant in resources and activities and is backed by a helpful community of players at the very start you will get a good idea of how well this game implements customization you will start by making a character that you can edit every single feature on and that s just the start weapons armor clothing and even your builds can be customized to what you have available via skins and once done with the initial customization you can still edit your character once you have access to a mirror although not required i recommend playing this game with a group of friends to share the scrap and resources you ll find also it would be helpful to have your team play their desired role by applying points into their skill tree accordingly however i have spent some time playing the game solo and i can appreciate the fact that is not as daunting to jump into the game solo as their is so much fun you can have all by your lonesome on the action side the game features a quick camera swap to shoot either 3rd or 1st person and have the camera over the right or left shoulder you can adjust the view in multiple ways that will guarantee you find a pov that suits your play style the map is easy to navigate and understand containing multiple pois and a level recommended display weapons and armor are not hard to come by as you can find either blueprints or fragments from respective chest enemy clears or quest there is a variety of weapon classes and effects with most that will attract you towards a specific weapon for armor there is a set bonus that will be granted when you equip 1 or more pieces of the set it belongs to both weapons and armor mods you can find the same way you acquire weapons and armor and everything described in this paragraph has a tier as well tier 1 5 the abundance of loot leaves you in awe as you will never find yourself struggling to obtain it once you know where to find something you can go to that surrounding area right back for more even the loot is tier based as well yet you never have to worry about being tier locked by certain loot just keep in mind that certain areas grant loot according to their difficulty and all the loot you find is not shared with people that are looting near you whether partied or un partied feel free to follow that meta humans footsteps and gather anything they find the game also features whispers which are notes usually tips and tricks left by other players a very very nice feature crafting is something that i instantly appreciated in this game as it s not hard to find what the requirements are to craft if you need to resources it will tell you if you need the skill it will tell you the frustration of placing an item down and never being able to relocate it gone the annoyance of having to scroll through your build menu to build an item right by its side gone the inconvenience of having to go through each and every single one of your chest to find resources to craft gone the nightmare of picking a nice location for your base just to find an even better location in that same in game hour leaving you to regret the countless hours you spent into building gone what i am explaining is a quick and easy build system that allows you to place an item down and either relocate copy or destroy you will also find it very easy to rotate an item on its horizontal axis push or pull and lift or lower the item as well once you store resources in any of your chest they can be used to build without you having to go digging through them this does apply for crafting as well you are also free to save your campsite and relocate it to an entirely new location buy simply loading it from your build menu and as long as you have the resources in your backpack you can re build your campsite the feature of stored items will not work for this as your will not be in your camp you will be relocating it so make sure you have the resources in your backpack i know it sounds great but the game isn t perfect as i hope the game adds the options to rotate items on their vertical axis advanced flipping and an build lock disability just three things in my opinion would make the building experience much better because you will find that building somethings roofs can be quite a headache i also would like the game let you know a reason why you can t build certain things as i have come to realize that newer builders jump into the game build their first two story house and can t build a roof because experience builders already know stability but that doesn t mean everyone does the game should let players know that very annoying as well that you cannot build a defense structure on top of a foundation and the game again doesn t tell you why that is which i believe it s because the defense structure may have its out foundation but then there lies another solution make it an option to build those structures with or without a foundation the game also doesn t do a very good job at telling you where to find certain resources so although in abundance it leave the player questioning where to find the higher tear resources such as higher tier ores tin iron or scrap resources parts plastic etc you ll just have to drive around waste gas break your vehicle because they get stopped by every single thing the tire makes contact with try driving over railroad tracks and i hope that leads you to just save yourself from all of that mess and look it up online another problem mentioned above vehicle durability this will primarily focus on motorcycles i will never forget the time i broke my vehicle from making too much road contact while driving around curves or the time i got stuck between two wooden fences or the time i went flipping off a cliff because a scrap vehicle part was in the road a vehicle should not have to be repaired every single time you go out for a drive but please beware of everything when you are driving another dislike when it comes to driving is not having an option to control direction via camera movement this one is for me personally but i dislike driving with wasd so every time i go for a drive i know i am not going to find it as enjoyable as i would normally in any other game should this option be put into the game that would obviously take away the option to look around while driving but at that point it would also be nice to have a free look button in the game all in all it is a very fun game but like any other has its issues but i am very confident these issues will not last very long as the game is very new and is already having the standard so extremely high compared to others that spent 10 years in testing or newly releasing at the price of 60 i 100 recommend this game to anyone
