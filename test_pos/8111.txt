2021 noita is one of the greatest games of all time this is an experience where get good goes far beyond the concept of learning that certain moves have iframes and memorizing a few telecasts it s one of the few games i ve played in my life that i think is just legitimately difficult as opposed to simply being of poor design nothing short of total mastery of every aspect of the game s systems will lead you to victory and to try to accumulate that knowledge spoiler free is one of the most intensely gratifying gameplay loops ever created this is a game that demands the player grow not the player character you will die hundreds of times on your way to your first win but every death comes with a lesson some valuable intel about how the game operates that is sure to help you do marginally better the next time you come across a similar situation every system in the game is stacked against you but there s enough systems that if you ve mastered them all you can almost surely find some way forward every time simply put as far as game design goes this is a one of a kind masterpiece and the absolutely enthralling visual style is just a cherry on the sundae for the fan of the roguelike this is an auto buy my complaints are minor and few first it doesn t do this game justice to call it a roguelite as its description states after 100 hours or so i finally found something that technically can carry over between runs but its far more accurate to call this game a full fledged roguelike second small ui ux hangups are irritating such as being unable to determine what the always cast effect is on a wand you are already holding the worst among these ux issues is that the screen flashes a violently bright red no matter how small of a damage amount you take even if it s less than 1 of your remaining health it s offputting for split second decision making finally the game does have some performance issues which it gratefully offsets by using framerate as its measure of time meaning the game actually gets easier when it slows down i won t condemn the game for my computer not being up to snuff but the inconsistency of the performance is what bugs me some runs will run at 60fps just fine while i summon oceans for the physics system to deal with other runs tank in fps from the getgo and i can do naught but restart until the client decides it wants to cooperate overall though noita is my game of the year for 2021 yeah i know it came out in 2020 and has been in early access since 2019 but it s just so damned good that i m actually going to give it game of the year for all three of those years it truly is a once in a lifetime type of game
