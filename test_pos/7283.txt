this game is so much fun even more enjoyable than the first one with a beautifully crafted world that never gets boring to explore despite the lengthy journey adventuring with your own character accompanied by a friend s pawn adds to the fun with enjoyable role playing and smart ai pawns assisting in the adventure the gameplay is incredibly satisfying with challenging combat and boss battles in the 24 hours i played i didn t encounter any issues like bugs or crashes regarding the microtransactions that many people are talking about i see them as optional choices you can obtain everything through gameplay you can farm gold and rc to acquire items available in microtransactions like the art of metamorphosis book used to change your character s appearance however i must admit the game optimization is very poor my gpu isn t fully utilized and instead my cpu works excessively hard no matter what settings i use it doesn t improve the game s performance you should be wise in giving reviews as i believe people tend to exaggerate the issue of microtransactions capcom has already implemented microtransactions in previous games like the resident evil series and monster hunter which even offers a character edit voucher microtransactions are simply for those who are lazy to grind and farm you ll enjoy the gameplay if you start from scratch
