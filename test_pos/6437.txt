2017 let me start of by saying that i ve never been rank 1 and have only experienced playing against or with rank 1 players a handfull of times also i mainly play killer so this review will be mostly from that perspective that being said this is a really good game it has great atmosphere and sound lovely maps and a competitive feeling whilst staying casual enough to mess around in with friends no matter what you play be it killer or survivor expect a few losses in the first game because there is a small learning curve at the moment of writing this review the game is relatively balanced and in a very playable state you ll have a lot of fun playing as either killer or survivor if you are lower rank however there are also some glaring problems with the game namely the connection because the killer is always the host if your killer has a bad connection everyone has a bad connection there is also the issue of survivors ragequitting when being hooked to keep their items which makes it harder for killers to rank up at the moment of writing this review there is absolutly no reason except for a little derank to quit to keep your items but my biggest problem with the game is that balancing issues stay in game for way too long and it can take up to months for a single unbalanced issue to be resolved still in it s current state i d say this game is worth picking up especially if you got some friends who play it
