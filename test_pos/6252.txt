2022 as is the case with a lot of long tail online games me having 50 hours of gametime 10 on gamepass before buying on steam isn t really enough for a full opinion dead by daylight is a game that by what i see from experienced players is fun up until you actually get good at it i m only now at a point where i m knocking on having multiple killers in level thirty and ranking gold in the monthly scoring system and even now i m starting to see the cracks in the system matchmaking occasionally throws me in with experienced players for whom dbd is a pure numbers game now more eve online than a horror survival game on its face it s a fun game it has some of that sea of thieves charm to how the developers seem like nice people doing their damndest to keep their broken game running as well as possible as of this writing nurse isn t playable purely because a small update made it so she d get stuck in the floor and be unable to move a problem that came up with the twins at launch it s fun the lore for killers can be a little goofy at times in a good way the problems arise from the player base being toxic for the sake of doing something new after logging too many hours they want to have fun again but the only way they can think to do that is pub stomp newer players and taunt them i just got a match where three survivors did literally no objectives and just stood in a corner because they d done the math and figured out my character couldn t carry all three of them to a hook so if they used the right perks they could maximize the game s currency earnings without playing at all and when called on it they said they were making the game fun again dbd is fun but it demands you know when to log off
