2015 update still loving the game and it hasn t gotten old yet get it review below this game i have to say imo blows most other competive mp shooters away its been a while since my heart has raced during a shooter the immersion is insane graphics are decent nothing mind blowing once you see what can be done your hunger to experiment snags you the game is also fairly intuitive and everything begins to make sense very quickly however the ability to execute what is learned takes skill not really sure what network issues people were complaining about i haven t encountered any nor any bugs except for one random crash more thoughtsuplay is really the only downside however for most of my time during the game it was quickly forgotten there is no story the price of this game should go down to maybe 40 or 30 the community so far seems nice however when the casual and more serious players mix the open mic can get obnoxious aka people at others for sucking or not doing well the team play that i have experienced tends to be more on the non verbal side and people just stick together the class system is kinda nice but sucks when the class you want is taken theres more that can be said but if you like insurgency cs go and many more titles you will like this
