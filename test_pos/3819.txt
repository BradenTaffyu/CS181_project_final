2015 sandbox game with a take it or leave it storyline and lots of city to explore it departed from the locked areas of the map that that previous games had everything is explorable from the minute you are able to walk the streets the storyline is very impressive you have three very distinct personalities involved in the form of trevor a sociopath with anger issuesmichael the professional bank robber with family issuesfranklin the illiterate gang banger trying to make it biggreat visuals and graphics if your rig can handle it there were some folks having issues along with butter smooth gameplay and 60 fps throughout the entire game again depends on your rig of course sound the usual station selections are here along with some new ones the absence of the funny commercials is really obvious to me but i actually liked them gameplay the only issue i can say i had with the gameplay was the fact that the driving engine still needs some work it s worlds better than gta iv but still nothing compared to the sr series sometimes you hit a curb and keep your grip othertimes you hit the same curb and end up getting rolled 20 times there doesn t seem to be much consistency with it shooting it s not what i would say tight unless you re using the mouse and keyboard i found it to be very forgiving as far as distance shots and headshots probably to compensate for the fact that most people use a gamepad for a game like this some cons in a game that revolves around driving you d think there would be an easier way to get your cars or at least be able to use them but if you do any mission that you drove up to in your custom vehicle it s gone it might some of the time end up in the impound but about half the time it s just plain gone the only real vehicle you have that is consistent is the default one so don t waste your money at the beginning of the game souping up an infernus you jacked there s really no point even when you get a place to store your vehicles you still have to take a cab to get them out of the garage and if you lose it in the water or get it blown up it s gone for good also the other thing i didn t quite understand was the fact that the hang out function of the game seemed to be just thrown together and didn t really have a purpose nor does it integrate into the storyline i was at a portion of the game where michael and trevor hated each other one of the many and yet i called him to hang out and took him to a bar played tennis etc and they acted like best buddies all in all it s a good game i wouldn t say there is lots to do beyond the main missions the focus seems to be just getting through the game and then trying out the online version of the game there aren t even any end game unlocks or interesting things to do beyond one mission for trevor so i d give it 9 10 for the game overall9 5 10 for the graphics and attention to detail for small things you may never notice but do appreciate when you see them and once you win the game for the first time you owe it to yourself to replay the first few missions to see how the three of them had their stories intertwined even before you really knew who they were
