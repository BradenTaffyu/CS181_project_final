2018 recommended for competitive fps gamers different maps offers different type of strategies and a lot of teamworks which makes this game so fun to play with friends this game purely rely on your aim mechanical skills general game sense and iq on the other side valve s matchmaking is playable but at least 2 10 games i ve encounter cheaters and smurfers which was arguably exists not just in csgo but in any other games also if your are really into competitive gaming with less cheaters and wants to team up with serious minded players i would recommend to have a 3rd party matchmaking system such as faceit or esea valve s csgo matchmaking is good but 3rd party mm have more like minded players
