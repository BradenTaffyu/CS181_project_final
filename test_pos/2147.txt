2023 i love this game winning or losing it is a blast trying to knock someone out or have them miss fly kicking me only to go right to their death is hilariousthe characters are adorable and plenty of cute in game colours to unlock yes there is a gacha system but you don t ever have to touch it if you need to get a certain skin to enjoy the game that is all on you they have plenty of animals for free unlocked through in game shop and even achievements to be happy with only gripe is i wish costumes were not tied to certain colours they should of been actual costumes and placed over any colour of said animal it was for also play without vc because as always games like this just has alot of players who are toxic because winning a silly party game is their only achievement in life and will swear and throw racist slurs good thing you can mute them entirely
