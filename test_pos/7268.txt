dragon s dogma 2 is a phenomenal open world rpg that manages to improve upon most of its predecessor s mechanics excelling at character progression and providing a sense of adventure though people should be aware that it also kept the same design decisions that had already made dragon s dogma 1 a fairly niche rpg experience pros cons incredible attention to detail in world design makes exploring on your own accord a consistently rewarding experience much of the game s best content is hidden away without the player ever being directly pointed in their direction valuing player agency the pace of the game can be quite slow frequent backtracking across vast stretches of the map and very consistent refighting of enemies that used to be more sparse in the previous title can be jarring on occasion character and pawn progression have been vastly improved through inclusions such as pawn specializations as well as overall greater skill diversity especially when considering the newly added vocations many sidequests can be overly cryptic either in what you are supposed to do or in the very mechanics of the game for example the acquisition of maister skill tomes is not only tied to their respective quests but also to their affinity with involved characters absolutely amazing presentation both due to the gorgeous graphics and also the superb framing of many of the encounters such as fighting a medusa in a hidden away temple and finding ways to manipulate her gaze attack or the wingbeat of a griffin breezing across the grass there are some noticeable balancing issues both between vocations but more so with the player outscaling enemies towards the latter half of the game leading to an overall pretty easy game with a distinct lack of a hard mode or an equivalent to the bitterblack isle megadungeon specsz790ud axi7 13700kgeforce rtx 407032 gb ddr5 technical issues and performancecontrary to many other reviews i have not experienced any noticeable issues with the above system i have not crashed throughout the entirety of my playtime nor did i encounter any broken quests or other miscellaneous glitches performance has been very consistent as well with the single exception in the city of vernworth causing me to drop between 5 and 10 frames on occasion graphics and sounddragon s dogma 2 looks absolutely phenomenal apart from sheer graphical fidelity there is an obscene amount of detail in the environment and how creatures interact with it a lot of this is also somewhat needed as arguably the game s best moments are hidden outside of the main quest and are therefore reliant on the player picking out clues from the environment to find them a tower in the distance a statue pointing towards a shrine hidden somewhere in the mountains and more dragon s dogma 2 a screenshot of dragon s dogma 2 by halicor the sound is a bit of a mixed bag overall i find dd1 s ost to be a bit more memorable though here it is still perfectly fitting weapons feel and sound impactful and i have found the voice acting to be quite good in both english and japanese one thing to note is that regardless of the quality of the music it can be a bit jarring to dip in and out of the same combat tracks since especially large enemy encounters have become a lot more common story and settingdd2 shares the same setting as its predecessor in which the player controls an arisen once a regular human who stood against a dragon and for their efforts had its heart taken by the same dragon thus becoming effectively immortal but also bound to eventually confront it again this is all linked to a political intrigue surrounding the sovereignship of one of the two major kingdoms there is a significant focus on making dragon s dogma 2 a bit more of a narrative experience many sidequests will cross over one another in ways that may not be apparent at first there are no quest indicators either forcing the player to go out of their way and intuit how a story may progress like the many optional encounters hidden away from the main story the questing experience relies heavily on the player making an effort to seek many of them out on their own a point of criticism should be that there are both time sensitive quests and multiple points of no return during the story which are not always properly communicated while i found the main story to be serviceable and the sidequests actively quite good sometimes the game is a bit too ambiguous for its own good such as during the notorious sphinx riddles or albeit this not being strictly speaking a proper quest the completely unreasonable task of finding seeker tokens 220 medals hidden all across the obscenely huge map gameplayas an action rpg dragon s dogma features a selection of class kits the player can freely switch between these range from fairly standard archetypes such as archers fighters and mages to more eccentric additions such as the new mystic spearhand a battlemage archetype each of these vocations levels up separately from the player offering both skills that are unique to itself and augmentations that can be freely used on any other vocation as well heavily incentivizing experimentation aside from the arisen players also create a pawn who acts as a permanent party member and that doubles as a soft multiplayer feature this is due to pawns being shared online allowing any player to hire up to two additional pawns next to their own pawns learn during gameplay as well as such if your pawns has witnessed you completing a quest objective it will offer guidance to another player hiring it into their party i do genuinely love this concept as it is very appealing to try and develop your pawn to be more useful to other group compositions as well i do kind of wish that the quest guide functionality would be a bit more in depth than just the pawns generally guiding you to the location in question however in combat aside from the skills you set yourself according to your vocation an integral part of dd is the ability to grab and climb on monsters in dragon s dogma 1 it was vital to be able to deal significant damage which this game is a little less strict about due to simply higher damage potential but is still a vital part of gameplay some enemies require it for certain objectives such as being able to behead a medusa as such few skills or mechanics feel meaningless in combat rather it is up to the player how deeply they want to engage in their party building due to the difficulty of the game generally becoming easier and easier however people may miss the sheer depth character building could reach during a dungeon like bitterblack isle this would also constitute my greatest criticism as currently dragon s dogma 2 becomes quite grindy due to the time limited postgame requiring a vast amount of raw resources to max out your equipment whereas there is no true content that actually requires it and thus rewards carrying on the gameplay loop past the initial playthrough final thoughtsdragon s dogma 2 is a fantastic sequel it is very close to being the best open world game that i have played too with most of my criticism stemming from the fairly niche design decisions that however also make up its appeal limited fast travel may be obnoxious but it undoubtedly adds to the immersion and supports the exploration that the game so heavily relies upon for example it is dd1 but more of it be that for better or for worse follow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality reviews regularly
