in 2013 this game was something i saw as a scathing critique on avarice and on the ever growing rise of vapid nonsense content especially in how michael s kids are and a lot of meaningless spend of in game currency is needed to get that 100 so you re forced to participate in it fast forward to 2024 and this game is now a glaring model in corporate avarice in pumping out vapid nonsense content that people still shell out 100s of dollars for in game currency to be able to keep up in terms of good gear and all of the other bs it feels like you ll need to engage in the new modes if you haven t been no lifing this game since they actually fixed the multiplayer but i enjoyed the singleplayer enough that i would always happily go back to it if i need to kill a week or so off work
