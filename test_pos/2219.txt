2021 out of all the brs i ve played extensively pubg warzone apex danger zone fortnite this is the one that i actually continue to enjoy warzone is way too sweaty pubg s the engine lag is too unforgivable fortnite is too goofy and danger zone has too little to offer the movement mechanics in apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless the legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don t feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like overwatch can and that skill ceiling is insanely high developers are constantly adding content again and games queue up very quickly so it doesn t get boring if you tried apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of season 7
