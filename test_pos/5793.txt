2020 this game is pretty fun comp is full of toxic maniacs who yell at you and throw games if they don t get to die instantly by spawn peaking as jaeger you also get a guy who watched one rainbow guide video that was uploaded right after the release of the game who follows that guide religiously and will cry piss his pants and and if you even dare to say that the guide uploaded in 2017 isn t the best guide for the game currently finally if you somehow survive the show that is a single round for longer than 3 minutes there will always be that one person who whispers in your ear heal yourself as if in a realistic hostage defense situation the souls of your dead comrades will tell you to reload you gun what i described was ranked if you think that you escape the autism that is matchmaking by queuing for casual you re wrong you will have all of the people i described above and timmy the quadriplegic make a wish child who s one last wish was to screw over every game he plays in by screaming into his mic that can get a senior discount at any participating location that he wants to play the one off meta operator that you decided to pick even though there are 26 other operators he could play as he will team kill you if you even give the slightest negative comment about how he s playing because clearly it s his team fault that he s gotten 0 kills or assists for the entire game just for him to throw a hissy fit about how the enemy team is hacking because they can hear him chungus his way to the world s most open sight line that the enemy has held for the past 3 rounds that boy will also have amazing ideas like let s all go recruit or shield rush even you you took my main warden reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i m gonna call my dad he own s ubisoft also casual matchmaking is great when you get paired against a top 500 pro team who s warm up is destroying the hopes and dreams of every enemy in the game and you get 3 people who go afk right when the game starts and 1 person who just installed after the virtual anal raping that you just received you decide to uninstall the game and never play but as you go to sleep on the wet floor boards of your dungeon master s dungeon the game calls to you it tells you that if you spend 300 on skins you ll finally get a good team after applying for a home mortgage ubisoft says that your monetary sacrifice wasn t enough and that you need to give more to play the game or else you ll infinitely have a ping that makes you think you connected to a server in turkey where everyone speaks english but what actually happened is the monkey zoo of a support team decided to bust a communal nut on the us servers if you even dare to say something negative about ubisoft you re post will be removed for racism and you ll be banned from wherever you said something negative about the game even if you think you re having fun using an operator little billy will complain on r r6 about how you killed him once and ubisoft will care more about that one post than the fact that the entire sub is complaining about how reworking a community loved map maybe isn t the best use of time when there are 4 maps that are out of the map pool because they still need to be reworked and ubisoft will nerf your operator even harder even though so many other operators still need a rework or need to be balanced10 10 would recommend playing with friends
