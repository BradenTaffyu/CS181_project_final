2017 i am not sure if you noticed but i don t play multiplayer first person shooters at all with the exception of games like tf2 that i played a long time ago and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up i mostly avoid it because i suck at these sorts of games i have terrible aim terrible reaction time terrible eyesight and add in a pinch of just being plain crap so why this and better question if i am so bad how can i even possibly do well and recommend this game well i started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them everyday they would ask me to buy the 20 version of the game so i could play with them keep in mind this was maybe 5 6 months after the game launched so i know it had a rough launch and was not well received eventually i just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore i played some matches i was understandably bad as expected sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing it is just a fact of life the game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though so i kept with it until i unlocked some new operators to try out after unlocking them i was also bad with them i messed up bad felt embarassed wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone but i stuck with it learned and was to a lesser degree a useful member of the team as long as i got whatever my operator ability was used up i could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team i tried things out practiced more got better tried new things where did that put me well my aim is still bad i still miss obvious stuff and i still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me but what i did learn was that you can still win with better tactics instead of always needing more skill see i just need an extra half full second if i can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time i stand a chance with better tactics you can usually counter many skilled players thats how i can get the success i have had in this game it feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming reaction time skill the game is good and has only gotten better over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on and the new characters are always a treat to use the only thing that has gotten worse is the community with all the csgo kids moving over to playing siege but that is tolerable at the very least as for which game pricing option to get the 20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it if you do you can spend 40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators thus equalling the normal game purchese price meaning no net loss for you it is what i did so in other words i highly recommend it coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters i think that is saying a lot
