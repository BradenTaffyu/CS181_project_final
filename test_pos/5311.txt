2018 honestly i think you should buy standard or gold on sale only reason is you ll be buying them with money anyways because you ll be tired of grinding them and wanting to play the rank games use different operators buy gold if you want the season pass read the perks advantage of having this pass on their forum these options save your money and this is what i realized after buying normal edition which is the starter edition starter edition just the game with 6 random normal operators no dlc operators standard edition every normal operators no dlc operatorsgold edition every normal operators season pass 6 new dlc operators will be unlocked for free when they are released basically you get the new operators faster than other players while other players have to wait for a week and they need to purchase complete edition every operator incl normal and dlc that has released in r6 dlc operators or not they re equal you ll be using back and forth from normal to dlc operators as they re useful not a pay to win game
