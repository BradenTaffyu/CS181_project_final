2022 elden ring a game that has exceeded my already high expectations fromsoft have managed to somehow create a huge and i do mean huge open world version of dark souls with lots of bloodborne and sekiro in the mix too that surpasses them all in pretty much every way a game full of wonder secrets and excitement all the way through the art style and soundtrack are glorious and of course there s the challenge it s tough at times but rarely does a game feel so satisfying overcoming those challenges great fun a fantastic gaming experience i highly recommend elden ring
