2016 i am gonna go ahead and compare rainbow six siege to cs go like many others do but there s a good reason for that to give you an understanding of my transition to siege you must know that i ve played over 1 600 hours of cs go on this account and another 600 on my smurf account to this day i think that cs go is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made but at this point it has been heavily malnourished by its creators and in turn the community what i love about cs go is the factor of skill a testament to a good game is that you get better at it the more you play and cs is or was just that that was when the only thing that mattered in the game was how good of a player you are but that has changed a long time ago cs go has become a money making machine and nothing more valve has proven to not give a crap about the everyday player by having an anti cheat system that is beyond broken for a company that makes so much money you d think that protecting the game from cheaters would be their priority it isn t the priority is new cases skins simply just more ways to make more money i came to a point where i had to pay an additional 7 a month for esea to properly play cs go but i gave hope of supporting a game that is simply heading nowhere and i m not going to dwell deeper into the community anyone who has ever played the game will know how toxic immature and unpleasant it is after i gave up hope on counter strike i started looking for a shooter that would replace it i ve tried many insurgency battlefield call of duty well i had to try to no avail because even though i had fun playing those games they were all missing something something that would keep me there for longer and then i found siege even though i m only about 90 hours into the game i already know i m going to keep playing for a lot lot longer it has everything i was looking for skill factor check good maps mostly and a lot of ways to approach a situation check customisation that doesnt require you spending hundreds of dollars check with siege you get to appreciate the hours you put into it because the game might be easy to get into but it requires a lot of hard work to master and that makes it a good shooter it plays however you want it to play either fast paced or a slower tactical approach and it rewards you for actually using your brain i was never a big fan of ubisoft but with this and the few hours i played of for honor they re finally heading in the right direction so if you re tired of cs go and you re looking for a replacement try siege if you give it enough time to realise the depth of the game i m certain you will not be disappointed
