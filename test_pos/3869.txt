2018 i bought the game mainly for the story mode and i ve been greatly enjoying it however i don t think gta o is worth playing the community is pretty toxic first time i loaded in online i get called a noob repetitively cause i was a level 3 whether you should get the game or not for the online mode is on you but personally i think the story mode is where rockstar gave all its love towards if you played the console version los santos remastered in 60 fps on pc is definitely something to witness
