2020 ah man where to begin the art design playful whimsical charming paired with the fantastic water effects and the day night cycle the world feels uplifting from minute 1 you can practically smell the crisp salty air the learning curve reasonable you can master the basics within the first hour and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life the play style interestingly enough you don t level up your weapons skills or ship s abilities the changes are purely cosmetic and i love it while i ve enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves this style feels much more comfortable you get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item a cool ship s livery a flashy new hat but you aren t penalized for being a newcomer yes the fancy canons look nice but they are just as powerful as the default canons you build your reputation with different factions aka companies which leads to unlocking better paying gigs aka voyages and cool looking items this works to the benefit of everyone in your crew a sailor who has a higher rank with a specific company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better paying voyage and then everyone in their crew can participate i love this if you happen to outrank your friends crewmates you can offer to buy that voyage some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page ie tall tales but that s ok means you can have a positive experience doing one off voyages some times and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs my experience so far i played the beta but only recently bought the game even though i missed a massive gap of updates i don t feel left behind i love going on adventures with my friends or winding down the evening with some solo slooping i live in a different timezone than my crew which has meant i have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre adventure prepwork gathering supplies for the ship fishing and cooking said fish so we ll have extra stamina it s fun and is surprisingly soothing pvp has been interesting when i solo i try to avoid conflict when i m with my crew we meet it head on both dynamics are enjoyable being stealthy hiding behind mountains darting around the map versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly so good why i especially like this game and why you might like it too i m a fan of all things nautical and i come from a wow background for me this feels like the best parts of wow you can tackle massive monsters with your friends you can choose to grind for random achievements and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration plus the outfits livery options since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic you can mix and match to your heart s content i imagine you would not like this game if you only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games you hate everything to do with water i imagine you would like this game if you have always wanted to be a pirate you have at least one person to adventure with some of the time you like to blow things up you like to sneak away from danger when playing other games you find yourself getting lost and spending hours not doing the mission objectives but have a better time for it tl dr i highly recommend this game for the buccaneer in all of us
