2023 disclaimer the game is currently filled with hackers so if you re interested in the pvp multiplayer don t bother there are mods to fix it with custom secure servers but it s in beta as of now and you gotta pay for that so yeah it also has stuttering issues that can be fixed with a patch or the boiii client that i talked about if you plan on playing coop campaign or zombies go ahead it s amazing this review will focus entirely on zombies which is pretty much the only thing i m interested in imo best cod zombies everthe slide movement thingy makes traversing maps fun without adding overwhelming invasive stuff like advanced warfare campaign the gobblegums are fun and add a new twist again without being overwhelming even old maps that didn t have much to offer aka no main easter egg are interesting thanks to this mechanic and i really appreciate that the progression system with levels and gun xp incentivates me to use every gun and that s great i also love that you can basically get calling cards for pretty much just playing the game it s really nice despite being incredibly simple the new zombie maps are great the easter eggs are really fun and you can really feel the tension while doing them so it feels rewarding as plus most of them can be done in solo i really am not a fan of first person shooters i suck at them but zombies is a coop experience that i love and i m thankful i was able to experience it idk i love this gameedit as of may 22nd 2023 the boiii client received a cease and desist letter playing multiplayer cod is harder than ever if you use the t7 patch you can t do the coop campaign nor public pvp or zombies your only way to play this game as of now without hackers and stuttering issues is by using the t7 patch in a private match with your friends that also need to use the patch it s still my favorite cod zombies but it s a shame that activision sucks ass
