2014 warframe is undeniably one of the most satisfying experiences i ve had with a free to play title it contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons mods and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations the game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics and the great feature of warframe is that it always contains a challenge from raiding the orokin towers to hunting down the elusive stalker and harvester something is there to put your mettle to the test and in case it wasn t clear you play as freakin space ninjas what s not to love
