2019 two survivours sacrificed already one dying on the hook and one wounded just another evening on yamoka estate classic japanese mansion in the middle of overgrown garden i just lost the wounded survivor i was chasing but that was okay i knew exactly he was going to rescue the hooked one i threw a hatchet just right juicy splash sound and scream told me i just got another four kills round just pick up the downed survivor hook him and prepare for post game chat dead by daylight follows a scheme of typical horror group of friends try to escape a killer here we have four survivors and trying to fix 5 generators to power up gates that allow them to escape killer on the other had does what killers do damages generators hunts survivors and places them on sacrificial hooks while it sounds simple maybe even kinda boring sometimes i catch myself wondering why i have fun watching progress bar of the generator couple of thousand players every day gotta mean something currently there are 15 killers available in game from wraith with his invisibility through hatchet throwing huntress to ever stalking shape killers differ between themselves by their powers in addition to perks later and as such it requires different playstyle when playing as chainsaw running hillbilly and different when playing as blinking nurse killers also have power addons they can use up to two of them each trail with different effects depending on rarity for example huntress can use addons that increase her speed when preparing to throw a hatchet carry more hatchers inflict various status effects on hit survivors or simply down them upon successful throw although this decreases amount of carried hatchets by 4 where default is 5 survivors have to outsmart or outrun later the killer fix generators and finally open exit gates to survive the trial they don t differ that much between themselves other than looks or names they are defined by three personal perks that with progression can be unlocked for other survivors therefore i kinda see survivor selection as purely cosmetic to some degree additionally they can bring to the trial or find them in chests scattered around the map items that can help them win such as medkits to heal themselves or the others survivors have 3 health states healthy wounded and dying toolboxes to speed up generator fixes or temporalily destroying hooks flashlights to blind killers for a few seconds and so on just like killers powers those items can have addons attached which increase their effectiveness or duration of use every action provides players with bloodpoints which are later used for character or characters bloodpoints are collected per account not per character progression this takes place on the bloodweb where each character is offered a few randomly generated nodes containing items item power addons perks or offerings each completed bloodweb on given character increases their level unlocks perk slots at 5th 10th and 15th level and gradually increases the bloodweb size up to level 50th which allows to increase perstiege level on that character in return for prestiege cosmetic set element perks give character special active or passive abilities which make some game aspects easier or harder for opponent both killers and survivors have their own shared pool of perks and each character has 3 unique to them perks that is until levels 30 35 and 40 of bloodweb where they can unlock them to be found by other killers survivors each character can have up to 4 perks active at the same time and i have to say it s kinda fun to think of builds to use even though there are some meta perks for both sides last type of unlockables the offerings offer bonuses to the players for example you can get 50 75 100 more bloodpoints in given category objective survival altruism and boldness for survivors hunting deviousness brutality and sacrifice for killers increase your or every survivors luck by few percent increase bloodpoints gained in all categories by 25 or 100 for either you or all players in the game some of them influence map layouts or visibility by for example increasing decreasing amount of chests with items spawning on the map increasing decreasing distance between hooks or thickening or lessening the mist killers can also get mori offerings that allow them to either kill the last survivor by their hand kill one survivor that was hooked at least once or kill any survivor that was hooked at least once if you are wondering what to start learning first nurses blinks distracting killers ect i d say develop thick skin first because the community can be the worst part of the game there are plenty of ways players can be asses to each other t bagging survivors killers standing next to hooked player to prevent his teammates from rescuing him ect truth is both sides have their own made up sets of rules and as such survivors can blame killer for camping even if it was another survivor trying to loop killer near the hook killers are slightly faster than survivors so any straight chase in the open has only one ending survivors on the other hand have map elements to help negate killers speed such as vaulting through the windows dropping pallets ect this is called looping using map to distract or escape killer or by simply checking area around the hook before leaving to find others another common rule is tunnelling if the killer finds freshly off the hook survivor and his rescuer survivors are mad when killer goes after already wounded player common sense really enemy you have to hit once to down him vs enemy you have to hit twice or calling killers off for using overpowered perks such as earlier mentioned noed or hex ruin which slows generator fixing process like come on there are just 5 totems spawning on each map and these are in game for a reason killers are no better they tend to get mad for gen rushing survivors focusing on quickly completing generators usually when one of the survivors is a distraction for the killer i did mention that generators are the only thing survivors have to do yeah i did blame survivors for doing their jobs they also get mad for looping overpowered survivor perks or for bringing flashlights but the most common reason for killers going toxic on survivors are swf groups players grouping up with their friends usually with some communication app apart from 2 hand gestures there is no in game communication which gives them some coordination advantage i ll just add that it s a good idea to play as both killers and survivors learning strengths of the enemy can definitely help i havent really ran into any major bugs so far 130hrs there is a ranking system kinda broken as it requires tremendous amount of work to progress and i m kinda reaching the limit here i had fun for over 100 hours there is still plenty to unlock microtransaction system deserves commendation you can unlock most dlc characters can be unlocked with in game currency iridescent shards for profile leveling or just their perks on weekly changing shrine of secrets 4 random perks per week 2 for survivors 2 for killers premium currency only for cosmetics some can be bought with shards all in all i m having fun
