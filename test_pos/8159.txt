2019 early access review game of incredible capacity to make any situation crazy and enjoyable but also insanely difficult as a trade off noita a game with the best physics every part of the level can be interacted with by that i mean destroyed melted frozen set ablaze and so on every enemy can be smashed shocked buried frozen burned chopped you name it but so can you noita is a rewarding experience when something works out and it can be rewarding even when it does not but at the end of the day its fun either way or so i think positives physics literally anything can be used or effected in some way magic system wands that can have any kind of spells on them and can be edited to do spells that you want or find some shoot arrows some cause an earthquake some just summon a rain cloud magical flasks with weird properties stretching from simple water to literal polymorphing agent enemies range from small spiders big ones as well and zombies to robots hunters with rocket launchers and mages and anything that has hands can use wands as well making it interesting when a zombie decides to summon a lighting bolt in your face by accident levels each lair has its own troubles and interactions perks range from basic health increase to immunity to fire to making you a vampire negatives game can be crazy easy from the start or instant death from the start rng is a blessing and a curse more on that later since you a wearing clothes any liquid can stick to you and it can be an issue in a long term unless you obtain a perk to limit that no way to effect your start gear no real progression beyond finding things randomly be it spells or wands or health games strength is the ability to make any situation work and biggest weakness is in the rng of everything it can bless you with some awesome starts like a thunderbolt wand and immunity to electricity perk in the first portal with no extra effects or can send 2 fire elementals at you for you to die by or make 2 out of 3 portals be in lava pits or make acid eyeballs smack you at the start with no water around you the point is the game is in my opinion a bit uncontrollably rng based experience let me explain to me dead cells for example does something to create options to work towards you save up cells to trade in for an start upgrade to have random choices for 3 weapons 1 from each type you have unlocked this limits your start rng by a lot making the run more depend on you the game is rng based but you can manage it as you have options in noita that is not the case whatever the game decides goes you will get f ked a lot just because the games said so it happens even when you do nothing a worm can piss of the gods and the gods will try to kill you because a worm you had no idea was there destroyed their altar somewhere so they send a undead mage to expand your innards outwards just because sometimes the game gives you a wand with thunder shock bolts amazing you think they are fun and super satisfying to use unless you are not electricity immune and one out of 3 shots might shoot bolts around you blowing shocking yourself final thoughtsoverall its a game i love because of the potential i see in it but its a game that i can t even finish once that s what i do before i write a review of a game and most likely won t until i ll get lucky i enjoy it a lot but i feel like to make it a massive success like enter the gungeon or dead cells you need to look at some aspects of those games mainly progression and control of your start and incorporate your twist of those ideas into the game if you want to have a fun time with the most satisfying mage combat lighting bolt game on the gaming market and you want to support game developers that actually give a damm about making a good and enjoyable and unique game then get noita small improvements that would be amazing 1 i feel like the randomness should be more controllable at the start or at least give players more options at the start create a small village outside the cave with free wands or spells to use or make a system with unlocks to give you something to go towards to make future runs more controllable 2 make npc random destruction not anger the gods towards you its a hard fix i assume considering that npc s can be made to help you but would be fun not to be killed because a worm just wanted to eat a perk 3 add mini customization for your mage makes people get attached to their little meat slime explosion piles
