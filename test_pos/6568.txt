as a warframe veteren with over 3000 steam hours on it i recommend this game i m editing this to update my review now that ive completed the main story and am now at the games current end game which is just hard mode the short version of my review stays basically the same this is a 3rd person game that feels similar to destiny but with warframe leveling crafting and modding systems it has a season battlepass and mid tier monetization decent in some areas and bad in others to start in depth with the monetization i will say its poor in areas like crystal catalysts warframe forma energy transistors warframe reactors and rushing builds but have relatively similar pricing for skins and ultimate decendant bundles similar to warframes prime access i will point out that decendent bundles dont come with as much goodies as warframes bundles do but the pricing is similar i will note that i have played other nexxon games before so im familiar with their pricing and from what ive seen of them before this game is relatively fair for them gameplay wise as i said in my pre edited review it plays alot like destiny does with the open world zones and destiny patrol style missions and dungeons strikes then it has some instanced colossus boss battles the gunplay and powers feel unique and different enough and each purple gun or higher tier has substats that can be obtained so you can find your personal favorite god roll somewhere or reroll it yourself with a craftable resource and each character has unique abilities that impact the way you deal with ads and bosses in their own ways also in my pre edit i touched on my one big negative of the game and that is the voice acting since i made my last edit i ran into more issues like a cutscene where my least favorite eng dub voice actor in the guide frequently had her voicelines cut out halfway through and my friends had the same issue some of the actors i enjoy like yujin s va and valby s va but a lot of them are not that great or mid at best the writing is decent but im assuming leaves a lot of mysteries on purpose since this is literally update 1 0 but still the eng dub is hot garbage in the grand scheme with some good ones here and there and now for my newest part of my post edit where i talk about the grind until i beat the main story i was kinda worried the game was going to force you towards paying the outrageous price on this games versions of forma and reactors however with the sheer ease that you can grind amorphs once you get to hard mode alleviated all my fears your garanteed to get an amorph with every dungeon as long as you dont wipe with the scoring system which have the blueprints for your forma reactors characters and weapons there is a litte bit of tedium with encrypted vaults but ive played year 1 destiny so chest runs are a normal grind for me also once you get to hard mode all gear will drop at lvl 100 which so far is the max and you can lvl your weapons to that and grind away and lastely what seems to be the biggest grind is lvling and resetting your favorite guns and characters as well as upgrading their mods but this is a similar challenge that new warframe players also have to go through so its not to much different of a challenge but it is the only thing holding me back from steamrolling the rest of the content right now but thats just how a looter shooter rolls
