2021 sea of thieves is fun for all ages i m 36 years old my parents are in their 50s and my children are 10 and 12 we all play sea of thieves the graphics are gorgeous and the environment immerses you in to the pirate life the game has story line aspects with its tall tales or you can get voyages to kill off captain skeletons battle skeleton and ghost ships find lost merchandise in sunken ships or good old fashion treasure hunting there are world events that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleets skeleton forts fire tornadoes that spawn in boss enemies and the infamous flameheart and his ghost fleet i find the game has a good balance of pve and pvp so you are able to attack player ships and vice versa plus during your voyages surprise attacks from megladons krakens and even a skeleton ship can attack this game keeps you on your toes and wanting more i highly recommend it
