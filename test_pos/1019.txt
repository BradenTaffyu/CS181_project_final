2023 elden ring is a delicious late afternoon wine and cracker platter under a sweltering sun cooled by a spring breeze and relaxing backyard music the wine the good of elden ring it is intoxicating addicting aromatic and fruity yet aged to perfection the cracker the difficulty it is hard rough gritty and perhaps a little tough to bite through heck some of the crackers on this platter are so stiff and unpalatable it could be hardtack but there is no such crunch in elden ring and these crackers that cannot be overcome by lathering on a thick layer of cream cheese how much cheese you apply to your cracker is up to you but what you ll come to learn is that there is no right way to enjoy this wine we all have our own idea of how much cheese we like some enjoy so much cheese that the cracker becomes obscured perhaps there might as well not be any some enjoy their crackers dry to compliment the complex blend of the wine as was intended in either case you will find how you like your game and enjoy it
