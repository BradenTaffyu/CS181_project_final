2020 grand theft auto v is a game that exceeded all of my expectations from the moment i started playing i was hooked the open world map of los santos is massive and filled with a wide variety of activities to keep players engaged for hours on end whether you re driving around the city causing chaos participating in high stakes heists or just taking in the sights and sounds of the game s many neighborhoods there s always something to do the graphics in the game are top notch and the attention to detail is impressive the city feels alive with traffic and pedestrians going about their business and the lighting and weather effects add a realism that immerses you in the game the character models and animations are also incredibly well done making the game feel like a living breathing world one of the things that sets gta v apart from other open world games is the level of freedom it gives players you can choose to play as one of three characters each with their own unique story and abilities and you can switch between them at any time this adds a level of replayability to the game that is unmatched the heist missions are also a standout feature of the game planning and executing large scale robberies with your crew is incredibly satisfying and the game s cover based shooting mechanics make for some intense and exciting action in short grand theft auto v is a masterpiece of a game it has something for everyone whether you re looking for a sandbox to cause chaos in a story to follow or just a beautiful open world to explore the level of freedom and replayability is unmatched and the attention to detail is stunning it s a game that i will keep coming back to for years to come
