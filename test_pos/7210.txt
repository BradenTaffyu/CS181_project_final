i was really on the fence if i should give a recommendation or not on this game this is probably both one of the best and most frustrating gaming experiences i have ever had at the same time i don t think i have experienced a product that is so impressive and at the same time so sloppy i absolutely adore the first dragons dogma and i actually replayed it again just prior to starting up dragons dogma 2 upon playing the first dragons dogma i reflected again over how incredible immersive your companion pawns where in how they commented on things in the environment in a context dependent manner after playing dragons dogma 2 though it is just so frustrating to feel like the pawn behavior is a huge step back from the first game they constantly repeat the same dialogue lines over and over and over again and most of it is even nonsense and non helpful like telling you for the 1000 time that you can combine stuff when you are 100 hours into the game and have already done this 1000 times before i keep saying shut the up in annoyance constantly this never ever happened in the first game even after playing 100 hours and they never annoyed me it is really insufferable how much they repeat the same lines over and over again i also find that there is much less context dependent comments on unique environmental features like in the first game but that is less of an issue when compared to the constant nag also even the context of when they speak is extremely sloppy many times i make camp and 3 seconds after having camped some pawn makes a comment on how we probably are not in need of camping just now or they ask if i need guidance to a cave when i stand 1 meter from the opening of it it is constant and incredibly annoying it is such a shame because the game is incredible immersive in most other aspects but this completely and utterly ruin all that illusion of an immersive real world with these pawns there are other issues with the game but for me this is really the main gripe repeating dialogue is really an immersive killer in most games but it is really critical here since having the pawns behave in a natural manner is such a big part of the game and something that was really nailed in the first game and such an unique feature of what that game was and how it stood out from other just implementing some cooldown on how often dialogue can repeat would go a long way to making the pawns feel less fake and artificial which is the complete opposite of what should be the goal here the game really feels like some masterpiece painting by a great artist and then some clowns come in and throw faeces all over it the repeating dialogue almost single handedly takes one of the most immersive worlds i have seen in a game and completely demolish it anyhow that is my main gripe some other pros and cons though pros extremely beautiful graphics with amazing looking animations no loading between areas or going into towns or dungeons etc beautiful music when exploring good controls and characters have a sense of physics to their movement quests are not entirely hand holding like in most other games and sometimes you actually have to think for yourself no cheap quick travel and like in the first game the quick travel system is actually implemented in the game world especially love how when you throw a ferrystone up in the air and it hits a roof it fails to trigger in game logic increases believability and immersion in he game world though i understand if it can be a bit constraining to some players and probably they nerfed the portalstones etc to be able to sell them as microtransactions bad nice system i have not seen before where many quest givers actually initiate conversation with you in a natural manner as you go near instead of having a system with fake looking markers above their head like in most other games elves in this game actually look like how elves are supposed to look like great character creator and from my understanding some of the actual physical elements of your character like their height and weight determine movement speed to some extentcons again the repeating dialogue of the pawns almost destroy the game but enough said about that the game has performance issues especially in cities and even dlss does not seem to make much of a difference microtransactions dungeon cave design are really really really repetitive and are only caves really in different sizes one of the best aspects of the original dragons dogma was how incredible good the level design was in some of the dungeons with atmospheric elements like flowing streams in the floor or just a huge sense of detail both in design and soundscape to some of them the lack of variety in dungeons and locations really hurt the sense of wonder and exploration as when you have seen the first cave you have pretty much seen them all difficulty is really trivial and most of the time it feels like just swapping annoying flies when dealing with the enemy mobs except for some of the huge ones that are more bullet sponges until you have the equipment for them having pretty much infinite potential for healing with items does not help with quick buttons that just refills your health instantly without even needing a drink or eat animation etc just destroy all aspects of any difficulty the developers should really look at implementing something more akin to how healing is handled in dark souls elden ring the permanent reduction of healing that needs to be refilled by sleeping is a good feature though imo the sound mixing is atrocious and probably the worst i have ever seen heard you have to constantly adjust the volume down or up as you get your ears blown out with the combat music in battle that drowns out all other sound mobs of enemies are placed way to frequent in the game world which just feels fake and artificial and you can barely move a step until there is another group of enemies are on you because the difficulty is so trivial they more become an annoyance than something that feels like a treat as you try to traverse around the environment enemies also respawn way to frequent it would be nice to actually be able to clear out areas especially in the routes of the oxcarts to make travel easier without getting jumped by enemies it feels like enemies respawns in areas after just a day when really it should be after a week ingame at the least capcom made human pawns are incredibly ugly and just look unfitting to the game it does not help that for some reason like half of all the names are not matching the genders of the characters so you will have males named lisa or sofia and females named peter and gregory etc while the initiation of dialogue is a great thing for quest givers etc this is also used on pawns you meet on the road and they interrupt you with a conversation if you get to near which can be extremely annoying the game has incredible vistas with huge mountains so it is a massive bummer to discover that much of it has invisible walls that prevents you from going to many places not a fan how shopkeepers stand in place 24 7 even at night some more routine in their behavior would be welcome and having closed at night etc the feature of having to have a pawn that understands elvish and that can interpret to the player as they speak would be an incredible original idea if implemented right imagine as an elf speaks in a foreign language to the player and your pawn conveying what is said to you in real time it would be really unique idea that would enhance the believability of the game world however how this was implemented in the game just flushed all that potential down the toilet by just having what they say in text if you have a translator and you even have to go to options to turn subtitles on if you have them off or you will not even see what they say anyway word count reached
