2022 what is the situation i started participating in the warhammer series since the beginning of warhammer 2 i pre ordered warhammer 3 since i was so excited for a big new game to have a comparison of performance i have added my pc specs at the end of the review so let s get on with the review i have split the review into several categories i have played the prologue and started a multiplayer cathay campaign with a friend of mine performance is solely based on the fps and loading time gameplay glitches and bugscontent the new stuff1 performancei took notice that there has been a huge complaint about performance optimization issues however i can not relate to these problems even though my rig is not superior specs at the end of the review i can still easily play the game at medium graphics with 60 fps in battles but due to my game being installed on the hard drive loading times have gone up quite some bit i would approximate about 2 to 4 min loading time for transitioning from a battle to the campaign map and vise versa i have not had the game crash on me yet 2 gameplayat first glance there seem to be no issues whatsoever however over 6 hours of playing i did encounter a couple of odd things happen these are all in the category of annoying in my humble opinion grand cathay have the ability to use the ivory road to trade around the world during the travels of such a caravan many events can happen in my case i got ambushed by a small ogre army which would have been easily beat however due to bad luck when i clicked on fight a sudden second army joined due to this i lost my caravan the speculations are that at the location of the attack a second army was located that got dragged in to the fight during this ogre fight i encounter another weird possible bug when a wall of halberdiers were defending the frontline they seemed to be useless allow me to explain when a unit clashed with my static halberdiers half of that clashing unit was allowed to move through my entire unit without any trouble this caused my unit to be surrounded and my archers behind to be in trouble i can not say for certain if this is a bug or a new feature flying units can not be ordered a flying unit to move above a unit it will always relocate your move order beyond the ground units this does not seem to bad until you are using units that have the ability to drop a bomb right beneath them this caused for a minor inconvenience where i had to fly the unit over the clashing armies and press backspace to hold the unit in the right place 3 content the game has added a lot of new content to the total war warhammer franchise kislev grand cathay the chaos factions of tzeentch khorne slaanesh and nurgle and the ogre kingdoms i have yet to play the chaos or ogre kingdom factions however i have played grand cathay thus this review will be more focussed on the grand cathay features 3 1 mapthe game has also added more features to the game such as region trading quick deal in the diplomacy tab this greatly increases the efficiency of making diplomacy and prevents you from asking every faction for a trade agreement to which afterwards you are trying every possible money gift for the deal to work only to find out that they were note interested in a deal after all instead you can see which factions might be interested in a particular deal and you can use the balance button to get or give the right amount of money to let the deal work they also implemented a better public order system this system stimulates growth on higher public order and reduces growth on negative public order the multiplayer campaign mode is really neat to work with all the players work in the same turn to which it is possible to play with more than just 2 people if you have some moral in your group of friends than this system should work just fine basic rules such as first do all the management of your kingdom diplomacy building and recruiting and at the end make people move their units and attack this greatly reduces the time for each player to wait 3 2 fightsthe new map looks stunning and the new siege map mechanics are great instead of having a single wall that you have to climb which gets repetitive quite quick the siege maps are more stunning and usually have multiple sides to enter the city the defender has the ability to create barricades and towers before and during to fight this makes siege fights a lot more difficult and interesting to fight and the last very notable thing is that the ai has improved a lot an ai army with war hounds actually uses these hounds to properly flank you and take out your archers the ai is clever in scenarios where it might get a backup army after a couple of minutes instead of rushing in they move back to wait for the other backup army to meet them 4 to concludethe game certainly has a few bugs here and there but i would not say that these inconveniences outweigh the new content the games looks great even on medium has amazing new features and has made battles a lot more interesting due to the better ai and the reworked siege fights since they will still be updating the game a lot optimizing and bug glitch fixing i feel like they do not get enough credit for what an amazing game they have managed to make reviews saying that it has become normal to release games that are bugged beyond playing are lying through their teeth the game is not beyond playing some bugs just cause minor inconveniences i am not implying that every bad comment on the game is unjustified i certainly believe that people have had major issues such as not getting the game to work beyond 20 fps and possible other issues however this is my perspective on the game after playing it for 6 hours just after release 5 my pcit is an 8 year old pc that back in the day was quite high end however in these days not so much anymore currently i run all my games on a 8 year old rig with the following specs processor intel i5 4690k
