2022 i know this game has gotten glowing reviews but no one said it was addicting it s so refreshing playing something that is not coddling or holding my hand feels like old school gaming btw if you re having issues with crashes what worked for me was uninstalling geforce experience and playing it in borderless windowed mode unfortunately you can t use hdr but better than crashing randomly
