2021 6 10 i recommend you buy this game at a deep sale an online shooter that can be very fun and different from your typical online shooters by giving the player different options and styles to play with you can have a lot of fun in this this game trying new operators and changing the way you play getting better by learning to do things differently most of the guns sound and feel really good which is really important in this kind of game game looks alright it s not the best looking game out there but it s good enough and after more than 500 hours playing it yes i will recommend you to try this game but there are some things you need to know first game runs fine performance wise but there are some issues like some graphical glitches that can only be fixed by restarting the game and some crashes here and there but nothing too major there are some things that are big issues at least for me like every time there is a new update i see more and more people having longer and longer load times before a match and the match cannot start until everyone s game is fully loaded this was not as much an issue a year ago yet it gets worse day by day you would think that they have a complete understanding of how the game works after so many years of development by now as someone who has played this game once or twice a week for a few years a lot of the times it feels like the developers are more interested in the new content then fixing the existing issues new content is always good and welcome but not when there are so many issues that makes the game less fun you can also get all of the new operators with in game money which is really cool now it might take you a thousand hours to farm enough money to get all of them but the option is there if you enjoy the game and don t want to pay more money why not when you play this game as the way it should be played in my opinion working with your team to defeat the enemy who is working with their team to win the game this game is really fun but at this point in almost 70 of the games i play there is one guy who tries to play solo and by that i mean they will try to kill the whole enemy team by themselves same goes for the enemy team as well and whether they succeed or not they will do one thing and that is ruining the game for everyone else who at least tries to play it the right way you as a player surely don t just want to win a game by doing nothing on the other hand you also don t want to do everything so that no one else can enjoy these little moments that makes the game fun maybe its like this for me at this point and at the higher levels people play like this i surely don t enjoy it but still if i had fun until this point hey i got 400 hours of fun out of it and if you can get at least a 100 hours enjoying it you get more than you paid for
