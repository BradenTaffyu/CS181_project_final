2021 it s the sort of a game where you get told how to move your character and that s it for tutorialit s a rogue like game but where you can t upgrade different things in between the runs like in rogue legacy unlocking new classes or buffs or new starting items like in isaac no it s a game where you die you lose everything the only thing you ve earnt is a bit more knowledge about the game it s a game where you walk up to an empty shrine where you re supposed to find a wand think to yourself aw man the heck some shrines spawn empty and then outta nowhere a giant saw disc flies into you butchering you for more than half of your hpafter what you learn that enemies may equip your weapons if they find them first it s the game where you find out that some enemies bleed lava instead of blood by dying to a corpse which suddenly started acting like a beautiful lava fountain sprinking orange liquid of death and pain everywhere around itit s the sort of a game where you learn that some enemies explode after most likely dying to them cause you didn t see them shoot stuff so you let them come too close it s the sort of a game where where you can spend over 50 hours in it start a new game thinking that well damn i spend so much time in this stuff surely i won t die like a dumbass cause of a silly mistake forgetting that the dungeon might spawn one of the toughest flying monsters in game on the first floor of the dungeon just because or perphaps a shotgunner who d die in 1 shot from your magic wand broke a polymorph potion while shooting at another enemy transformed into a magical worm monster from the last stage of the game and spooked the hell out of you literally and of course we can t forget about you simply walking into the dungeon and seeing you have angered the gods wondering what the heck does that meanand then getting slaughtered like a pig in a butcher house by a spooky flying skeleton with a magical shield which repels all your projectiles and who can spam slightly homing magical fireballs at the same time cause game spawned worms and they decided to ignore the worm crystal and ruin the holy mountain it s a game where you spawnand sometimessomething already explodes in the mines underneath youit s a game where you can complete a normal run in around 16 first hours of the gamethen remember that you can eat enemy s corpsesand decide bruh screw that boss for almost killing me i ll show it that i eat such creatures for breakfast literally i ain t going into no final portals till i devour its whole corpse and then you learn that you can explode by overeating ruin your best run so far and fail to reach the final boss in the next 20 hoursit s a game where you can get victory achievement after spending 70 hours in it just like i did and yet ya d be proud of it 11 10 not enough deaths cause of shooting lightning into an enemy and hitting liquid that flew from above at that moment making it explode in your own ass insteadthe game is pretty fun and enjoyable albeit it takes a bit of time to get into it and learn the mechanics however once you get into it you can truly enjoy them due to various perk combinations or wand tinkering letting you put the spells you yourself want to see onto the best wand you can find i for one truly enjoy the beauty of perks making dead enemies turn into friendly rats and mushroom kamikazesgives you a tiny weenie bit of that necromancer feelingwhich is exploitable as well since the creatures you summon this way can spawn more creatures if you kill them yourself before enemies get them can t say that this game is without cons however which are pretty much what i ve mentioned above for me the game may decide that you are having too much of a blast and spawn almost unkillable enemies at the start due to weird algorythm enemies may steal wands from shrines and then you could just fail to find them cause they d die somewhere near sand or lava and drop it into themor they may simply annihilate you cause duh you have a starting wand and they get some ultra harry potter stuff the game plays itself as well especially with perks for more hatred between enemies and sometimes it gets angry at you for not restarting the run after hearing some quakes since worms can eat through terrainand the most important con of all for some people perphapseven after reading the wiki and guides i still don t get what some things do still i highly recommend this game if you re a fan of random dungeon generation and explosions
