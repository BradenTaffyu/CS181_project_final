2021 currently the best pirate game on the market sea of thieves managed to scratch that itch i ve had for a while i was looking for a game that allowed me to relax after work but still engage me enough to get my adrenaline pumping i truly understood that i am a 30 year old who is jumping in a game mostly populated by people younger than myself the guy i play with a 13 y o kid from america i dubbed battlesquirrel for good reason screechy high on energy has the focus and memory of a squirrel i freaking love it sea of thieves has an edge though not a lot of players will understand or find confusing its you and your crew versus 4 other boats versus the world most players won t bother you while you do quest a few of them will attack anything that moves there is no game mode where this isn t the case you will always play on servers that will host players that are out to get you that is literally what you sign up for and if you play smart you can outplay them you can also take high risks to earn high rewards but again people are out to get you always meaning yes you can play for 5 hours get killed and lose everything you worked hard for for 5 hours if you can t stand that type of thrill knowing you can lose it all this game won t be for you if you like fishing killing skeletons and beating megalodons without players trying to sink you this game won t be for you so what keeps you motivated the game doesn t have loot in the sense of hundreds of weapons everything evolves around skins that show what you have done and indirectly how good you are the damage from all weapons are the same as that of another player this game is 100 skill if you need lineair progression to feel motivated this game will bore the hell out of you everything you do is to get skins what you need to realize is you play this game shocking to have fun no two runs will feel the same and yes there are leaderboards that reset periodically yet the ultimate goal to become a pirate legend it s just skins and a faction that combines the regular quests into a mix that is it you play for fun and get rewarded with skins you will start to recognize on others in some regard you finished the true tutorial once you hit legend equally after release this game was very bare bones right now season 1 going into season 2 the game feels very fleshed out three factions that focus on world events similar to a profession a risky pvp faction that literally marks you on the map for everyone to see find or flee from and a couple of other factions the biggest selling point is that there won t be a single encounter with players that feels the same and believe it or not the game is actually balanced quite well knowing your strengths and accepting your weaknesses yes a 4 player 8 cannon galleon can be beaten by a 2 player sloop with 2 cannons but if you go up against similarly skilled players the galleon will be stronger in many situations managing to sink one in your tiny maneuverable little sloop very very memorable right now the game knows 2 game modes adventure and arena arena are shorter fights with up to 4 other boats in which you fight other crews for points the goal being to hit other boats for points sink them to make them lose points deliver a chest to a central dropping zone to get a large chunk of points the goal being the boat with the most points when the timer ends it truly teaches you to fight and sink other ships fast adventure is the main gamemode the game is all about you get access to the entire worldmap and you share this world with currently 4 other boats everyone doing their own thing some fight skeleton ships some fight forts some are getting chased my giant megalodon sharks some are out to hunt other players battlesquirl and i are the latter we actively look for fights but we honor the code to leave beginners alone when we notice they are struggling to defend themselves this gamemode allows for the most interaction and rarely feels repetitive playing for 5 8 hours in a row without sinking once having sunk 10 other ships it s great until you meet that one pro boat that server hop until they find a server with players like yourself and go straight for you sink you and sell the loot you worked hard for for hours by sinking others karmaso what are the downsides really to start with this game can be played solo but i wouldn t recommend it completely possible but the game isn t designed for that type of playstyle you earn less money and can t sell as fast you are both the captain cannoneer and repairman and you cannot do all at once against any decent crew you won t stand a chance but it s not impossible another thing to remember is this game s adventure mode doesn t allow for short sessions i d say you need at least 3 hours of playtime to get a decent session if you have a friend that wants to join you mid game that is troublesome because the loot on your boat isn t saved it resets when you die it resets when you log out if you need to switch boats you basically reset your progress if you have a friend that leaves mid adventure you cannot downgrade ships without losing your progress you only keep the money you earned by selling your loot another point is a skill gap you will notice once you start getting good there are players that literally join and leave servers systematically until they find a server that hosts what they want to do this cherry picking playstyle can be and will feel very unfair generally really good players that spawn go in a straight line towards you sink you do steal and or finish the event you started sell it and switch to another server server hoppers are a real thing and even though i understand their arguments it s an unfair pain in the pirate cave major events like fort of the damned need a long time to prepare you have this fun but very long fight only to find out a server hopper waited on the edge for 30 minutes doing nothing but wait until you finished it to sink you sell your loot and jump to the next server doing the same there currently is no penalty for this join and leave behavior in the game it makes your own triumphs feel hollow when you are literally wasting your time doing the work for others who don t even bother to invest some time into a server i don t mind losing to good players that have been lurking our sea s for 2 hours i do mind if they only pick your server because of the event you are doing it s sea of thieves not sea of teleporting universe hoppers who steal baseline get this game if you want to play pirate with lots of random events memorable runs and a very high replayability don t get this game if you need to feel rewarded for every action you make it s a true game not an addiction machine made to keep you engaged
