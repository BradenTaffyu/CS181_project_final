2023 my 18 year old ask me to reinstall the game and in doing so i noticed that i had yet to review the game we have at the time of this review over 320 hours play time on the pc with nearly double that on the ps4 funny thing is that we have never even completed the story campaign or played on the online portion the vast majority of the time was just my daughter and i making tons and tons of mayhem well more me making the mayhem and her going on joy rides for years now she has asked me when gtva 6 was coming out and she was so glad to hear that it was finally coming out in a couple more years i don t care what people say i am glad for her that she will finally have a female anti hero to play as in the past we have always modded the game just so she could play as a female character i tire of people saying a game is woke just because it has a female lead grow up and get with the current century is what i have to say and i am in my fifties so it isn t like i am a millennial or gen z saying this if you don t like the character being female do the opposite of what we did and mod the character to a male anyway it is amazing how much fun this game is just driving around and sightseeing even after all these years the game still holds up as a decent looking game rockstar put heart and soul into the game and it shows by the way if you ever get a chance to meet steven ogg voice of trevor in real life do it the dude is hundred kinds of funny and a cool dude all around
