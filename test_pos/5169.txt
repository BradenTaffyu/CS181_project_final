2023 hi there i am a chinese player i am writing this comment in english because i just want to explain what is going on with r6 these days in china and why ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from chinese players out of sudden of course what i am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding i definitely do not mean to represent all chinese players for the record i am not really fond of pvp like games but i still bought the complete version of rainbow six siege part of the reason as you all know is for the green discount mark made by fatty g chinese nickname of gabe newell for another part of the reason is about the topic that i am going to address first we shall start with some background information about a chinese company called tencent as you may already know wechat and qq are two of tencent s most famous products for you guys who don t you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages from my personal view i d say four out of five chinese people use wechat and or qq so that makes a billion letting alone foreigners these two products bring quite a lot of convenience to chinese people yet tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in chinese internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation so basically video game is its most heated debating part there are still a lot of chinese people however spending their wages in tencent games as they curse its unfairness why i think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon the first reason from my humble understanding relates to chinese social structure the middle classes make the most part in chinese society while it may seem to be natural to some countries it brings problem in china due to the large population and limited resources chinese people have to compete with each other at schools we compete for the access to better educations at companies we compete for higher salaries at governments we compete for stronger power time for me to shut up as a result winners are few and losers makes the major so when it comes to games many in case of misunderstanding i dare not to use the word most but i really want to chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game like spending money in the pay to win games which most tencent games are based on like cheating methods again i personally feel sorry for what s happening in pubg although i barely play it and i do not cheat for the record i just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding i do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat the second reason is basically like what is happening to nba 2k 18 it receives only less than 30 positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they ve seen the bad comments which means a monopoly is happening here right steam is like a shadow region in china so literally it is not a legal platform in the mainland of china using this convenience tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games for instance call of duty series we chinese people cannot reach the access to its steam store because of tencent and what is worse tencent itself launched a game called call of duty online and when it comes to online you should know that it is a game that is for free to play but costs to win you ve got to pay for stronger weapons i mean it is still ok if you pay for skins right but since it is a fps competitive game i do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons it is bound to break the balance of the game similar things happened in need for speed online you pay for faster cars to beat other players and naruto online you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players not to mention numerous tencent self made games pay to win is everywhere and now ubisoft china has just announced that tencent got the dealership of r6 chinese r6 players began to worry they are worried about whether they will be region locked they are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken it should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to r6 in china is still unknown thus it is to some extent unfair for ubisoft to receive so many negative comments yet it is important for ubisoft to pay more attention to chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don t want it to become the next online product of tencent thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad english if you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections please feel free to discuss
