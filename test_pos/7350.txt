alright i m going to cut through all the bull about muh microtransactions or muh one save files or muh performance and i m going to give you the most honest review that i can the microtransactionsi m going to get the biggest elephant in the room out of the way first we ve all seen a lot of complaints over this with not much context backing this up so the microtransaction dlc stuff you see on the store page is all stuff you can acquire within the first hour or two of playing the game wakestones rift crystals the ability to reset your character s appearance you can get all that stuff within the first couple hours i ve honestly never seen a series of microtransactions so utterly pointless to buy since well to be honest the first dragon s dogma yeah you heard me right the first dragon s dogma in fact capcom seems to have gone to some lengths to directly copypaste the ddda mtxs and they were just as pointless there too as for the presentation there is none none of it s remotely in your face at all now that i ve established that the dreaded microtransactions are the most pointless purchases known to man let s move on to something a bit weightier and if this is still a dealbreaker i m sorry but i m also glad we got it out of the way early performanceokay yeah this one s actually a solid negative from me i can run most games of similar graphical fidelity at a solid 60 80 fps on max settings or near enough dragon s dogma ii struggles to make 30 on medium high for me that being said i m also a former console player so i don t really care that much as long as the framerate is consistent which dd2 can usually accomplish unless it s loading in graphic intensive areas in which case i drop to 15 20 for a few seconds if that s a dealbreaker well i m sorry but i m also glad we got it out of the way now one save slotyeah it s a bummer but it was also present in the first game so i don t know what to tell you here story gameplayi m going to lump this all into one category here sorry about that it s just how i m rolling i m not gonna sugarcoat it this game is ddda but bigger meatier and with the names and some of the small details changed around that s it it s not a sequel unless there s some hidden boss 80 hours in or something it s a remake i honestly blame the marketing team here that being said i really can t say anything more than what i already did it s ddda with moderate to large improvements across the board if you liked the first game you ll probably like this one unless any of the above categories were dealbreakers if you didn t like the first game there probably won t be much to recommend with this one the voice acting is moderately improved from the first game we ve gone from an average and serviceable 4 5 5 5 10 to a decent but not outstanding 6 5 7 10 in that regard the dragon continues to be awesome the dialogue continues to be presented in a somewhat archaic syntax delivery that most people seem to be annoyed by but i find oddly charming the core gameplay is essentially the same as the first game from what i can tell but hey if it ain t broke why bother fixing it the story is the names and faces are different but the broad strokes seem to be the same there s still the big capital city about halfway down the eastern shoreline on the map except this time you start in the north instead of the south but the broad strokes are similar enough to where i was able to map my progress by comparing the ddda quest progression i e oh yeah a quest here was just x quest from ddda so b quest here will probably fill the same role as y quest from the first game and so far that s been essentially borne out final verdicti like it solid buy glad i got it that being said i m fully aware of what made me like the game might turn other people off but if you liked ddda and nothing of what i typed here is a turnoff for you dd2 is probably worth checking out dd2 is ddda but bigger and better and i can high five my pawn sometimes and that s all i really wanted out of another dragon s dogma game but if you don t like that i completely understand
