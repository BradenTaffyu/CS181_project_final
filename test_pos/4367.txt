2019 after playing it for 92 days on xbox and now 300 some odd here on steam i gotta say warframe is a pretty good game could it be better yes but you can say that about any game in the world now that doesn t mean i don t think warframe needs imporvements like the constant content drought that happens with the game or the fact that many updates and new additions to the game are more so tailored to new players rather than adding true end game content that the veterans that have been playing for thousands and thousands of hours desperately need rather than having to go in and see how long they can make it in a survival because they have simply ran out of things to grind for at a certain point but even still i always find myself returning to warframe as a person who normally doesnt enjoy the full hard grind mmo action style games because at a certain point i get bored of the repetitive nature of them and want to move onto something else but warframe has and continues to be a game that breaks that trend for me as i started playing back in 2014 after a friend who played the game on pc told me about it and i figured i d give it a shot and from there the game had managed to hook me with its flowing movement system diverse roster or frames and weapons that you can play with and the overall level of freedom and power the game lets you feel and while you can feel the grind while you are working towards increasing your mastery rank or trying to farm out that last 1000 plastids to get a new weapon it still feels satisfying to do so simply because even though the mission type are generally quite similar the weapons and combat of the game are just fun to play with whether you run around with a big ass sword and cut down people from the waist or you use a weapon with the dreaded self damage just so you can see your enemies get blown sky high or you use a punch through tonkor because you want to use an explosive weapon but you don t want to actually use an explosive weapon its all fun to just around with and see what you can get up to trying out different builds and all of this just cumulates into an experience that is fun to play and refreshing from the normal monotony that is most grinding mmos also de themselves as a company is fantastic providing feedback to their community constantly keeping in touch with us and making sure we know what they are getting up to trying their best to keep us happy so overall i would say its definetly a game to check out and learn more about because it appeals to those that enjoy grind games and those that don t
