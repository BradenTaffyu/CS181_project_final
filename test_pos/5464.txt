2023 greetings i am doodoosack47 hailing from a realm abundant in mischief and eccentricity regrettably my gravest error came to pass when i extended an ill fated invitation of this game to my comrades allow me to elucidate my tale it all commenced on the 7th of june 2023 right after the conclusion of our academic pursuits rejoicing in the arrival of the coveted summer break little did i fathom that this marked the inception of an entirely distinct malevolence unlike any we had encountered before admittedly we did partake in amusement and indeed it was all enjoyable until our troupe attained level 50 at this juncture our lives underwent a notable downturn this game ceased to be merely a diversion rather it metamorphosed into an onerous obligation from personal experience i observed my genuine bonds deteriorating and my cherished companions gradually surrendering their humanity to this all consuming obsession as i pen this narrative i find myself as the sole possessor of an intact conscience contemplating the traumas of our shared past thus i unequivocally assert that within the realm of r6 there are two distinct types of individuals the skilled pie chefs and those who have been overcome the creampied beware when engaging in cooperative play as conflicts and repercussions are inevitable at some point and place it seems i am ensnared in a repetitive cycle where this game appears akin to a relentless 9 5 occupation in vain i endeavor to divert my attention from these harrowing circumstances i have entwined myself in yet this game s allure remains insurmountable its pervasive influence permeates across various digital platforms tiktok snapchat youtube with persistent invitations tormenting me regrettably my circle of friends has lost its diversity now revolving solely around discussions of this game despite my efforts to explore alternative diversions this addiction persists and not even indulging in 4 slurp juices daily grants respite my journey has been riddled with myriad highs and lows yet the cherished memories endure yes the game is undeniably captivating receiving my commendation but it has come at a significant cost game good u should play lmao
