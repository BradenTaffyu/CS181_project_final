2023 6 5 10 top notch game screen performance first class gun animation and exquisite character modeling this next generation call of duty looks so good but the actual playing experience is so disappointing players in the campaign can enjoy a wonderful visual feast but whether it is a painful game experience or a flat story that far lives up to the reputation of the call of duty series the single player game experience is almost disastrous the special operations experience is also quite poor and can t be compared with the previous call of duty modern warfare series i am afraid that every player has their own opinions on the experience of multiplayer games but a large number of campers are probably the most hated and criticized by the majority of players the skill based matchmaking sbmm system introduced this time is also the biggest difference from the previous call of duty games it sacrifices the game experience of some players in exchange for the active number of players the pros and cons of it may remain to be seen i don t have much experience with warzone and the new dmz mode but as far as i know the current warzone and dmz modes are almost full of bugs and the playing experience is very bad the most unbearable things are the bugs and crashes in the game the lighting bug i encountered seriously affected my game experience and the problem of shader optimization restarting almost every time i entered the game also made my game experience very bad it s clear that call of duty modern warfare ii is poorly optimized finally my personal advice call of duty modern warfare ii s single player story is pretty bad and for that buying for the campaign it s best to dismiss it players can easily get bored in multiplayer games and it is better to consider whether they can tolerate a game environment with many campers overall the experience of this game may be quite disappointing whether it is considering the name of the call of duty series or the expensive game price i hope that better optimization and various bug fixes can be performed in future updates
