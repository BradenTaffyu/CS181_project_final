2023 since the release of skyrim on 11 11 11 i have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat build theories crazy beautiful aesthetics and a real sense of accomplishment items dungeons completed etc this game delivers the entire experience in a way i ve never quite seen i m new to the souls like genre and fromsoftware games here are the takeaways for me 1 combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving at first glance it s hard but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice and then more practice the satisfaction is higher than any game i ve played in the last decade the light attacks heavy attacks blocks parrying sprint attacks sneak attacks all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach 2 items in game from armor and weapons to craftables and ashes are each individually potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a build it s rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build 3 open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary yet very exciting every new enemy seen needs to be studied practiced and learned for optimal combat new enemies can be scary as you don t immediately know their capabilities boss fights are hard some more than others and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools or more hp or you git gud roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your hp fp and stamina while in combat the lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger 4 character building is straightforward you level up as you beat enemies and use the runes xp currency as you see fit to either purchase things or level up etc and you can decide what attribute to increase trying new weapons new armors is both fun and interesting the need to knows 1 game won t hold your hand you are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you you will not know exactly what you re doing where you re going or why you are existing 2 everything you see can kill you if you become too careless slow and steady usually is the best method slow is smooth and smooth is fast 3 ashes of war summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand again no hand holding 4 you will ask yourself how in the world am i supposed to ever be able to complete this many many times 5 puzzles and secrets abound exploration and a good memory are key 6 while there is a multiplayer experience pvp and pve it s a bit confusing and from what i ve experienced so far not necessarily mandatory the single player experience is strong with this one i ve spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and i ve barely left the starting area limgrave my nightmares consist of runebears traversing the mist and boss fights i ve been startled pillaged rekt and absolutely confused many times but i wouldn t change any of it i remember the first time i saw a giant i had attack on titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner captain levi it s just a blast an absolute blast the greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt you can feel your ability your reaction time your muscle memory coming more and more into play as you practice and it creates a thrilling experience struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you ve gotten is a very rewarding experience
