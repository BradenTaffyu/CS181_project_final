2018 call of duty black ops series are my most favourite cod games as well as modern warfare series i bought this game is purely for single player campaign and zombie mode personally i had spent more more than 12 hours to finish campaign hardened mode the storyline of this game still not bad and it features high wall run high tech nano machine etc for zombie mode it is definitely worth it to play although i am not a great player with this challenging mode but still very enjoy to play it for multiplayer mode i heard there are a lot of cheaters or hackers used 3rd party cheating tools also one of my friends has been issued a permanent game ban due to his game stats has been altered and damaged by hackers my friend is a victim in this situation since he never involved in cheating so if you want to play multiplayer it is better for you to find your friends to play with you in private lobby do not play with any stranger that you dont know or you will bear the risk to get game ban furthermore if you are interested in hunting achievement then you will have to own full base game zombie chronicle dlc season pass i give overall rate for this game 8 10 if you are seeking achievement guide can go refer guideline in youtube it help you a lot some of achievements are required 3 persons and even 4 persons play together in order to accomplish it good luck in hunting achievement about the pricing of this aaa games it seems like bo3 is overpriced especially deluxe edition one you know what i mean but if you think you cant afford that price then wait until the sales another thing treyach will be releasing cod black ops 4 battlenet on oct 12 after watching reveal trailer of bo4 im very dissapointed because the traditional single player campaign is being cutted and replaced by battle royale mode however zombie games in bo4 sound like promising to me so i will buy it in future also i believe some people have very douby question why activision only sell pc version on blizzard s battle net instead of steam sell bo4 via battle net is much better and 100 secure because nobody can involve in cheating in battle net platform steam anti cheat system is very suck absolutely if you are interested you can go pre purchase it then just hope you won t lost your hype sorry for my bad english anyway hope you can enjoy my review and have an amazing day review updated since june 15 2018
