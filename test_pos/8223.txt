2019 early access review i bought this game the day it release into early access i guess i have to start out with saying this game will not be for everybody being a rogue lite this game will punish you like no other noita has only been out a week in early access now and i have already chalked up 40 hours well worth the 20 i spent and i am still going in games without permadeath i suffer from restart itis so this game is perfect for me the endless replayability is a key selling factor when i made this purchase coupled with the fact the devs have built such a unique engine i wanted to support them i would love to see what else they have in store for it this game is brutal you will die repeatedly i would say a good portion of my deaths were cause by my own doing as well oh this wand has a nuke spell well let s test it then and i m dead ooo this one shoots fancy blades hey these blades make the enemies bleed a lot more perfect for my vampirism perk i scored blade bounces off wall and lands in my skull ouch well i didn t like that wand anyway and i m glad i died i say lying to myself i believe the furthest i had made it was 800m down this game ramps up the difficulty like no other and became a practical bullet hell down that far this game is frustrating at times and i think everytime i closed it out it was me rage quitting and yet i still find myself firing it up again and again it has that one more go feel to it as well just one more venture into the depths you tell yourself but that turns into 5 more ventures because of a few unlucky runs that definitely didn t count oh look at the time i m late for work so if you like rogue lites and pixel graphics ain t a turn off for you then i highly recommend this game i cannot wait to see what it accomplishes in it s early access phase and i look forward to future releases from the noita team thanks boys and girls
