2016 i have changed my review from a negative review to a positive i played for 6 months with friends and had a blast got more than my moneys worth the visuals are fantastic the game play is super smooth clean and fun so i will give bo3 a thumbs up that being said i am a fan of sniping in cod games i always have been and i honestly feel that the more sci fi and futuristic cod goes the more they jazz up the movement mechanics the more they ruin sniping sure sniping still works but the dash jet pack boost mechanics make it so easy to evade snipers i m praying that infinite warfare gets this right don t get me wrong the jet pack boost mechanics are awesome and they work for this game just not for sniping i want to see more cod games with a historical theme just look at how the new infinite warfare trailer went down vox populi
