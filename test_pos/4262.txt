2017 warframe 2013i played warframe when it was in beta over 300 hours of game time and it was fun lots o fun played it so much i burned out and moved onto other games as time passed and talking to friends that still played wf their comment was you are not going to recognize it warframe 2017holy smokes things have changed digital extremes really stuck to their guns and put everything into wf and didn t stop the start of the game begins like dc universe i cringed at that thought until the story pulled it self into warframe and wow what a blast the core of wf gameplay is still there but the over all world of wf has changed for the better much better i m very happy with what has become of wf and highly recommend if you are looking for an online shooter that may be played co op or solo either way wf is a great game check it out
