2023 i have almost 500 deaths and not 1 completed run this guide requires college degree levels of understanding and knowledge and it gives you no information to dwelve into it or its secrets every death is a frustrating mess and while i could have avoided almost all of them the game made sure to punish me severely for daring to interact or understand its world i hate it with passion anyway 10 10 must buy if you like roguelikes
