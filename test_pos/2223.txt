2020 best battle royale game on the market in my opinion it has problems mostly audio issues but it s not bothering me to a point of it being unplayable good characters with fun abilities and cool stories set in the titanfall universe great gunplay with incredible movement possibilities and great feeling of teamwork in trios easily sank around 300hrs into the game on origin and now switched to steam recommended
