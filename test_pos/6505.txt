2016 highly recommend this game not only can most machines these days run it minimum is a gtx 460 but it runs very well too dead by daylight is a really nice take on the killer in a horror movie type of games right now it offers 3 killers and 12 maps in 4 styled areas each map is randomly generated so it s never the same you cant learn the layout as it s impossible the developers have stated that they plan to hand out alot of free dlc as well as paid dlc but here is the best part if you don t have the dlc do not worry as long as someone in your lobby has it then you can play it they arent seperating the playerbase this is what we want in games these days nobody likes being seperated from the others because they arent willing to pay up each killer has their own special perks and traits 1st the trapper brandishing a meat clever the trapper has the ability to place down rusty bear traps over the map if someone steps in it then they must get help from a friend or try to take it off themselves while in this state the trapper can pick them up and put them on a hook to sacrifice them they can also be downed by being hit twice with the weapon then we have the 2nd the hillbilly the hillbilly is based off the chainsaw massacre he has a hammer similar to the trapper s clever but he also has something else his special ability is a chainsaw the chainsaw is an instant down and when activated the hillbilly can only charge straight ahead but is lightning fast it s truly terrifying in game 3rd is my all time favorite the wraith the wraith is a very up being not only can the wraith go invisible but it does not trigger the action music when he is nearby so unless you manage to see him then you wont know but to counter this survivors can listen for creepy bells to know when he is nearby also his weapon is badass now the survivors i can t go into too much detail as i havent played them all but there are 4 survivors and each has a special ability abilities aswell but you only gain access to as you level up some are good at running helping others distracting and more which is awesome the game takes quite a while to get boring as you never know what you are against as survivors but you can also be the killer too and the randomly generated maps are a nice touch and it s very easy to get lost it s filled with tense moments should you go save your friend or run for the exit found a flashlight a flashlight is an item ingame you can find which if shined in the kilelrs face can blind and stun them maybe you can distract the killer and have someone else unhook your friend theres alot of choices and things to loom out for i only briefed you on half of the things as i want to get back to playing the game but i hope i gave you a general idea of what the game is about pros randomly generated maps teamwork very fun and forces you to use your brain not graphically intensive but still looks great free content in the future and dlc that doesnt seperate the playerbase and more cons there have been reports of crashing but i personally haven t seen any with my experience in the beta or the full game no friend play against randoms only against other friends but they will add this feature soon
