i love the part when you wait 2 hours for the 30 50 gb update to finish basically every time you wanna play the game no other game has this gamemode i guess it really gives you a valuable lesson of patience which is why i bough this game of course and then to top it off this update you just spent hours waiting for was somehow just for a few skins and other cosmetics of the new battle pass or whatever which is not even part of the game you spent 60 for i think it s seriously some sort of achievement that they have somehow managed to put out this amount of updates without changing anything in the base game it s literally the same experience it was on launch oh and trying to find the original game you bought after launching the game that s one fun gamemode too the main menu is basically a billboard for all the other games published by them the game you bought like a year ago is tucked away at the bottom of this menu which is basically the developers saying why the tf are you still playing that sh t so yeah great game modern warfare 2 2022 i mean which i have to clarify as there s no steam page for it anymore but this call of duty is still the game i launch when i go to play it totally understandable though as it is already 2 years since it was released it doesn t need to be it s own game anymore ps update requires restart
