2023 on my first day sailing my new captained ship i named it maurice we were fighting a skeleton fleet and we re struggling we still have enough resources to sink the skelly galleon but we are definitely struggling as we are playing a sloop the smallest boat with the least firepower then someone came into our ship saying that he s friendly and wanted to help us defeat the skelly ship since he said we ve been struggling a lot we were wary at first but there s something about him that made him so trustworthy it may be because his english is so nice and the way he talks is so friendly and inviting so we decided to trust him and have him at the helm while the rest of us shoot repair our ship the guy came in with a brig which is stationed on the other side of the skelly ship also shooting at the skelly ship long story short we sunk the galleon and tons of treasure float on the sea we haven t seen so much treasure before so we thanked the brig guys for their help and asked them if they wanted to share some of the spoils they declined and asked us to just hook every treasure on our ship we then chatted a bit about how their ship has a glowy red effects on the front taught us about factions in the battle for sea of thieves and had us join the opposing faction our ship now has a glowy blue effect in the front and we got really happy since my ship maurice looks so cool now this is the first time i ve met such nice people on the game i thought as all the people so far have been nothing but hostile to us all the nice people we ve met are either new to the game or are semi retired and they re just helping us out because we seemed new these guys are on a whole nother level we thought one last time we offered them the treasure at least to share since they deserved it they have reaper level 5 emissiary too which would sell really great the conversation roughly goes something like look man thanks a lot for your help feel free to take any treasure from the ship we re happy to share oh really i guess i ll take some then you know what i ll take what everything i thought he was joking i thought that bastard was joking his friend on the ship started shooting cannons at us i tried to jokingly negotiate with him to let us go and we ll drop some treasure for him but he did not budge he dropped our anchor set fire to maurice and sunk our ship we didn t have the chance to fight back since we re still mentally shocked after they killed us he started shaming us by telling us to take one treasure and swim to the closest outpost but i know that that s not worth it anymore told us to alt f4 and instantly rejoin to get all our treasure back i don t know why i didn t even try to fight back at the time and for once in my life i felt like a kid who just stepped out into the real world like a baby who had his lollies taken from him some of the last words he said to me had burned me until this day it s sea of thieves man mental crisis aside game was pretty good 9 5 10 would appreciate pve only mode though
