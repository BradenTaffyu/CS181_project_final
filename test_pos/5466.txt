2015 it was 1 on 1 i was scared he knew where i was and i knew where he was we waited for two whole minutes across the hall from one another while both teams watched i could feel sweat dripping down to my waist i put on my big boy pants took the stairs behind me my c4 was down there i went through the first floor came up on the other side blew up my c4 and slowly crouched walked into the room he was hiding in guarding the hall way i saw the man staring at his drone screen probably scouting the room i was in earlier i could have put a bullet in his head but i waited i grinned and filled his body with a whole magazine of lead
