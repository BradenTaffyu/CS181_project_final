2018 buy this for the singleplayer story it is well worth the price and easily has 100 hours of contents if you don t speedrun the main story the multiplayer has some good content and great contents but that grinding is insane and very much pushing towards micro transactions the public free roam servers are riddled with either greifers hackers or non english speaking people this is a pvp game but the rewards and weapons are unbalanced against the people that spend hours building up to a payday and those that with little efford can ruin their work for a small reward there is a way to avoid those people in public lobbies though look around for it and thank me later
