2015 stole a taco truck while the sun was going down bob seger night moves started playing on the radio 10 10but really there are so many little things about this game that will make you crack up it s worth it just on that alone that s what i love about the gta games walking by people saying ridiculous things finding random easter eggs mowing down people on the sidewalk it s all there if you like gta and haven t played this do yourself a favor and get it it s worth the sixty bucks you also get gta online which i haven t even tried yet because the game itself is so much fun
