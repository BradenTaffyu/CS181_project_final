2022 it d be nice if there was an option in between yes and no for these reviews but i get why theres not at the same time anyway i chose yes for this game because despite the multitude of issues and there are quite a few though personally i think some people are blowing them way out of proportion i still have a lot of fun playing it i only have about 7 hours on steam but i played it a good amount on game pass too i think people were expecting it to have the depth of warhammer 2 at launch which is silly imo because that game had years of dev time after launch to not ramble my honest thoughts are that if you are a casual player you ll enjoy this game if you prefer to play on the higher difficulties without mods and multiplayer give it more time in the oven
