2023 this game really drives how just how god awful my rng is not helped by chat integration i get that it s not mandatory to turn it on but if it s there it s totally mandatory to turn it on so far i ve gotten to be good friends with steve learned that our character is made of gunpowder and found a whole ton of wand combos that don t work but it s fun it s addictive i ve gotten almost nowhere i ve run into bugs where my records reset constantly and aren t keeping track and found that a single unseen pixel can be the greatest enemy as you can get stuck on it still i play it i get a kick out of it and my chat gets a kick out of killing me though the game has been punishing due to my gut reaction of go deeper i m in trouble go down find the portal for safety response vs go up you cleared up there it s safe reactions the art is very simple but very good mechanics aren t really difficult but have enough combinations that it s able to give a deepness every time i play i find a new mechanic such as eating i thought i was filling the bottles faster but i was just drinking the fluids i was standing in i made my character sick by eating veggies and thus i had liquid i could use for fires which was unpleasant but useful so it s fun to have hours into a game and still figuring things out would i like more progress yes would i like some sort of check point system yes but i understand this kind of game doesn t do that really it s just hard to keep visiting the snow biome and getting sniped would probably be easier but my rng just beats me like i owe some cosmic entity money overall graphics are a style i personally find appealing music wasn t mentioned but when the music plays it s a great mix quite jazzy controls are very tight quick responses to clicks and attacks fps or performance is perfectly fine but i have a 12700k with 32 gigs of ram and a 2080 i did have people express concerns about acid but i ve had zero performance issues physics aren t bad when using attacks related to them arcs are okay ish for aiming or working with bounces variations in attacks are pretty wide i find a new spell weapon every time potions add a lot of variations as well for clearing things story what story oddly enough i have a lore aholic in chat who told me about this stuff it s using a ton from finnish lore we are essentially playing baba yaga we can eat anything organic and we are fighting other finnish mythos so finally this is an easy recommendation while i got it on sale it s still definitely worth 20 the built in chat integration alone makes this a great streaming game 95 hours i beat it once on stream with chat against me constantly and summoning steve worms lava and blasting me that didn t count finally beat it again with a wand i want to build again i almost died because the final boss dropped a floor of lava on me but thank goodness for the freeze field perk helping me out along with berserkium holy cow though 95 hours to get through the one i haven t even started on the other bosses yet ran into one at one point that i couldn t hurt with anything i had so i guess the journey continues
