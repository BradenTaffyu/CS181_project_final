2020 sea of thieves is a game with a long history of ups and downs that have shaped what has now become one of my favorite games of all time it s hard to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the 4 years before the closed beta started but to say that what would eventually be released to the public at a full price would shape the reputation of the game for years to come is an understatement despite all efforts rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notionfrom consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business not unlike the initial release of sot i d say that mindset is more than justified i believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game over the past 2 years sot has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love i ve ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in many would say that sort of description already fits games like no man s sky but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes sea of thieves stand out unlike nms progression in sot isn t vertical but horizontal meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play and will not differ from someone like me who has played it for over 1000 hours on the m store version while this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world per session arcade experience the genius behind this design starts making sense every single update the game has received doesn t suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems if rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in this is where that approach really shines new mechanics aren t just one and done features every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic for example the rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game but it s not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings if an island holds many treasures a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you re in a hurry which you will be if your ship sinks your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands effectively cutting supply gathering time in half this doesn t even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well for example the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which if you have it docked on your ship allows for an entirely new grappling angle so yes sea of thieves is a service game as such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide meaning climbing that structure to reach said features is non existent this unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has not happened it s still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content yes if you played sea of thieves on release and disliked the go from point a to point b back to a then repeat experience that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air while now being shorter than ever will probably still bore you as much as before however when that dead air is gone you will experience many many more interesting and funscenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations the point of this review isn t to just list all the positives and negatives after all you will find plenty of those already but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who s never played it sea of thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique and fun coop experiences i ve ever played it reminds me of a time when rare took a formula injected as much of their own personality and charm as they couldand also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title that stands on its own merit it just took as long as a steam release to make that happen
