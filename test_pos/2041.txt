2021 awesome game thrilling fast paced combat and movement systems beautiful art work and characters high skill cap variety of weapons and warrior abilities refreshing and novel new take on the br genre totally unique the variety of character abilities weapons and high skill cap means this game already has an abyssal depth with plenty of potential to add more i m puzzled though by the many negative reviews i ve seen here most negative reviews admit the game is very well thought out and kick ass but complain that they would like to see a region lock and a ping limit placed on lobbies as high ping is basically an exploit being used by eastern players to dominate na servers i m south african and as there are no regional servers here i play on eu servers with at best around 190 ping if there is a way to use this to my advantage please can someone explain it to me it has been extremely challenging trying to compete with the higher ping and since i ve hit bronze ii lobbies it s been almost impossible to win any 1 v 1 s unless i time everything perfectly with my high ping i experience the following unable to land standard parry the way i have been able to land a parry is by perfectly timing a jump or crouch parry or by faking a focus attack and switching to crouch parry even if i time this perfectly it is unreliable at best and attacks penetrate straight through my parry s focus attack doesn t reliably block standard attacks many light attacks penetrate my focus attack as if it doesn t exist 200 ms delay in such fast combat means i have to anticipate the opponent perfectly to land my combos i grapple away thinking i ve survived only to find i ve been struck and actually died i combo toward an opponent only to find he s moved and is now behind me ranged combat is almost impossible as at a distance as you cant accurately time or lead the shot in spite of these challenges i have managed to progress and enjoy the game and in light of my experience i don t understand how na players are saying high ping is being exploited to dominate their servers please explain it to me so i can have a better experience i would therefore not like it at all if the devs created a region lock or ping lock as i would not be able to play from south africa and this is what the devs mean when they say creating a region lock would cause them to lose players please can the dev s look into having regional servers in south africa there is a large gaming community and naraka would be popular many other big name titles if not most have servers in south africa this would greatly improve the gaming experience obviously you could try contacting gamesoft to arrange them hosting servers naraka is a solid thumbs up from me
