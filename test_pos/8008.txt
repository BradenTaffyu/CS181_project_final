2021 about to hit the 220 hour mark figured i would try and write a review noita wand spell torturenoita is a game about a lot of things discovery exploration getting set on fire dousing yourself in toxic sludge experimentation dying to a stealth propane tank getting set on fire dicing yourself with a giant sawblade uncovering the deepest secrets the world has to offer mastering the wandcrafting system to destroy your enemies and accidentally obliterate yourself and finally getting set on fire the world of noita is awash in flammable and explosive materials everything is therefore always on fire in noita and since the whole world is physically simulated this actually alters the environment in real time you will get set on fire a lot but so will your enemies and fire can be used to burn away wooden obstacles it s both a hazard and an opportunity just remember to have a flask of water at all times the game is also awash in magical materials that can be used to great effect on your journey buffing your damage teleporting you making you invisible or turning you into a sheep leaving you helpless as you re shotgunned in the face careful what you step in you will die a lot i have over 500 deaths and only 9 wins but in my over 200 hours playing this game i ve stopped caring about the win condition now the real focus of noita is the world itself the wand and spell system and how you interact with each when i started with this game i was satisfied with a basic chainsaw on trigger spell that let me shred the final boss and get a few wins my fastest run is about 40 minutes not bad still i have a terribly low win ratio but that s okay many of your runs will end quickly but noita is a long game 200 hours in i ve had six hour marathon sessions where i completely lost track of time wandering the world uncovering secrets and collecting wands spells and other treasures as an avid player of open world sandbox games like minecraft terraria and starbound exploring and digging around procedural worlds is like crack to me the first time i cracked open the holy mountain fought a miniboss completely off the main path and obtained the power to dig wherever i please completely changed my noita experience modern roguelike games are all about fast paced action and i m a big fan of those too but noita has done something unique my journey with this game is unlike anything else i ve played and it just gets more compelling the further i go but you will die and death is permanent that s okay though every new run is a fresh slate to build new and exciting spells and hopefully not blow yourself up with them as the steam description says use what you learn in the next run there are spells to unlock as you progress but not nearly as many as say dead cells your main form of progression in noita is just getting better at building wands and getting better at not dying in conclusion don t forget your water flask experiment make mistakes don t sweat it too much when you die you will lose good runs really good ones and it will sting but if this game hooks you like it has me you ll soon be itching to go back to the mountains for more what can i say it s magical
