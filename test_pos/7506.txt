2020 imagine a 9 hour worth of farming only to have it stolen by camping who got the drop on u spent around 5 minutes doing so so 9hrs worth of loot in 5 minutes is insane if you can recover from that then that game is definitely for you it s definitely a part of the experience as emphasized per title sea of thieves yep alotta thieving indeed it s basically a pirate s life filled with unfairness that shouldn t make u hate the game but love the risk u take each time u start a voyage graphics are astonishing so is the soundtrack mission stories constant update to the online experience with new maps and missions u just cant get enough each time u play the community on discord is friendly but trust me when i say ingame dont trust another every1 backstabs the other and it s just a freeforall griefer heaven
