2022 a dark fantasy for the ages elden ring is an absolute masterpiece having mastered the art of showing without telling it is vastly different from other open world games i have experienced such as the witcher 3 and skyrim which are story and questline driven from the get go elden ring does not impose any particular playstyle or route on you you are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game you can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses it truly is up to you with no outside influence this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game is refreshing not to mention elden ring has also mastered the art of subtlety for example for a game like skyrim there are various elements such as the character dialogues leveling system and various landmarks that i could clearly point to in contributing to the game s success however this is not the case here it is hard to place a finger on one specific thing that makes elden ring so enjoyable many times i have gone in to play this game for half an hour only to become immersed losing track of time and playing for hours on end i believe that the game s features i e the combat system transportation landscape lore storytelling etc complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing at the same time these elements come together in such a fluid manner that i as the player cannot notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that i have not felt from any game before environment this game has one of the most enormous and intricately detailed worlds i have ever seen in gaming i have not had a single moment where the map felt desolate or empty there was always something to see and explore the castles cities and fortresses that you must traverse in this game are truly awe inspiring they are all massive unique and filled with a plethora of secret areas just waiting to be uncovered the landscapes of the world are also astonishing the sheer variety and scale of the environments are a sight to behold players can expect to explore vast mountains forests fields deep caves ancient ruins and even hidden underground civilizations it is clear that a great amount of work went into the design of all of these areas as they are all exceptionally detailed and have complex lore realism and beauty to them that makes them a joy to explore combat the combat in this game is utterly masterful blending elements from many of fromsoftware s previous works including dark souls 3 bloodborne and sekiro to create an extremely tense fluid and customizable combat system the amount of variety in terms of different playstyles build variation and weapon types are enough to make the combat in this game endlessly enjoyable you also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous souls game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch walking which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit there s now horseback combat in large open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right handed weapon but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages and most substantially you can equip ashes of war to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill the ashes of war system essentially combines two elements of prior souls games weapon affinities and weapon skills by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments for example let s say you find a really good rapier and like the moveset but are building your character with a focus on the intelligence stat which means it won t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon if you find an art of war that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon you can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon thereby giving it intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the ash of war has best of all if you eventually decide to re spec into a different build you can still keep the same weapon and just put a different ash of war onto it of course you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities but it s nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons bosses the boss roster of elden ring is also extremely difficult and unforgettable most of the boss battles are remarkably challenging rich with lore and breathtaking the complex fighting style of the bosses cannot be overlooked many of the bosses have extremely intricate fast and punishing attacks that are both tough to avoid and fun to fight against this makes the battles against the bosses feel like a dance as you rhythmically dodge their devastating combo attacks before finding small windows to go on the offensive this is nothing new as this style of boss encounter is exactly what the dark souls series pioneered however elden ring perfects this age old formula by giving the bosses bigger movesets greater speed and more complex combos than ever before some of the bosses can hammer you with 10 hit long combos with little margin for error and the player must master a boss moveset if they ever hope to come out on top when you combine this with the grotesquely stunning visual design you get some of the tensest and most engaging boss battles in history on top of all this the epic scope of the boss encounters and vast areas is further heightened by elden ring s stellar musical score it perfectly conveys the emotional connection that you should have with whichever boss you are fighting many of the soundtracks in this game are utterly blood pumping in a way that few other video games can match conclusion overall in my opinion elden ring more than lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it proving to be one of the most memorable challenging and complex gaming experiences of the last century score 9 8 10was this review helpful
