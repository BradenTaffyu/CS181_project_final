just for perspective i have over 1000 hours in the dark souls trilogy and i am a huge fromsoft fan i usually avoid most souls likes because they can feel like cheap copies but this game was special i thoroughly enjoyed my three playthroughs of it and for me it had captured that magic feeling that so far only fromsoft could special shout out to the boss fights attacks are telegraphed well no delayed attacks and fights can be learnt and executed to perfection with enough tries the ost is quite enjoyable too which just adds to the souls experience since usually only fromsoft has nailed good music so far highly recommended to souls fans especially if you like the games for their fair challenge and the satisfaction that comes from overcoming them eagerly looking forward to more from this dev
