2014 counter strike global offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend it s a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the source engine to new players csgo may feel a little back to the basics as this game does not have aiming down the sight unlocks attachments perks and killstreaks so it s heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks this game does have a ranking system but it s different from all the other shooters which i ll explain later on but the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked it s also a tactical teamplay based shooter so don t even think about buying it if you don t like teamplay only a good team can lead you to victory not a highly skilled lone wolf csgo offers a small variety of game modes those are deathmatch arms race demolition classic casual and classic competitive for those of you who are familiar with cod arms race is called gun game in cod you start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you ll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game what s rather interesting about arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins demolition is a combination between classic i ll explain classic later in the review and arms race the goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you ll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs in my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because i never really feel the need to play them there s also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual team deathmatch it s played 5v5 and all weapons are available except for grenades you play in a team but it s every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins what s also interesting about deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points in my opinion deathmatch shouldn t be taken to serious it s a good gamemode to improve your aim and i know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that s in my opinion not the way counter strike is supposed to be played so that leaves classic casual and classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes therefore i ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes classic consists of the two original counter strike game modes defuse mission and hostage mission in hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists in defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it s planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system you ll receive money for all sorts of things playing a round of course the winning team receives more in most cases completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills the kill reward depends on the weapon a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an smg except for p90 gives you 2 kill reward a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the awp gives only 0 5 kill reward at the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don t spend will carry over to the next round so now the differences between casual and competitive in casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins in casual you ll receive more money if you lose a round less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300 the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual competitive is played 5v5 and casual can be played 10v10 in competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual in casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you re not supposed to leave until the game is finished because if you do you ll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and i ve seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown this is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you ll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair if you play casual you ll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win lose ratio and you ll play with people of the same skill level as you there s also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules use community maps or even have completely different game modes i don t spend a lot of time on community servers so i can t tell you more than this in my opinion competitive is the way to play csgo i spend by far most of my time playing competitive casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive if you re new though i advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge why should you do this in casual well competitive is way more serious there s also an option to play against bots if you re new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players the only negative points i can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn t always works as it is supposed to work and the ranking system has to be improved at the time of writing i am silver elite master fifth rank but some silver elites fourth rank are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players seventh rank are much worse and they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in cs s are way harder than expert bots in csgo making bot practice less useful over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter i even watch csgo e sport it s a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks i give csgo a 10 10 this doesn t mean the game is perfect of course it can be improved but it s based on the fun factor and even though i sometimes hate this game out of pure frustration i ll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it
