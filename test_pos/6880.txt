2018 the call of duty that made me happy the call of duty that got me through depression the call of duty that did everything the zombies and multiplayer were so unbelievably fantastic that the campaign being complete ass didn t even matter or effect peoples opinion on this game because everyone was so hypnotized by the perfection of black ops 3 s zombies and multiplayer please i beg of you if you haven t played black ops 3 zombies do yourself a big favor and play it experience it and you will discover why i say the zombies is pure perfection i hate to say it i really do but i think its almost if not impossible to ever ever recreate what they did with black ops 3 zombies and even multiplayer it would take alot of heart and soul to re create what black ops 3 did to the world but never say never right gamers black ops 3 forever gamers black ops 3 forever
