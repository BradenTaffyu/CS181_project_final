2017 i found this game super fun even tho i panic a lot when playing it xd this game has a grate amount of maps and different killers survivors that you can play as i really like the blood web tree were you can unlock perks and items to use that can aid you with escaping at times it can get super intense with the killer close by or worse if their chasing you i would give this game a 7 10 and if you like thriller horror games this is without doubt one to add to your library
