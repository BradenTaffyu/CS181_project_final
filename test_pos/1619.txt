2023 i don t think i ll ever be able to play another total war game because i don t think ca will ever be able to top what they created with warhammer iii and with every patch it becomes better and better i ve collected all dlcs since warhammer 1 and intend to complete my collection as they are released one of my gripes with the game is the dlc pricing the latest one was especially expensive
