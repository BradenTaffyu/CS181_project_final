2022 having a dark souls game as an actual open world was always a dream for me i can only complain of the game performance being the only issue that i struggle to play with especially if i want to try and play online with a friend or help people i have spent already around 60 hour simply just lost the track of the main story or the main path of the game events just roaming around exploring every ruins caves and buildings simply to get weapons armors skills and what so ever i finally decided to go on the main path and i been highly addicted to just wake up and have some exploring around the game world i quite recommend everyone to give elden ring a try the difficulty can spike a little at some areas i can say more than previous dark souls series but it s doable the game is quite friendly to new souls players who hasn t played previous titles as well in short this is defo game of the year updated you can simply play and be anything you wish to be in here with more options to rebuild your character i will give even a more detailed review about the game as a whole when i finally decide to finish it which i doubt it will be anytime soon
