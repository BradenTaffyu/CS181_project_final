a magical staff a best bud and a dream the game is a visual feast filled with breathtaking combat and mesmerising music sometimes the cutscenes can be straight from movies the game opens up slowly revealing our objectives and backstory about main characters through really well done animated shorts though more detailed information and complete lore can be found in the journal page that updates as you progress similar to item description in souls game the boss fights in this game is so well done that you never get bored even if the game throws boss at your face frequently and the boss designs movesets the details their interaction reaction to the player is one of the highlighting part of the game before playing it i came across the news that there s a lot of boss in the game and i was worried what if it starts becoming stale fighting this many bosses but boy was i wrong personal favorites from the gameopening fightheadless guy with his bangersbest boi bajiethe stare down at enemies and walking slowly in the fight area which feels absolutely badassthe secret areas in every chaptera very rewarding explorationnimbus cloudend boss fightsecret ending boss fight it s absolute cinema the optimisation is really well done for an ue5 game though the final chapter had lot of stutters for me and also that chapter lacked things in comparison to previous chapters and it s the only chapter that didnot stick with me except the boss fight who i still hate for being an absolute that being said this is the goty for me though there are some really good games on the horizon
