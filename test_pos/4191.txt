2018 first good things about warframe this game has spoiled me i will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer be it aaa or indie this game is free get it free you are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game all characters quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time that being said i have spent money on this why cosmetics of course fashion is endgame you know now just what is warframe warframe is a mostly pve third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay you have seen games do parkour before of course but these are space ninjas we re talking about which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets rockets and or high energy plasma or just take out your trusty sword hammer fists and cripple anything in your path what will you face humanoids robots aliens you name it yes there are bosses and they can and will kick your butt what will you face them with hundreds and i mean hundreds of weapons to choose from each of them unique in its own way and deeply customizable to suit your needs and or taste you can carry three of them at a time a primary weapon bow rifle etc a secondary weapon pistol throwing knives and other things and of course a melee weapon now you can always tear through the game solo but for the best experience the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of earth to an all out extermination in the frozen wastelands of pluto but doing missions is just one part of it you also have a widely explorable open world area with its own assortment of missions waiting for you and this open world thing is only going get bigger in future updates oh and the updates they are a regular thing like every other day now what s the story can t tell you its a secret no really the game community is super protective of the game lore there is a certain point in the game where you will know and then we can talk about it but until then you gotta find out for yourself for now just consider yourself a space ninja how about difficulty scales up with your level just like most modern mmos the game will be just as hard as you want to handle if you want to go at it casually there s content for you if you re looking for a challenge good news the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely now bad things about warframe pvp sucks grinding lots of grinding there are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and or have been in development hell for ages your inventory slots are limited and you can buy more by using the premium currency while technically you do not need to buy more slots since you can simply sell what you don t need or want it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum if you ever do about grinding this is both a good and bad thing about the game most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it s a little diferent in warframe the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game grinding is what you do to pass the time it is so integrated into the game world that you don t really notice it so yeah there is a lot of grinding but you have fun while doing it final thoughts now i m not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything more like game of the decade but the level of attention and communication that digital extremes the game devs has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous these people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry and i can only see good things in the future for them in conclusion we don t deserve warframe also you can have a space dog cat and pet them 10 10 edit grammar
