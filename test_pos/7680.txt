2023 sea of thieves is a very entertaining game but has some downsides that can make it rather unappealing to some people i will break it down in a pros cons list pros great with friends total of 4 crew members on the largest ship including yourself plenty to do quests treasure maps for that looty booty fishing pve plundering pve is actually rather entertaining and rewarding large map plenty of islands outposts secrets to find and explore safer seas so you could go into a private session to do tall tales or get to know the game mechanics guilds allows 24 players to join work together to gain additional rewards also allows ship sharing a few different ships for different crew sizes variety of tools weapons ammo types to utilise customisation options for both the ship player pets dogs cats foxes parrots monkeys plus if you can afford to spare the ancient coins outfits for the pets sea shanties need i say more cons pvp in all areas i ve been attacked at sea spawn camped on my own boat ambushed at an outpost where i was trying to sell my haul of loot tricked with the alliance system there is no passive zones or passive mode upon spawn with a x amount of time before you start taking damage again which is rather annoying sea of thieves has a rather crappy community some people will avoid you or be nice to you but most will try to kill you just for sport the slim chance of loot i ve spent 30mins in a session just fishing chilling winding down after a busy day people have literally killed me for fish fish for crying out loud which can barely get you 1k gold useless reporting system can t report racism griefing or any type of harassment without a video of it happening most reports without that get ignored less enjoyable by your lonesome it s not terrible it s just better with friends safer seas private sessions have a slight waiting time to them aren t as rewarding as normal sessions gold gains are reduced significantly no emissaries level gains are capped guilds are a thing but being able to set sail with multiple crewed ships on the same server from one guild from my knowledge hasn t been implemented if you have more than 3 friends that you want to play sea of thieves with in the same server be prepared to do 20mins of server hopping requires a xbox microsoft account conclusion generally i do believe this game is pretty awesome as for 6 months i continuously sank time into it but while communities can often make games in the case of sea of thieves it can also break them i ve played solo with friends i ve joined random people via the official discord met some really cool people on the high seas however these cool people are far few between rare makes it more rewarding for people to be douches towards each other that for me is quite annoying because i often play to chill out not compete with others for loot that i ve already worked hard for so all in all if you re reading this review i d say this game is worth buying but only if you ve got friends to play with whilst it s on a 33 discount or more
