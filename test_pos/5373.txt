2020 for my money the best multiplayer fps experience you can have on pc rivaled only by bf3 this extremely engaging tactical shooter doesn t need much introduction you probably already own it or have played it before it s lol dota style operators encouraging players of any type to experiment and find your own playstyle it s ludicrous how much variety there is when you dig into the maps loadouts customization and finally the meta at the time of writing this the new operation void edge is about to drop and i m immensely excited there is a grand total of 54 ops available right now and the amount of combos and synergy is quite astounding all in all an wonderfully complete fps with loveable and hateable looking at you clash and blackbeard characters a very visceral and rewarding combat experience and a constant stream of new content not perfect but about as good as it gets for an online fps i can t recommend this game highly enough now go and buy it and i hope to see you in the game sometime 9 10
