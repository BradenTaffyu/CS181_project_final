2023 a fantastic roguelike platformer where you ll scream at your monitor and swear never to play it again only to well play it again admittedly you need to put in some time to really begin understanding the magic behind it in a nutshell you re a little wizard dude armed some two basic low level wands some unenhanced spells a potion and that s it it s your job to make your way down from area to area while gathering gold swapping out old wands for better wands and learning the alchemy system for mixing potions or just using them as they you find them the controls are solid there is a large variety of enemies and each area is radically different to the last the special while the game encourages you to keep going down and using the portal to move onto the next area once you ve satisfied you ve gotten everything you can from your currently area there are many secrets to uncover once you decide to go off the beaten path this is also tempered with the need for survival get too low on health and you ll be faced with a risk vs reward decision as your health is replenished upon arriving in a new area the game changer wands and spells each wand comes with stats such as accuracy mana amount for casting more expensive spells recharge rate and fire rate wands also come with multiple slots which between levels you can remove the spells and effects that came with the wand for other spells and effects you ve either picked up or bought finally wands either fire spells randomly or in the order you placed them spell effects have radically different results depending on the spell type you re altering and as the game progresses the space wands come with for placing stuff in them grows allowing for completely bat sh t insane combinations you ll find that most if not all your deaths come from the player doing something catastrophically stupid such as attaching rotating fireball effect to giant buzz saw boomerang spells and then firing off that one in a tight enclosed area or drinking acid potion by mistake or trying to fire off an electrically charged spell while submerged in water or etc you get the picture it s great though that death works this way as you can almost never blame the game for deaths and this is i think the main reason we who love this game keep coming back because we understand that while it is insane it is fair and it s up to us to use our heads that being said sometimes we just want to go nuts and create a killeverything spell and when it backfires it s usually just as glorious as winning pretty sure my hours speak for themselves as does the overwhelming positive rating this game has on steam well earned and justified
