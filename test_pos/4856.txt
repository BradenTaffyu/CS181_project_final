2022 finally the call of duty has come back to steam this has been like 5 years in the making or something like that i think i still remember fondly my days of playing call of duty with my buddy watching him destroy everything while i ran around with my shotgun and hid in corners to pop out and one shot kill people as they ran by putting up my 2 and 25 impressive kd ratio into a game of domination but pretending i helped the team because i had 6 captures and was ranked 2nd on the leaderboard in a game my team lost 120 200 where my 25 deaths likely helped the winning side get a bunch of kill streaks anyway that part aside call of duty is back and of course i purchased it the first day it was available to buy the most expensive version of the game because if i m not good at the game at the very least i can spend money like i am and make sure i have the best version of the game available while this years edition of the game lacks zombies my second favorite mode to suck at the multiplayer is still sweet and i almost never had this much fun while losing almost every game it was almost as much fun as playing dead by daylight a few years back when the killers were grossly underpowered the game has a campaign mode see that ea take notice of the fact people still love single player experiences i ve yet to touch the single player game although just knowing it s there fills me with a sense of pride that maybe one day i ll fire up the single player content and finish it although probably not just like all the other call of duties i ll play about 50 80 hours of multiplayer then get angry when the first dlc pack drops and the hackers discover all their nasty anti cheat avoiding hacks that make mulitplayer unfun i figure we have another 3 months or so of fun mostly hacker free gaming until that point happens multiplayer will be the lionshare of what most people will play it s fun balanced and crossplatform it s almost as much fun as watching a box of rabid kittens chew each other while the momma kitten slinks off into an alleyway looking for catnip just remember it s not how well you can play the game but how awesome it is telling a squaky throat ed seven year old to retrieve your sneakers from under his mothers bed don t do that you ll get banned for bad talking seven year olds just remember my friends with call of duty you are probably going to die alot and if you scream that is impossible and accuse the person of being a hacker you ll fit right in
