2021 warframe is a space ninja sim set on exploring the player s oedipus complex where your step moms are constantly stuck and constantly need help gameplay wise it s a grind heavy action mmo with an excellent mobility system great core gameplay cool gun design and a sense of wonder which will all in time turn into bitterness boredom disappointment and erotic fanfiction the game exists in a constant semi broken state but you get used to it after a while the gameplay is built around an action loop you load in do your chosen objective running on walls like a hyperactive teenager then finish the mission and collect the loot the formula has variations the action might take place in an open world section or in space with co op ship piloting and boarding and sometimes the variations are good and sometimes they are not the power progression is gated between build timers exp milestones random drop chances out of season april fool s jokes and most of all behind the game never lowering itself to properly explain anything nevertheless the core of being a ridiculously mobile and deadly ninja is almost always there and it carries the experience is the game fun yes is it not fun yes as it stands it leaves you with a choice make the gameplay optional or make the winning optional if you choose the former the only comment you will leave under this review in a few months will be e e e e e ee eee e ee since your mind will long have gone replaced by a big button you instinctively try to press to solve any in game or irl problem and if you choose to reject the one button you ll be constantly feeling underpowered slowing your team down and disappointing your space mom especially with the high level content it s up to you to pick your poison and play the balancing act the devs won t save you from this choice you can believe in them but it s like believing in santa the development cycle looks as follows first the devs will tell you they re gonna go buy groceries real quick then they ll disappear for half a year then show up drunk and with a paraplegic goat in tow after a year or so of vet visits the developers might silently admit that the goat while eventually nice might not have been a bag of groceries and they ll proceed to announce groceries 2 0 whether you re going to end up with a cucumber themed dildo or a korean ladyboy nicknamed gross eris is anybody s guess however you can play with gross eris for free of course there s a catch if you don t know where to get things what things to get how to sell them and how to not go insane while doing it comfortably playing for free isn t an option oh it will be after 100 200 hours of game knowledge settle in but not now attempting it from the start really isn t worth it so here s an actual advice if you like the game initially wait for the 75 platinum discount you could get on logging in spend the standard mmo subscription amount on plat get yourself an affinity booster a resource booster some weapons slots warframe slots a couple of reactors and a palette or two if you still like the game and are playing a month after repeat the process everything past that paying ll be optional and as bonus your family will actually get to see you between the game sessions listening to you mumbling e e eeeee eeeee when asked to pass the salt personally i have no regrets over the time i spent being a ninja warframe begs to be a game about skill and while it is made a game about numbers there s just enough freedom and cleavage to make you enjoy the ride nonetheless and then there s daughter i ain t saying i d simp for her mind you but you would don t lie
