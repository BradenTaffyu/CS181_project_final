i used to play this game on xbox and accumulated a lot of hours on it so with that my review is coming from experience of this game i want to start this off by saying i m neutral about this game but slightly leaning towards the positive side because when the game is good it s wonderful you can make memories have laughs meet lovely people and just overall enjoy your experience playing dbd but when the game is bad it s truly a terrible experience once that bad starts to show it just ruins your entire play session whether it s playing as a killer and going against self entitled survivors that want you to play the game a certain way and if you don t you receive really disgusting and unsettling messages over literal pixels as a survivor it s the same style of concept just partially different you can receive cruel messages for simply playing the game how you re supposed to toxicity from your fellow survivors for not doing a certain thing for them example taking a hit for them when you re death hook when they haven t been hooked once or not sacrificing yourself on hook so they can get hatch when they hid all game for zero reason lmao i genuinely adore this game with its funny moments like getting jump scared by nemesis zombies killer using tinkerer going against bubbas i love bubba players they are so silly and cute hehe meeting wholesome survivors killers playing perk roulette with my friends slug races ily with all my heart if you participate host them and overall just playing the game for fun and not taking it so seriously thank you so much for taking the time to read everything and stay safe in the fog
