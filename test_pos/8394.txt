2023 i am absolutely floored i was buying this game to get a discount fromsoft game but what i found instead was truly special in ways i did not expect lies of p wears its inspirations on its sleeve so it is easy to assume that many people who think about buying the game and reading this review as a result want to play something like bloodborne and are contemplating if they should buy this one this review is for people like that i have 100 ed every fromsoft game including bloodborne so the described experience might be completely different for a new player to the genre let s cut to the chase i think lies of p is a much better game than bloodborne before you leave a clown award on this review please give me a moment to explain combat before we start it is important to note that i absolutely love bloodborne but in my opinion people really tend to overhype it for what it is the main game bloodborne has 2 or 3 good bosses with literally every other boss being strafe right hit r1 bosses like paarl died without me even understanding what just happened lies of p avoids this issue completely and nearly every single boss with a single exception looking at you chapter 10 gang feels amazing to fight it scratches the same itch as good sekiro bosses do you get into this flow state where you can parry attack after attack and it just feels incredible bosses in lies of p rarely die on a first attempt game really demands you to learn the attack pattern of each boss and perform well throughout the whole fight difficulty if you are a newer player i think bloodborne will be a much better starting point lies of p is rough i would even go as far as to say that this is the hardest souls like game i ve ever played but as usual you have your options summoning npcs to draw boss aggro away using absolutely busted throwables or a shield hand will make the experience a ton easier if you are looking to tone down difficulty a notch exploration while the level design in bloodborne might be less linear it kinda feels homogenized to me the entirety of yahrnam just feels the same i can t name any non dlc area that isn t a city or a forest at the same time each area in lies of p feels distinct to me it might be more linear but level design is equally as great a bunch of nooks and crannies to explore secrets to find and shortcuts to open progression one of the biggest issues i have with bloodborne that this game avoids is the lack of gameplay variety sure trick weapons are cool and all but not being able to change your build to try out new weapons funnels you into using just a couple of weapons during your entire playthrough you don t get enough upgrade materials to upgrade some random weapon on a whim and play with it for a while both of these issues combined resulted in me playing the entirety of bloodborne start to finish with a cane whip thing because it felt like the most effective weapon at nearly all times sure i might ve found something better along the way but i couldn t risk spending precious upgrade materials to check out the weapon at its full potential lies of p is extremely generous with weapon upgrade materials but strikes a perfect balance where you wouldn t be able to upgrade everything under the sun immediately either qol while might not seem important it s the little things that add up during the playtime that decide your overall enjoyment of the game for example the fast travel system in bloodborne is horrible zones are split into different fast travel objects with no images attached to names of locations and sometimes it s infuriating to try and remember which place was which i don t even have to mention the fact that healing items not replenishing on rest lies of p on top of improving everything i just mentioned also goes the extra mile by having a bunch of qol stuff like training dummies in the hub to check your weapon damage and movesets tells you when a certain npc wants to talk to you and reminds you where you picked up that quest you just completed so you don t have to teleport around the entire game trying to remember who wanted this bottle of wine you just found story both games have great stories but i liked the story for lies of p more this point is completely subjective though more so than everything else characters in lies of p were interesting enough for me to come back to hotel krat to listen to what they had to say each time a new dialogue became available there s just something so magical about the hotel the music the ambiance i just can t get enough of it conclusion at this point it might sound like i just hate bloodborne but no not at all i think it was a brilliant game but isn t a gift from gaming gods that many people make it out to be is lies of p without faults of course no some of the boss attacks aren t clearly telegraphed the difficulty balancing can use more work the endgame is rough with chapter 10 s gank boss absolutely sucking and climbing the tower in the end being rather tedious however these issues don t stop the game from being absolutely fantastic in my opinion overall i don t think most people would ever agree that this game is better than bloodborne simply because of how iconic bloodborne has become over the years but for me lies of p is so much more such a beautiful game really didn t expect it to be this great when i was buying it
