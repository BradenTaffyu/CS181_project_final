2015 see end for summary i really love this game but i am very objective when i make my reviews there are both good and bad things here we go pros combat there is a good variety of weapons you can mod them with a few mods and each one of them has different advantages devs i like the way the game is going at this moment what i really care about is that the maps will be free i heard the operators will be available to buy with renown as well i bought the season pass anyway because i encourage that type of initiative from the devs i ve never been a fan of microtransactions but at least they did it only for aeshetic stuff so i m okay with that game modes you can play pve and pvp both have different modes while in pvp it doesn t make much of a difference because people end up killing each other anyway in pve it does operators they sound stupid at first but it s cool to have different operators that do different things just make sure you tell fuze not to use the cluster charge during an extract hostage replayability sure there is not a crazy number of maps but there are different modes and enemies and objectives spawn at different locations making each time you play it different servers i agree they were not perfect but i have seen games releasing much worse they also got better over time cons ai or au artificial unintelligence at times the ai is either incredibly smart headshots you through walls or incredibly stupid walks right into the line of fire could use some fixing also normal should be easier for casuals balancing there is some balancing to do it s not terrible but some operators don t have really good weapons shotguns need to be buffed just a little bit briefing screen the game mode should stay in the briefing screen where you select the operator and vote because i choose operators according to the game mode and often times i miss that 1 second screen disadvantages of having ssds kicking rules add a required field that asks why somebody is getting voted to kick apparently i got kicked for being too good 41 kills at least i could take a screenshot and show it to my friends for a good laugh mic seems like half or more of the players that talk in game do not realize they are lol make sure you put push to talk and treshold to 0 not sure why push to talk by itself does not work no host migration come on i don t like getting kicked to the main menu because the host died at the end and ragequits no offline cannot play without an internet connection you have to be connected to their servers even if you are playing solo unless you are doing the situations but no reward servers matchmaking while it is in the pros it is also in the cons because they can definitely be worked on i know there is something i am forgetting i will add it as it comes to my mind summarythe game is good i won t say worth it or not since 60 is worth one thing to me and another to you but you can find it for cheaper if you search well personally speaking yes it is absolutely worth it you can play pve or pvp whatever you like good graphics good gameplay lots of fun definitely a game to pick up especially if you like fps and coops games just be aware that it is slower than most shooters i wouldn t say it s tactical but it s not a run and shoot you should give it a shot if you can play it with friends it s even better even though i seem to play worse with them because i get distracted lel let me know what you think
