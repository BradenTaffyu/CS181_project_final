2022 don t get me wrong i love this game i encourage more na people to buy and play it combat is really smooth and fluid movement too has some real potential what i don t like is the fact that i get a game after waiting 10 minutes then spend 30s actually playing the game because a laggy high rank chinese player ran at me and stunlocks me to death
