2020 dead by daylight witness the completely truly absolutely personalities of the players of this game and murder them a game where you do good you get called a tryhard a game where you do bad you get called absolute trash ok i was lying a bit no way that you d get called something that tame ever as a killer prepare to be called slurs and getting death threats just because you took advantage of a play they did as a survivor watch the killer take unnecessarily long to murder you to act smug when they catch you off of a mistake and then proceed to insult you in the after game lobby the small saving grace is that sometimes people are nice and when they are they re really nice the game itself is fantastic though and i enjoy it i also get some sick enjoyment from listening to people raging but truly truly if you can t brush off massive amounts of toxicity it probably isn t the game for you the only reason i can play this and not care about toxicity is that i have played league of legends since 2013 edit wrote this review when i had around 50 hours 200 hours now i can say nothing s changed double edit over 500 hours still no change
