2015 pros campaign is awesome it is dark atmospheric and keeping you interested the whole time visuals are good well engine is old but the game is still looking ok customization everywhere from multiplayer to even single player large and non linear sp levels shadows of evil and giant maps are looking and playing great multiplayer is good it s same but this is what makes it goodcons only 1 zombie map without deluxe edition campaign is not built for coop mode optimization was very poor seems fixed for me now but still it is a shame what after 3 years 3arc cant simply optimize the game on this old engine some balance problems in mpsince i am a cod fanboy this game worth 60 for me but i feel kinda dissapointed i thought what after 3 years of development 3arc will made a game that would be a worthy succesor of black ops 2 but actually this is a step backwards after 3arc previous game but still it is a lot fun i recommend it
