i enjoyed the first game immensely this one s just like it but with improved well just about everything the story is short but that doesn t matter the combat system is where it s at i ve played through about 4 times since the day it came out and will sometimes just restart anew to enjoy the challenge of the combat once you get to a certain level or beat the game the enemy difficulty does not rise it s not a perfect game but what it does right it does right better than any other game i ve ever seen in this genre so it owns me and flaws and all it was worth every penny and then some
