product received for free having played roughly 45 hours across the steam beta test in 2022 crossplay open beta test in 2023 and the final technical test earlier in may of 2024 the game had me hooked constantly throughout all 3 periods now that the game is out fully i ve actually been able to sink more time into it granted my current playtime at the time of this review is lower than my time in the earlier builds but i wanted to get some thoughts out of the way and also address some of the issues other people have had having played both warframe and destiny for extensively long periods of time both on console and pc i can say for certain that tfd is a mix of both games but its an actual very good blend while still leaning moreso towards warframe combat is snappy and the guns are punchy which is a quality both games shared but tfd seems to follow a more conventional gun design like destiny unlike some of the wild and absurd but still very neat stuff found within warframe the character roster is definitely not as diverse as warframe but its certainly not as limited as destinys 3 classes the grapple hook feels like a way to not completely copy warframes amazing movement system but the very limited range leaves me forgetting to use it as a tool during combat and moreso a tool to get to an objective if this is the goal nexon had in mind then thats fine i am aware that it can stun enemies and lead into sub attacks but i feel like it could be fleshed out more i have not finished the story as of making this review but i will say it does have a fair share of cringey dialogue moments and just generally unlikeable characters jeremy someone you meet as you enter the sterile land is an absolute entited head and i am hoping to take care of him later on in the story but there are also neat parts of the game where descendants themself have a questline to follow as of the launch of the game bunny the unofficial poster child of the game has a questline where she has to figure out what happened to her family all the while experiencing flashbacks as well its actually really neat and makes me wish warframe did something similar for more of their warframes now onto the elephant in the room microtransactions with this being my first nexon game i was unaware of the greediness and apparent neglect nexon had to community feedback strangely enough they seemed to have been very open with the community for tfd during the final tech test back in may they had this system where you could randomly roll for colors and after the test had concluded the community expressed their dissatisfaction about this system and preferred the system from the crossplay beta test while i agree with the sentiment i don t entirely hate where nexon went with the color system in the full game i think you should be able to buy the color as a one and done thing similar to how warframe does color palettes personally i think you shouldn t have to buy colors to begin with but if thats a no go then i think a one time purchase will be fine just don t pull what halo infinite did please as for bundles for ultimate characters and the complaints about those warframe has done this exact same thing with the prime access system granted you d end up getting more bang for your buck as the prime warframe also came with multiple prime weapons but at its core its the same thing as the ultimate character bundles in the tfd i do think that the cosmetic stuff found in the 100 usd bundle should also be sold as its own separate thing in the event the player gets the ultimate descendant via playing the game though overall the first descendant feels different enough that i believe it can coexist with warframe and destiny and with the remainder of the year already seemingly jam packed with content for the game i am hopeful that the game ends up prospering one last thing i would like to remind either active players or people looking to try the game if you don t like the monetization method you don t need to drop the entire game express your feedback politely and through the appropriate channels reviews reddit discord etc and only then could change actually happen harassment of devs does not win in any scenario
