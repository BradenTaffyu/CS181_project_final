2019 early access review an absolute blast to play picked this game up after seeing a 30 second clip on twitch and haven t regret it for a single moment while playing the game gameplay is what you get if terraria and magica hooked up at a bar and had a roguelike baby that grew up to do crack while some people say it s somewhat shallow and too difficult i think it s just the right mix to where you can experiment but still play an incredibly fragile character the only thing that is stopping this game from being great is a lack of character progression i wish you could start with different spells or even something as simple as starting with a different outfit outside that and some very minor balance issues i have no gripes with this game and easily recommend it to everyone this game has a ton of potential and i m keen on seeing where it goes also i forgot to mention that the soundtrack to this game is absolutely great
