2020 warframe is an amazing free game best i ve seen yet mind you i ve only been around for 10 years when i first started playing community are so friendly you join a clan and there s a high chance they ll donate you to give you a boost characters or frames have really unique design not only that there s tones of gameplays like stealth dps support tank and speedrun but you don t have to stick with one gameplay because of something called modding you can add mods and make up your own gameplay enough said about that you can also go fishing and mining or just exploring yep it s also open world not only that the story mode is so dramatic and it really captures your thoughts you can also ride hover boards and fly on jetpack wings or archwings and you can drive space ships get the game it ll worth your time also might be a bit slow at the start
