1 my review is based on my experience playing the game with frame generation mod installed if i wasn t using it this game would be at max a 3 10 due to performance issues even when i m using a 13900k 4090 setup the review amazing game very addictive for reasons i can t yet explain i ve played better games that didn t get a hold on me like this one is it the story heck no but the world building and gameplay are very good i dislike the fact that npcs in the city and everywhere really don t react to stuff you do like stealing from inside people s houses etc to trigger a reaction the only thing that does it is draw your weapon and they flee ng feels a bit off due to no enemy scaling the mtx complaints are valid but to be fair i had more than i could spend in items without ever even consider buying any mtx 8 10
