2015 i normally don t write reviews for games but being an army infantry vet and an avid csgo player with 3k hours i can safely say this game is amazing it s such a new breath of fresh air within fpss it s got the graphics the gameplay is amazing learning to play from every agnle possible is part of the fun here hanging upside down in a window and shooting people is amazingly fun finding people in mm to breach and clear rooms it brought me back to my army days never have i felt such fun in a new game until now the guns have their limits but aren t exactly the focus there s not really a huge balance issue with this game either most of the time when you die you just get out played every gun has their play style like shotguns you actually have to play close to walls or windows and not try to shoot medium to far range like to be able to take out enemies who like to peak from afar pick up a riflelike to run and gun well too bad go back to cod those who complain about the game are normally the cod players or silvers out of csgo who can t actually aim and need to find something to complain about this is by far one of my new favorite games
