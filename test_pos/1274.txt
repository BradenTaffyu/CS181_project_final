again and again i entered the violent lands of gold facing crashes and frame drops twice i respawned in a world with not a single soul in it only strange moons over the empty wastes power washed by storms and god rays then i perished in a sapling why couldn t i hold a grudge for starters the black knife goth gf of gaming possesses a pornographic level of mass appeal 80s fantasy ost exquisite architecture and every detail has a clear purpose the prettiness of flower fields the sick armour sets the towering spires the suffocating catacombs nothing is over designed vistas are money shots but a random room can resemble a painting and the game looks awesome in action all these flashy animations and effects dramatic lighting how the water splashes when a leviathan octopus leaps into the air waving its tentacles abyssal woods gargantuan hands tremendous poop in my pants diminishing returnsevery playstyle is valid but i have preferences i went with polearms and faith buffs for versatility no summons or mimics these tend to break bosses and broken souls are a sad sight after all what is the adhesive binding so many people to these cruel worlds suffering seeking something that would ease it is part of it souls forfeit easy mode and blaming it on the community s elitism is reductionist your advantage is built in i m a scrub and i found mine if given the tools to express yourself through boundless gearing and stat options you refuse to figure out how to mitigate the pain hurt on alas the balance is delicate when you overlevel you may miss good fights radahn was a pushover by the time i checked on him half of leyndell was f cked i got carried away seduced by exploration to be punished for it mercifully things evened out as i restrained myself to play on curve before losing more game loreto parse a souls game s narrative is typically its biggest challenge i always fell for the poetry of fragmented storytelling so consonant with the shattered realities having said that here the meaning isn t as codified your avatar a lowly tarnished their kindred exiled by the god queen in the past returns to the lands between to fulfil a bitter prophecy undergoing a vibrant kind of decay much the land got encrusted in the blooming buboes of rot in your absence the beauty one s eyes find in such a disaster evokes a semblance of guilt leave it to the righteous dogs on your hit list akin to a gloating viking you charge at the brood of demigod royalty take their heads and melt down their golden idols and the ring what of it maidens i d do it for a donut while the plot is relatively clear the quest design is obtuse reflecting on the uncaring world i guess you ll be gently guided by detached characters who either dismiss your ass or die for it they reappear at random reluctantly sending you on obscure missions just to get rid of you for a while or so it seems this isolating alienation is so compelling who knew we longed for a dehumanising angle left for dead with our incomplete self at last we become unstoppable vessels of senseless dedication is this a vengeful voyage of hope or the freedom of losing it maybe it isn t alienating at all instilling a sense of being sheltered instead imprisoned placed in a pocket realm of someone else s misery to soak it in like a napkin for this intimacy i play offline sike my internet is trash the lands betweeni played for the sense of discovery coming with trespassing in liminal spaces taking in the esoteric structure that s close to shadow of the colossus with its hurtful grandiosity don t get too sentimental complacency gets abused by unfair monster placement traps pits everything getting to know this world is like walking in heavy rain despite the efforts not to wet your socks soon there ll be nothing left to lose the rain pours on everyone but you re so drenched you become its integral part revel in that sad freedom the world was designed for agency not to waste your time it knows how to fuel your greed for progress and adds that gambler s ardour to the process of not so aimless wondering there s always a shortcut to unlock an upgrade something to meaningfully interact with or delve into lush castles of intricate designs underground cities wuthering heights ruins brimming with spoils and dungeons that keep the records of my failed platforming the rampant recycling gets old after a while you ll see the same bosses and crypts many times a big open world invites big concessions but it also lets players decide if they wish to participate don t like a particular boss or area leave it be for now think laterally to digress in search for power is only diegetic and it never wore thin for me everything is interwoven stapled by the hardships deepening what could otherwise be a laborious checklist ordeal a good fightthe complex synergies between the mechanics carry the combat system on their shoulders i jokingly describe its stamina based nature as chain smokers break each other s arthritic joints but it s a perfectly gamey concession a good fight forces you to learn thy enemy s patterns while leaving room for reaction and preparation it s a game of delays and commitments that teaches you to make split second predictions and hone hard earned improvisational skill at higher levels of play but your best skill is patience enjoy dying until you go slo mo and your efforts culminate in a spectacular catharsis after doing most things right most for you don t have to fight clean healing flasks allow for mistakes and you re given a bunch to facetank like there s no tomorrow regardless combat is tactical and visceral reminiscent of dancing rather than a brawl a good fight looks like a chaotic mess initially with each attempt come more recognised patterns often the only thing it changes is that you die with a smug expression on your face the violence is so good it makes one emotional except killing mini bosses like trolls and dragons quickly becomes stale how a hyena takes down a rhino stick to the nutsack there s never a reason to leave their crotch areas and the same tactic works for most i pity the giants of this world seeing them used as cannon fodder slaves or food now this all the thrashing beasts are lovely though tree sentinel mvp and the main bosses are as good as they come some suck but the general consensus is that they rocked everyone s world all have banger themes and balletic attacks of hypnotic grace most of them behave evident telegraphs ample openings okay hitboxes short runbacks modest grabs and tracking attacks not a lot of cheapness like adds or pits margit is body pillow material i loved hated malenia both mohg fights are superb rennala is mid albeit her knightly sister rellana paid her family dues in full dlc bosses are fire in all midra is so technical rhythmic and messmer well his fancy spear shreds that cheap triffid nearby guess who s ba no spoilers let s wrap wrapwhether i clutched or choked my hands were shaking of suspense elden ring takes away your faith at the start then returns that investment step by step earned this time you enter its waters a mentally deficient scrub emerge a mentally deficient god go get mad death blighted let a swamp swallow your runes see your body torn by birds under the crimson skies weep when it s over currently nothing else provides as a fulfilling an adventure apart from brain trauma from s vision has been outlandishly ambitious since king s field their creed is one of travail their game is aurora borealis at this time of year at this time of day
