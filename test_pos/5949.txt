2020 positive aspects crossplay with a huge online community killer and survivor are 2 different modes in one game hugely entertaining game content is huge going from skins maps perks to killers and survivors negative aspects performance is abysmal for older devices the amount of bugs is bigger than my iq it s not that bad introductiondead by daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where one of the 5 players takes the role of the bloodthirsty killer and the rest of the players do take the role of the survivors trying to fix engines in order to unlock the exit gate the game was developed and published by behaviour interactive release date 14th june 2016last known update 1st december 2020 small talk is the game even balanced smalltalknow many people do have questions about balance in asymmetrical games games like friday 13th had the problem of the killer being too strong while the newly released resident evil resistance is a cakewalk for the survivors dead by daylight on the other hand actually managed to become a truly balanced game back in 2016 and 2017 it was clearly a survivor focused experience but with many updates they managed to create a very pleasant and truly balanced experience gameplay after almost reaching 400 hours in dead by daylight and reaching rank 1 as a survivor and reaching red ranks as a killer i decided to review this game survivor gameplay the main idea is pretty simple you as the survivor will work and complete 5 engines that are scattered throughout the map after completing these engines you will have to find one of the 2 exit gates and pull the gate trigger until they open it sounds simple but you do have to realize that a killer will give you problems while trying to complete the engines now you may ask what can the survivor do in order to fight against the killer you do have multiple available game tactics while using perks and items there is a build that does allow you to run a killer for a lot longer other builds allow you to hide and make the killer lose time searching for you and lastly you got builds that do allow you to help your teammates obviously there are a lot more builds but these are the most common ones items have multiple uses honestly toolboxes and their add ons do assists you at either breaking hooks are working faster on engines medkits do allow you to heal up pretty fast and the flashlight has multiple uses against killers or blinding killers you can even save a survivor friend from the killer s grasp the map obviously offers interactive areas for the survivors you do have pallets that you can throw on the killer if you do happen to succeed in hitting the killer with a pallet you will successfully stun him for a couple of seconds youtube video dead by daylight survivor gameplay views 52 steam

will have to kill all of the survivors simple right well not really as a killer you should know when to chase and when not to chase there are certain areas in each map that are basically built to make the killer lose time one good example is the killer shack and is basically build for the strengths of the survivor usually you should avoid this building just like the survivors you do get the options to run a variety of builds one difference is the fact that some perks do work exclusively with totems these totems are usually lit which means that survivors usually tend to break them killers cannot use any items other than their unique abilities but they can use offerings and add ons just like the survivors in order to completely kill a survivor you will have to hook him 3 times lastly if you have killed 3 of the 4 survivors you can try to find the hatch which works basically as a secondary exit for the survivors if you find it first you can simply close it after that the 2 exit gates will be powered youtube video dead by daylight killer gameplay views 53 steam review setup amd ryzen 7 3700x 4 5ghz coolermaster masterliquid ml240l rgb 32gb 3200mhz corsair vengeance pro rgb gigabyte aorus other aspects a mori is a very powerful offering that allows the killer to kill a survivor after his second hook the game offers custom modes as well basically playing with friends dead by daylight offers daily challenges as well as weekly ones the weekly ones usually tend to give insight and a small story for each character doesn t matter if it s a killer of a survivor story the survivors are pulled into the entity s constructed world when they wander too close to the places the killers were taken from disappearing from the real world without a trace they end up at a lonely campfire where they rest between trials until a killer pursues them again this basically is an endless cycle each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the entity of areas from where the killers were taken the survivors only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape if the killer has killed all but one survivor the entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch escaping from the grounds always takes the survivors back to the campfire and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the entity s favor since the entity feeds off the hope of the survivors to escape it helps them just as much as the killers acting as an impartial observer of the hunt stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks the entity is the essence of evil basically graphics audio the game makes use of unreal engine 4 which gives this game a unique and creepy look obviously not the best looking game but it does look decent enough graphics every killer has a unique kill animation after using a mori this is a licensed killer and the detail is truly magnificent a screenshot of dead by daylight by sermike audio soundtrack the audio is pretty basic yet extremely effective every time you re being chased by the killer the chase music starts playing basically adding the sense of danger to the game the more distance you build the more the chase music lessens in volume until there is no chase anymore the survivors do make grunting sounds while being injured and so do the killers after being hit with a pallet some killers do have licensed music as well and it truly is a very good addition the game is truly awesome when it comes to the audio part performance sadly the performance is terrible when it comes to some older devices or even mid range devices which is crazy when you consider that this game doesn t even look that amazing in game amd ryzen 5 3700x 4 5ghz 32gb ram 3200 mhz nvidia rtx 2070 super 8gb 500gb nvme western digital i was running the game on maxed out settings in 1080p with120fps some people with gtx 1050ti s and gtx 760s tend to go under 30fps in certain maps which is just crazy in my opinion benchmarkshere docs google com bugs glitches crashes in 370 hours of annoying poor killers i had a plethora of game breaking bugs and many many glitches luckily with the most recent updates the game has become a lot more stable even with low end devices conclusion dbd currently is the best asymmetrical multiplayer game available the depth of the mechanics and skill set is just amazing as well as the community sadly bad performance and bugs make this game a hit or miss for some people overall rating 81 100 date of
