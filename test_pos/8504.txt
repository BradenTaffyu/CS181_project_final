2020 great program huge selection of community wallpapers it comes with an editor which is fairly easy to use once you get the idea the program itself only uses very few resources performance depends on the wallpaper you choose easy to use performance great community editor steam workshop sharing pause when full screen application is running doesn t take away resources from gaming playlist and auto change good filtering options fair price could have more animation features in the editor if started before steam it sometimes needs to be restarted in order to detect steam highly recommended
