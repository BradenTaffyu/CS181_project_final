2023 i ve played this game for 114 hours but this review isn t about me rather it s about a friend he was in a call trying to prove to me that nothing could go wrong while casting completely random spells i tried convincing him he was wrong unfortunately our hero didn t listen his fatal flaw of hubris led him to casting a nuke which he somehow arced at an angle that didn t kill him this was his first warning following this he cast two random spells that did literally nothing he then proceeded to say one more time just for good measure it was at this moment he just so happened to roll the spell that instantly turns everything in its radius into gold including you hubris is a fatal flaw kids don t forget that 10 10 would recommend to any finnish pyromaniac sociopaths
