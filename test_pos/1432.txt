2023 no amount of beating around the bush is going to get around the fact that this game had a rough launch but it s been a year since then and the devs have not stopped working on improving the game since then and won t for the foreseeable future as was the case with other total war games warhammer 3 will remain in development for years to come as the devs update older content and add new content to the game in the form of free downloadable content and paid dlc both so if you re looking for a definitive experience you won t find it here with that said at this point this game has improved so much since its launch that i can confidently say i d rather load up a new wh3 campaign than go back to playing wh2 even though i m a wh2 veteran of 2500 hours the maps of wh3 are better the features are better and the gameplay is still best in class and as such i will gladly recommend total war warhammer 3 as the first game to buy from this franchise and as a psa the franchise frequently goes on sale i would highly recommend keeping an eye out for sales both on and off of steam as you can often save quite a bit of money currently most items are 50 off on steam as of this review
