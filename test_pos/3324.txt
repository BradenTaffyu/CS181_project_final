2017 just to get one point out of the way i am reviewing this game as a single player experience i haven t really experienced the online part more than playing through the introduction but there are a lot of other steam reviews mentioning online play and according to some of them and some youtubers rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent players so yeah if you want info on the online experience check out other comments and reviews as for gta 5 s story mode and single player experience i feel it is a great gta game and certainly worth a buy for those that are a fan of the feel and gameplay of the series though there are some things i wish would have been a bit different that scene the torture scene now i am not against extreme and uncomfortable scenes in games if they serve a proper purpose however this didn t really serve any purpose for me i already knew at this point in the game that the character was deranged and a despicable human being controlling him as he tortured someone for information couldn t possibly lower my opinion of him any further i feel like this scene was simply put in to generate controversy about the game and get people talking so more people would buy the game because of the controversy which in truth it did get a lot of people talking when the game first came out so yay didn t really do anything for the story you already knew the agencies in gta were corrupt you knew trevor was the evilest character in the game nothing was really achieved other than making the player torture someone the charactersthen there are the three main characters themselves which i feel was a mistake i much prefer just playing as one character especially with michael being the most interesting gta protagonist i have played so far the most interesting supporting cast is also closely related to michael mainly his dysfunctional family i would have preferred the game focusing more on him possibly just making franklin a heist member and turning trevor into the main antagonist of the game franklin suffers from the same problem that cj had in gta san andreas he is just really boring unlike cj though most of the characters around franklin are boring too mostly just coming into the story to remind him that he isn t black enough and giving up on the hood because he is trying to get out of there and move up in the world cj at least had the best antagonists i have seen in the series and an insane but also hilariously over the top girlfriend ex girlfriend franklin he has a special ability that makes racing easier other than that he can be easily replaced by every other character plus switching between other characters franklin will often switch to ugly baggy clothes like some teenager trying to be cool so i constantly have to run back home to change his outfit to something that makes him look half decent as for trevor it is really weird playing as the most messed up and psychotic character in a gta game usually you play a guy like franklin or michael clearly both guys doing bad things but they are the kind of bad guys you send in to deal with the even worse guys trevor is as close as you get to a bad guy and i can best describe him as the joker of the gta universe for sake we are introduced to him killing a guy because the guy is upset that trevor is his girlfriend note the guy does not take the first hostile action trevor does when the guy doesn t instantly off trevor has no real redeeming qualities and by all accounts he should be the main bad guy at the end of the game because he is often the main cause of conflict then there are the villains with three main characters all switching between the spotlight there aren t much time left to let any villain shine which results in a series of smaller forgettable bad guys especially since trevor is often just on the verge of being a full on villain to michael which is a shame seeing as san andreas had amazing villains and a great climax the gta 5 climax is more meh a great thing is that you can give all of the protagonists glorious beards which really helps improve their ugly faces stay positiveokay so that was the negatives out of the way now for the more positive the gameplay feels much more smooth to me than it has in previous titles everything is nice and easy to control once you get the hang of it well possibly except for helicopters but i will never learn to properly fly and land those things in gta p i also like the skills of the various characters such as driving and shooting and that certain ones of them are relatively fast to level up especially flying at the flying school it is nice that they haven t brought back annoying stats like fat so the core of the gameplay is very enjoyable and the other drivers have improved a lot too in previous games if i tried to drive normal waiting on traffic lights driving in the correct lanes matching the speed of the other cars which i often do in missions where the characters are having conversations i would often get slammed into by cars deciding to make a sudden turn in about 60 hours of gta 5 i didn t experience that happening even once to myself though i did see a few others driving into other cars but not into me by accident there are also several random encounters which spice up the city and make it feel alive some are just people wanting to get driven places and give a few bucks but some are more interesting or funny for example i suddenly saw hostiles on the map and decided to check it out because i hadn t really done anything to warrant hostiles at that time after shooting them it turned out i saved a girl from being murdered over her dad s criminal past and after driving her home i was later contacted getting 60 000 put into the character s account which i felt was a lot for a random encounter there are also some great songs mixed into the different radio stations since i have been watching archer a lot lately i was really excited when i suddenly heard they were playing danger zone by kenny loggins a lot of the minigames are also fun side distractions personally i found playing tennis as michael to be very relaxing end remarksso yeah two out of three protagonists suck the antagonists aren t very fleshed out or memorable the core of the game is great the city feels more alive and the radio has good songs mixed in
