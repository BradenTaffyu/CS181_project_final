2018 better than destiny 2 no but seriously as a free to play game you don t have to spend a dime to get all relevant and new gear you can to take a quick short cut or if you d like some pretty swaggy cosmetics to personalize your warframe ship weapons and living quarters probably the pinnacle of free to play done right in the last decade edit for those of you asking the comparsion to d2 is a joke if you can t take a joke stay off the internet if you took it seriously you showed your stupidity secondly you could very heavily compare destiny 2 and warframe to each other if you really wanted to the only drastic different between the two is 1st vs 3rd person they are both semi mmo like with vast spaces to explore with lots of looting shooting and character abilties if you don t see the similarities you should have your eyes checked warframe was one of the first emerging always online looter shooter genre games
