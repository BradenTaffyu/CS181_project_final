i actually tried this game twice before on gamepass but due to a tragic affliction known as a skill issue i really struggled with the perfect guard block style of combat however i decided to buy the game and stick at it and i am glad i did these devs clearly love fromsoft games as this is a pure souls like through and through though based loosely on the fable of pinocchio which gives it a unique vibe all of its own the setting of the fictional city of krat is fantastic particularly enjoyable to me are the early parts of the game where they really give you the sense of a world destroyed by a puppet uprising robots really and a deadly disease outbreak that wreaked havoc on the world the combat relies more on sekiro like blocking than souls style rolling and parrying etc and while this can be great it often is hard to read enemies and get the timing and rolling is not effective until you upgrade it and you won t have enough resources quartz to upgrade rolling until at least a second playthrough this is where i think lies of p limits its audience to an extent the combat is punishingly difficult at times and you pretty much have to master the perfect blocking style of combat or you re going to have a difficult time once you do however you can stagger enemies for critical hits or backstabs and much like the dark souls games satisfying backstabs on unaware enemies are perfectly implemented here and feel very familiar stamina management is also essential here and probably the most unforgiving of any souls game i have played so far i really enjoyed the early levels of this game but found the last levels starting to get tedious and on my second run through i found myself simply running past a lot of enemies just to get through areas where i didn t need any items to fully complete my run getting knocked off of thin platforms and having to fight tough mini boss level enemies while being ranged attack spammed is something i will never enjoy in souls like games i did find some of the voice acting absolutely awful but it is something i notice a lot of these asian korean games do like in final fantasy games in my limited experience where the characters talk in a weird way that is not at all how people actually talk to each other though overall it still is passable as it kinda adds to the unique vibe of the game and i don t primarily play souls likes for the voice acting worth mentioning the game runs incredibly well and mostly bug free while not pushing the limits of graphics tech it still looks really nice for an unreal 4 game and i had a constant 120 fps without any stutter and i think this will be pretty unforgiving on even older systems the sound was nice too and i actually decided to leave the music on i usually mute music in games and i liked the dreamy music that plays at the central hub of hotel krat the games version of firelink shrine oh and thinking of firelink the game does some classic fromsoft level design things like linking levels back to the central hotel area along with the obligatory shortcuts and secrets you expect in a souls game overall i highly rate lies of p but the big problem it has that will put off a lot of people is the difficulty for me personally this game is the hardest souls like i have tried other than sekiro which i just could not get to grips with though i plan to try that again too it is a shame too as these souls likes are also great rpgs and i encourage anyone curious to look at mods to make these games easier if they want to play them as they are well worth experiencing a flawed gem of a souls like and the best non fromsoft souls game i have tried in my opinion
