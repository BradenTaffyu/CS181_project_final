2015 mine aint nothin special but it gets the job done trevorwhere to begin let s start out with the hype around this game while no game can truely live up to it all this game certainly comes close the single player sorry story mode is what you d expect from a gta game these days long fun and somewhat captivating there s some silly moments in it not quite san andreas level but pretty close that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes while i haven t even came close to completing the game at the time of this review i still feel the game was worth the 39 99 i payed now gta online oh boy it s hard to explain or even define but there s something about online that makes it addictive much like your skyrims you re constantly wanting to get better stuff be that cars boats helicopters jets weapons or clothes you re always after something new yes there are lobbies with much higher level players in there destroying us newer players but they re not that frequent even when in one you ll have some enjoyment getting your revenge or go into passive mode while i brought the game for the story mode i m finding myself focusing more on the online play there s some issues with lobbies randomly being emptied in short you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the rockstar servers claiming your rig or connection can t handle the current lobby but you can still join jobs with others no problem in short i d highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone it s great fun has humour and is excellent value for money
