first impressions were that the dlc was way too hard i ended up walking away from some bosses to collect the items needed to become stronger and returning to the boss later it paid off this is a masterpiece anyone who leaves a negative review for difficulty is either just being ignorant or lazy the artwork cinematic work views weapons armour locations are all incredible in my honest opinion it isn t better than the base game but it is a wonderful addition p s elden ring was my first fromsoftware game
