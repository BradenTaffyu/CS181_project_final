2023 the gameplay style promotes toxicity on both sides exposing new players to the worst that the other side has to offer if you play survivor early on you will meet a mask wearing inbred texan who loves hook assisted involuntary eye contact who is also still very much butthurt from their previous round if you play killer early on you will find yourself against a group of no less than 4 teabagging ttv survivors with matching outfits and clan tags who run endurance perks and bring event flashlights for no other reason than to permanently elevate your blood pressure once exposed to the rampant toxicity you will find yourself trying to inflict as much genuine real life misery on the opposing player s as this one game allows this is a problem that is built into the gameplay loop it has been a problem since the open beta and will continue to be a problem until behaviour interactive goes bankrupt you uninstall or the sun explodes whichever happens first from a perspective of a casual player this is nothing short of a 30 voluntary human rights violation from the perspective of a psychologist this is the most effective long term social experiment on aggression stress and human nature that has not been shut down by the government yet i have been called slurs that haven t been spoken aloud since 1712 if i see that a survivor has added me as a steam friend after i play a killer match i block them not out of smug superiority but out of genuine fear i know that if i add them back there is a roughly 80 chance that they send me a well crafted thesis criticizing everything from my perk choices on ghostface to how ugly my dog is and then immediately unfriend me never to be seen again the subject matter is beyond tame compared to some of the fanbase i fear no digital monsters nor pixellated murderers anymore for i now know that true evil lies in the hearts of men 9 10
