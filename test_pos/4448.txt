2023 i have been playing this game for a while and to be honest its really good this is the only game of which i always find myself returning to after a while and then getting instantly hooked again this game is clearly amazing on a lot of aspects the graphics are astonishing the gameplay is exciting and fun its challenging a lot of times etc of course there are some downsides as all games have at least one sadly the story is a lot of times confusing i cannot really understand most of the time what is happening story wise and its also quite forgetful also the achievements on this game are on another level one requires you to revive 1000 allies one to drive with the k drive 1mil meters and the master rank ones are just a nightmare overall though it is really worth playing it and can be really fun and interesting
