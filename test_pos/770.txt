2022 this game i enjoyed very much and hated very much it s an old game but graphics and sound is no problem the problem is the community at least that was the reason i stopped playing it i wasn t bad in any way never played competitive or anything teambased just casual in and kill as many as you can before you get killed i like that playstyle and it worked my k d ratio is definitely on the plus side but the community well anyone who played it know cheating cursing and everything possible to make a good game to boring but i will never touch it again
