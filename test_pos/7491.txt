2020 oh man sea of thieves i spent 1 for a month of xbox game pass to give sea of thieves a try and i fell in love i jumped on it on steam in july despite the game not even being on sale at the time just because i wanted to keep playing it the biggest gripe i have with sea of thieves is like many others the other players who choose to do pvp battle with you i ve gotten frustrated a lot simply because other players felt like engaging and they either have a better grasp of pvp than my crew does or their internet sucks it can be and is very demoralizing to spend half an hour or an hour on one voyage and lose all of that progress however thankfully the majority of sea of thieves players do not fall into that category most players want to do their own thing and not make the gamble to lose all of their progress so usually you won t even come into contact with other players or you might end up finding friendly players if you re aiming for pvp the arena game mode exists to provide pvp players the matches they re looking for in fact there are communities dedicated to setting up pve servers and having joined them a couple of times they can be well organized and very rewarding new pve content is being added to the game almost monthly new treasure hunts new story quests new world events and more all with unique gameplay mechanics that will keep you on your toes some players complain about all enemies are skeletons but honestly there s a lot of variety in both the skeleton types and the special skeletons like captains and ashen lords there s genuine feedback to be made about boss enemies being bullet sponges but other than that the fights are honestly very fun it s also really great to have the game put everyone at an equal skill level in terms of weapons and ships there s no way to upgrade anything for more power all of the loot goes towards more cosmetics which is risky because that means the developers put their entire stock in the gameplay loop being fun enough for players to keep coming back and it definitely paid off because the gameplay loop is definitely really fun while other players can be a nuisance at times i m always coming back to sea of thieves so much so that i easily paid real money for a pet dog i definitely recommend everyone gives sea of thieves a try by using the xbox game pass for 1 for a month and then making a decision from there
