2020 dead by daylight is a game you will love to hate and hate to love the game has come a long way since 2016 but still requires a considerable amount of time and effort to improve if you enjoy co op games with a lot of potential room for mindgames and improvement then this will be a great title for you to at least try out with a group of friends during free weekend or sales perhaps the game will stick with you during this time if you expect every game to be smooth sailing without the occassional camper or dodgy matchmaking then this might not be a game for you as is with every game that has online matchmaking the game s price is pretty ok for what you get although a lot of perks characters and cosmetics are behind dlc paywalls however said perks etc are for a large part obtainable with currency that can be earned in game by playing matches without spending a single euro at least it is clear that the developers want to sculpt the game into something better and continue to do so for the forseeable future i d say they did a pretty good job so far
