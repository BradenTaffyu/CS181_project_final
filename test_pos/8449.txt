2020 i bought it thinking that i will spend no more than 30 hours in it currently i have over 300 hours and i am having fun not only browsing the wallpapers but also creating them you can really create whatever you want and what your imagination allows when it comes to developer activity nothing bad can be said they are interested in their product and improve it the optimization is good especially because when you start another window the wallpaper pauses in the background for this price i can confidently recommend the product
