2023 hey ho i played apex since day 1 and i have to admit apex has its upsides and downsides but still it is my favourite game here is why i love the gameplay awesome character designs the weapons from titanfall that we loved and buitiful and colorful maps olympus kingscanyon stormpoint brokenmoon worldsedgelots of soundtracks to choose from to get you in the mood and recently also a lot of different gamemodes to play trios battleroyal where it all started duos battleroyal trios ranked battleroyal teamdeathmatch control gungameit is an awesome game but recently something is of i used to play apex with my bros playing ranked not to sweaty just to have some fun but now ranked is no good for fun way to sweaty lobbys and also no goals rewards for most of the modes teamdeathmatch control gungame over all the game feels like it just a feeding ground for all the master and predator players you are just waiting for a new season to come in hope that finally the game will make you smile again while playing but no i have the feeling since two or three seasons the game just gets worse even event are just cash events for ea this wasn t always the case we had rewards for arena a long gone mode and ranked was perfect for your fun time with the boys after a long day of work i used to play until platin and switched than to standard br for the rest of the season it was a good feeling to accomplish your goal at the end of the season and be hyped for the new content of the next one every event also braught extra fun you were hyped for the rewards that you could get by playing the last season gave us crossprogression something we waited like years for and i switched from xbox to pc but still ranked gets worse and worse yeah pro gamers will be like just play better but no this is not about pros its about the average person playing this game currently the only thing that binds me to apex are the memories i have to it and my girlfriend who just recently started playing it and she is the perfect example for the problem which apex currently has she improved a lot since she started playing she loves the characters favourite is lifeline she loves the gameplay and the guns skins music bit she absoulutly doesn t enjoy battleroyal and for a battleroyal that is a big problem it is apex main feature it should be the mode that makes you wanting to play this game but she doesn t enjoy it at all for new players to find themselfes and their comfort modes teamdeathmatch control gungame and to stay there is a huge problem for a battleroyal game but now let s get to the ingame story we had awesome stories to tell from the game the reconstruction of ash bangalores long lost brother new castle the infected ships arriving on olympus leviathans walking over kings canyon and now we have revenant and loba yes still revenant and loba since over ten seasons it s revenant and loba and i get annoyed every time i watch a new trailer why don t we get cool new stories there is so much they could do from wraith finding old memories about her past self to the remain of cryptos girlfriend and much more it is just repeating every season we want more lore and new stories even after all that apex is still my favourite game and i hope it will one day be as good as it used to be that i can have fun in ranked again with my bros and laugh with my best friend when he opens a apex pack and still has no heirloom since season 1 btw i write this comment so that it may reaches a lot of other players who think like me about this game and that it may even reaches respawn and changes something one day i want to smile again while playing and think my favourite game is apex legends
