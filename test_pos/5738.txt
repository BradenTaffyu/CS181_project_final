2021 reviewa very interesting alternative to counter strike the main advantage of the game is the ability to influence the environment which means that in this game it is not only aiming and reflexes that counts but also tactical sense this significantly increases the set of possible moves what s more thanks to such game mechanics it is much easier to deal with cheaters than in counter strike at the same time they are both a disadvantage and an advantage characters with individual skills it makes the game more colorful and increases the range of tactics at the same time make the risk of a lack of balance between the characters fortunately the developers deal with this problem amazingly well as a minus i consider walking away from realism and the move towards esports bright and garish skins colorful uniforms and weapons and some too sci fi skills in my opinion they spoil the atmosphere of the rainbow six saga summary advantages interactive environment destructible walls floors etc greate breachng mechanism characters with skills drone mechanics good friendly fire report and punishment system weapon accessories affecting the fire characteristics disdvantages character balance problem for new characters poor realism of the appearance of characters and weapons no possibility of punishing reporting people leaving the match toxic players
