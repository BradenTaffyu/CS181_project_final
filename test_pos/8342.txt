2020 early access review forgot to actually review this the best game that i m not great at you don t have to be great at noita to have a great time what makes noita shine is not any one of its parts but all of them together strange lore world building wacky wand setups both you and the enemies follow the same rules and the fully physical world if you think you came up with a creative way to use physics to your advantage or a really dumb wand setup you can do it if you ve ever thought you like secrets noita has so many secrets that there s more secrets in the game than there is main game and there s plenty of main game noita is like 6 games in one with how many and how diverse and wacky all of the secrets are mod support always a great plus especially in a game that lets you do so much noita is a crazy shining hidden gem
