2020 product received for free the journey is the rewardoverviewsea of thieves sot is an open world first person action adventure game where you can be a pirate as a pirate can be it promotes pvp and pve action side by side at the same time while its main focus is directed towards utilizing team play and heavy cooperation it s not about the gold it s about the glory there is no profound main story overshadowing the game but every island character treasure and chest is dipped in a piece of lore just to be expanded more and more with the upcoming dlcs meanwhile you can set sail towards grand adventures to uncover various secrets and how this archipelago was cursed by doing lengthy quests known as tall tales if you want to pursue the somewhat convoluted story take on them or perhaps you just want to be a damn pirate go for it the game gives you free rein to choose whether you want the lore or not and i think it is great in that manner the pirate lord giving you a pep talk on the last tall tale a screenshot of sea of thieves by amirite an altogether different meaning of cooperation you re given two modes to choose what type of adventure to start adventure the primary experience of sot this mode focuses on the pvpve aspect and consists of all the voyages events and everything the game has to offer players can choose any of the vessel sizes to start their journey sloop two man brigantine three man and galleon four man arena a full pvp mode that heavily revolves around naval battles in duo or quad play players fight each other against the clock for points loot and currencies treasures and gold can t be found so easily mostly you have to follow an x mark map and solve several amusing and brain tickling riddles or perhaps take on a more aggressive approach by looting an enemy ship these quests can be either bought or found lying along the shorelines the payment for quests and loots is deeply generous but there s nothing more than skins to buy soon you ll run out of things to buy in sot currency in the game is divided into three items gold most common currency obtained by selling loot used to purchase cosmetics items and quests doubloons awarded for completing commendations they can be exchanged with duke in taverns for special voyages and cosmetics ancient coins obtained via real money to buy from the emporium shop purely cosmetic also rarely dropped by ancient skeletons trading companies sot is dominated by three main trading companies knowns as gold hoarders merchant alliance and order of souls they each only buy certain types of loot from you should you choose a riskier yet more profiting way to bootleg your belongings the reaper s bones awaits you additionally another company athena s fortune is accessible to only pirate legends requires reaching level 50 in all three main companies you can do handbrake turns in a ship who knew sailing a ship has never been so realistic you re given a compass and the rest of the knowledge comes with time sails must be angled properly to adjust the speed repairing the ship requires agility or hours of work might sink in the bottom of the seas you must interact cooperatively with most of these elements to speed things up overall it s not as complex as it sounds the whole experience is easy to learn but hard to master no progression whatsoever the gameplay becomes monotonous since no ranking system or character progression is present on one hand it s a good starting point that all players are given the same gear and weapons and only skill would save them from death on the other hand it makes it difficult to spot decent pirates and have productive journeys with random people the heart of pve is numerous world events that take you through epic naval battles or set you and your crew off to fight skeletons and solve riddles smaller events such as hunting megalodons or the kraken occurs randomly in the sea while major ones like ashen lords or ghost fleets will stay around until they re completed the events are considered as a great challenge and are almost impossible to come through without seasoned crewmates bosses are um too tanky most events end with a boss fight these encounters could be often intense as each one has different stages and summons minions during the fight however they lose their variety soon because all bosses share the same set of attacks and moves their huge health pool is just a hit it until it s dead situation that bores you to death needless to say the melee system feels lackluster and basic boss fights are chaotic and intense but are also extremely tanky and require no strategy to defeat compared to the hefty loots they drop a screenshot of sea of thieves by amirite joining publics is unnerving the fact that no lobby joining option is implemented in the game after 2 years of development is what bothers me the most no info is given when joining a game such as latency the ongoing quest etc you cannot cancel the joining process once you start searching for a crew getting more technical hud is minimalist with absolutely no intrusive elements cluttering the screen and your view for more immersion sot offers a considerable amount of accessibility features to aid anyone with the slightest disability to enjoy the game features like text to speech narrating ui elements various colorblind filters etc that distinguish sot from other titles all contents could be exhausted within 200 hours if played efficiently but bear in mind due to rng factors of quests and events the replayability is immensely high sun sands sea at first glance the cartoonish style might put you off but to be fair the visuals are extraordinary and breathtaking the water effects and physics are phenomenally realistic the days are brightened with cheerful colors it s practically impossible not to take a minute to gaze upon the stunning sunrises sunsets while sailing the seas the nights are filled with stars and auroras that never lose their charm and are somewhat gloomy in a good way during naval battles the music intensifies the situation with epic pieces similar to the pirates of the caribbean also you can set up the greatest radio station ever bring out your instruments play shanties and sing along with your crewmates the sea of thieves is vast and eye popping plenty of sceneries like this make you take a moment and admire the work put into
