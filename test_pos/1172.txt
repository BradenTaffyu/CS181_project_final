2023 overall elden ring was a positive experience for me the variety of spells and equipment it offers and the amount of builds you can do makes it one of those games worth revisiting despite its length while the non linear structure of the open world allows you to make your new adventure flow completely different from the previous one unfortunately elden ring is not without its issues and at least for me personally there s quite many i won t go into every detail since i admit that a lot of them may come down to a preference but here s two big problems i believe most people who ve also played the game will agree on by the second half of your playthrough it will become very noticable how the game almost crumbles under its own size which results in repeating enemies dungeons and bosses not to mention the fact that fromsoftware already reuse some of the content from their previous games i understand that it was a compromise to keep the world as big as it is but it also doesn t make interacting with those on repeating encounters any less dull the quest system in this game is pure nonsense and no this isn t me advocating for the introduction of quest markers first in many cases once you progress a quest to the next stage the npc you re looking for will move to a completely different place on the map without giving you even a slight indication where to find them secondly the directions they give you for their tasks are often vague at best too and often you won t even realize you did or found something that can prompt another interaction e g sorceress sellen s quest line basically the probability of you finishing some of the quests in elden ring comes down to pure luck unless you re following a guide it s the opposite extreme i m not a fan of but fromsoftware pretty much force you to choose between the two i could go on and on about the issues i listed above as well as some of the more subjective ones but i think this review is long enough as it is like i said in the beginning i had a good time with elden ring and despite its problems i think the game is well worth your time and the asking price
