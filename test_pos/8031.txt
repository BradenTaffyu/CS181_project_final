2019 early access review as someone who played hours and hours of the powder toy game this is basically the dream i always had while i was playing that a rogue like game a ton of secrets and fully destructible environment the game itself is a lot of fun and the best way to describe it would be a mix of terraria spelunky powder toy dead cells i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys falling sand type games
