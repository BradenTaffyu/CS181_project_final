2017 i liked this game since it was on beta it has a good concept very fun to play with friends i enjoy sometimes just playing on my own as a killer too devs improved the game a lot since the beta they update a lot release good and appreciated dlcs the price is justified especially on sale i am happy for spending my money on this game it s worth it the only bad side imo is the lag you can find the killer is the hoster so if he has bad internet heh the match will be badly affected and sometimes is very annoying since this game has qte actions a few bugs here and there that i see slowly getting fixed but nothing that serious to ruin the fun 8 10
