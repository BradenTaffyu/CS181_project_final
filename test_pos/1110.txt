2022 a brief introductionlet s get a few things straightened out here you know what elden ring is i don t have to explain it i have fully beaten elden ring twice i think it is overall a good game but it is not a masterpiece like you may have heard it has its amazing upsides but significant downsides as well i want you the reader to decide if this game is right for you in depth analysisgameplaylet s get started with the basics elden ring s core gameplay loop is the fromsoft souls classic you attack the enemy and roll to dodge through attacks however it is also sort of an amalgamation of all previous popular fromsoft games the stealth from sekiro returns as well as the jump button the speed of combat returns from ds3 and bloodborne with enemies faster than ever before and long forgotten mechanics from the underappreciated dark souls 2 return like powerstancing the ability to combine two weapons of the same class for a unique dual wield moveset frankly there are too many mechanics to cover in a review that has a character limit but the core of the combat is still the same as before if you like dark souls bloodborne or sekiro you ll most likely like this however as you know elden ring is open world a first for fromsoft this means that enemies can come from anywhere at any time you have to be on alert constantly or else you can easily find yourself stuck in a massive ambush on the plus side this means a lot of player engagement and freedom but on the other hand it means a lot of content is missable or frankly not worth your time any dungeon you encounter can either gift you with your new favorite weapon a core spell for your arsenal or even a fantastic new talisman or that same dungeon could give you something completely irrelevant to your current build like a katana for your strength pure or a faith weapon on your sorcerer this makes exploring and discovering a treat but also somewhat tedious and often kills replayability what s the point in going through an open world full of secrets when you know every secret and know 90 of them aren t important where the game truly shines are in its legacy dungeons giant sprawling fortresses and cities reminiscent of sekiro or the levels of the souls series the perfectly paced enemies dense layout and unlockable shortcuts and checkpoints make them a joy to go through but on the negative side the rest of the dungeons range from alright to outright miserable the vast majority of them follow the same cookie cutter design of cramped tomb tunnels or dug out caves and they get old pretty fast that leads to a core criticism of the gameplay as a whole while the core loop is quite enjoyable you ll soon realize a lot of assets get reused throughout the game many minibosses are simply late game common enemies with a health bar that give mediocre rewards on defeat some enemy types are continuously reskinned to suit the new area as an example the basic soldier enemy is reskinned to be a regional soldier for nearly every single area in the game with little to no change in moveset regardless of their army or colors some minibosses are re used up to 10 times and it gets very tiresome to see the new flavor of the month reskin after reaching the end of another copy and paste dungeon but the biggest criticism i have for the game is the bosses with bloodborne ds3 and sekiro fromsoft showed they have the true talent for making a memorable and difficult but balanced boss experience sadly they dropped the ball somewhat for elden ring many bosses are rather cheap in nature relying on insanely heavily delayed animations to bait and catch rolls or on input reading an ai tactic where the enemy reacts the same frame you press a button to give them the perfect response at your detriment and beyond any human s possible reaction time endgame bosses especially feel heavily overtuned either crammed full of gimmicks like spraying lingering bleed inflicting flames on the ground healing on every hit and inflicting hp drain or simply having gargantuan health bars and dealing 900 damage on every hit turning even a glancing blow into a sudden life or death situation sometimes the input reading and cheap tactics of various enemies outshines the positives community created artwork for steam artwork by xenos i still think the gameplay and bosses as a whole lean more on the positive side but they distinctly have their flaws and players need to remember to use every tool at their disposal even though it plays like a souls game it is not balanced like one and will severely punish you for assuming you can approach it like one storyas for the story it is quite excellent those familiar with fromsoft lore can expect the usual vageueness bits and pieces of scattered story to be found elden ring definitely has a much denser history compared to the souls series but that makes it more satisfying to piece together elden ring s story is arguably the hardest to understand of any fromsoft game but still has excellent story beats and lore to unveil a screenshot of elden ring by xenos and thankfully fromsoft provided us with a key npc gideon the all knowing to provide us key information about who we need to be killing and where they are his addition is invaluable as a player resource visualssimply put the game looks absolutely phenomenal i do have my distinct issue with the color palette that it clearly needs to remember colors other than gray exist in some areas especially in dungeons but the special effects and enemy designs are 100 on point the open world especially looks reasonably believable and realistic with every region having its distinct atmosphere that sets it apart from the others you can load into the game anywhere and immediately know where you are just based on your surroundings the best bosses of elden ring give such a spectacle you can t help but remember them community created artwork for steam artwork by xenos the remembrance bosses especially hold absolutely nothing back with strikingly unique designs and insane levels of sfx and color variety they alone help the game stand out audiothankfully no criticisms in this category weapons feel meaty attacks have weight and the music is still up to the historically excellent fromsoft standard not much needs elaborating look up the ost for godskin apostles or mohg lord of blood you ll be hooked in seconds technicalgeforce rtx 3050ti 4gb intel i7 16gb windows 10 elden ring is very demanding in the specs department and to top it off its capped at 60 fps even with good specs like mine i would still suffer frame drops in areas most concerningly the elden ring multiplayer servers at the moment are an absolute mess at pure random you can suffer a connection error and completely disconnect from your host whether you be invader or ally this is thanks to the horrible implementation of easy anti cheat i cannot physically count on all my digits how many times i was helping a host beat an endgame boss and got booted out of the session with zero warning either a mere minute after joining or significantly into the fight solo play using spirit ashes or npc summons is unaffected but temper your expectations if you re a career invader or sunbro conclusiona great game with some big flaws at the end of the day i had a net positive experience with elden ring the world was very enjoyable to explore and most of the major story bosses that actually had some thought put into them are very memorable and exciting however if you decide to play you need to be prepared for the rotten apples in the basket be willing to use every tool at your disposal to win because elden ring certainly will follow our curator page ocg curations if you like and want to see more reviews like
