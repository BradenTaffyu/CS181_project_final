2021 there is so much more to this game than meets the eye the basics you play as a mage you kill enemies with your wands spells you progress downward through levels and reach safe zones where you can purchase new wands spells and perks when you die it s game over and the entire game restarts quite literally due to the design if you progress far enough you ll reach the end game boss defeat said boss to achieve victory sounds simple enough right well you have one life and there are no saves zero hand holding the game tells you the controls and off you go to explore and die enemies do not around they will wreck your bosses laugh at you and ragdoll your corpse if you re not prepared everything else can and will kill you you ll think you re having a good run then bam death by falling rocks exploding barrels hidden traps lava acid electricity panicking pressing the wrong key at the wrong time the list goes on and on pros wand building and player perks there s a huge variety of spells for your wands as well as player perks spells can be linked together in weird and wonderful ways for maximum carnage it s insanely fun and dangerous experimenting with different spell and perk combinations exploration and secrets without spoiling too much the game is a lot larger than it appears try going off the beaten track and see what you can find there s a lot of secrets to be discovered some are massively cryptic though so i found myself having to search for answers online enemies and bosses awesome variety of enemies with unique stats and abilities you ll find yourself learning enemy behaviour and capabilities a spell which is effective against one enemy might be totally useless against another pure destruction everything in the game can be destroyed in one way or another solid rock can be nuked into oblivion liquids turned into gas and flammable items burned so you can unleash your inner pyro potions liquids you can collect all kinds of liquids in bottles which act as utility items for example some put out fires while others provide temporary buffs and debuffs there s so much more i want to say but it s way more fun and rewarding discovering these things for yourself cons rng can be a sometimes the random spells wands or potions you find might be undesirable depending on your situation on the flipside it pushes you to adapt and figure out how to make it work in your favour there s also a certain event which makes all of the safe zones very unsafe i won t say what it is or how it happens but it s normally triggered by you the player sometimes it can seemingly happen at random and will make the remainder of your run a lot more painful singular pixels it s not uncommon to accidentally explode yourself because you did not see a single pixel right in front of you during a fight it s also quite easy to become blocked or trapped by a single pixel while you re manoeuvring or fleeing no saves or difficulty setting i personally do not think this is a bad thing but others might the game is designed to be challenging and harsh you will die easily and frequently losing everything after many hours of hard work can be really frustrating but that s the nature of the game overall noita is an amazing game with an incredible amount of depth it will punish you over and over but you ll keep coming back for more
