2015 a very competitive tactical multiplayer fps youtube video counter strike global offensive first competitive match views 364 i had no idea this game was going to take so long developer valve join my steam group twitter plenty of well designed maps visually very appealing very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day the arms race or gun game mode is a favorite of mine essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun nice selection of guns great sound effects a bit too competitive people take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim some might love this others may hate this aspect you die extremely fast in this game and can not regain health very repetitive there isn t many game modes and you mainly end up playing bomb defusal which is basically search destroy if you are more familiar with call of duty microtransactions skins which are very costly i feel like counter strike lacks features that other shooters have ads aiming down site vehicles gametypes killstreaks leveling progression unlock systems destructable environments going prone sliding leaning etc in competitive play a large portion of time is spent watching others play after you die you must wait for the round to finish by spectating others keep in mind these are opinions
