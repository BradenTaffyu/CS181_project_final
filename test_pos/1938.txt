its a great game but has become stale even with the seasons there s not much to do and with the latest patch it feels like single players are being targeted and made to feel unwanted as can no longer complete the game with the bosses being made level 60 and requires a team to beat the servers are too small so cant even play with friends the promised to make them bigger but as of yet no luck beginning to feel lied to tbh the building is very annoying and often doesnt work its a shame as i love the game nut just feel targeted for being a single player as the recent patch update as made it so unless you can find people to play with you will not be able to complete the game before the wipe
