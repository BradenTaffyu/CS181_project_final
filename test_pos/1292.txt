2022 my first fromsoft game and this is a 10 10 imo i m not great at reviews so here are my pros and cons pros exploration amazing there seems to be something in every inch of the map this can range from rare items located in spots you wouldn t think hidden bosses dungeons quests or just really cool set pieces i m 40 hours in and i feel like i ve hardly pushed the main story due to getting side tracked combat b as i said this is my first fromsoft game so i had no experience with the souls franchise outside of watching streams it s fun a lot of fun there s a slight curve but it mainly comes down to knowing timing for attacking and dodging parrying bosses can be dominating but it s great that you can leave explore come back and sometimes the fight just clicks co op while not ideal i hear this is a fromsoft staple it can be a lot of fun it s slightly tricky to set up at first one player makes a sign the one who wants to join and the other uses an item to see that sign in the same location the host if you are brought to someone else s world your flasks are cut in half so keep that in mind co op is built more for defeating big enemies if you beat a boss or maybe a main boss only the session ends rather than exploring as you can t use mounts in the open world when together but this doesn t mean it isn t fun to run around with your friends visuals just 10 10 story it s there and very interesting but like other soul games you have to dig a bit outside of main encounters and cutscenes to get the full picture there are a few locations that tell a story based on npc placements buildings etc which are very cool too cons i don t have many but the big one is that currently performance is hit or miss in a huge range for different pcs while it seems everyone gets frame drops it s a shame but still playable imo some get massive screen tearing a friend and i with similar pcs had wildly different experiences mine being the more stable only frame drops now and then the other thing is that if you don t like dark souls as a concept you most likely won t like this one bosses are punishing it can take hours sometimes to figure out the strategy and timing that works for you but this game does help with that frustration a little bit because it s an open world leave level up explore and come back when you feel like it all in all this is my goty
