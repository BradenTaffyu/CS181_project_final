2022 do you enjoy roguelikes have you ever enjoyed games that give you no immediate understanding of the mechanics do you enjoy facing impossible odds made worse by greed fuelled mistakes do you hold a deep self hatred towards yourself that gets worse every time you consider your recent choices of course you do welcome to noita and enjoy your misery noita is essentially a full blown git gud roguelike physics based wizard simulator that forces you between two extremes of methodical decision making and planning ahead and split second panic choices that can end your run anywhere between your starting point to five hours in you will get lit on fire and burn to death before you can put it out you will get sniped from offscreen by a gang of enemies and inevitably you will try to open a chest in a small pool of water only to get electrocuted to death by the item that spawned from it your hand will not be held and you will need fanatical willpower or sheer insanity to continue after dying to a combination of unfortunate events comprised of poor wand and item spawns terrible perk rerolls and environmental hazards that enemies have no issues using against you to scatter your corpse across the screen but as you keep climbing up the mountain of knowledge this game requires and the spell system starts to make sense and knowing where to go and what to plan for becomes second nature you realize this game will still end you within a minute by your own hands and you ll start it again just to have something out of your control kill you the next time and you ll start again anyway
