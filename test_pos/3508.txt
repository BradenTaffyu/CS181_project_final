2015 so i haven t played any gta since gta 2 1997 and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didn t care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try honestly i m blown away in regards to how good this game actually is the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing i have only a few hours in so far but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is and look forward to playing it for many hours more
