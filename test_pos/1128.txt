after playing the ds trilogy exclusively back to back i decided that the next game should be elden ring as it is close regarding the gameplay the game started and it was from the beginning very familiar given of course the new stuff and the items that were similar to those from older games that worked however differently to an extend and it felt like it was going to be an amazing adventure already and it was the numerous locations were very different from each other thus giving a big diversity from one location to the next the weapons available seemingly having an endless variety and the smaller details like day night and the weather really made a big and good impression i decided to approach the game like every other open world game i have played in the past explore as much as possible in this case finding as many sites of grace as possible and then start exploring and did i explore searched every little corner every hole every dungeon every plain and every castle excited to see what i am going to find very nice variety very nice ambient music interesting enemies and amazing epic bosses battles and for the most part the game was great but it was just that normally with a game of that genre like i did with the ds games i would describe my experience but this game is too big to do that so i believe that just being one more voice stating how good the game is is good enough however i would have to note some aspects that i didnt really enjoy and some that affected my time with the game in a bad way starting with the worst one i played the game on steam deck and during almost my whole playthrough i was being put in offline mode which after some search about it found out it s a problem of the game a problem that it hasnt been addressed yet i didnt experience not even one invasion for example the other kind of issue i had with the game is mostly based on my point of view what i didnt like was that although i enjoyed it very much the npc variety i found it lacking i understand that this kind of games dont have npcs as a main point in their narrative but still i would expect more from an open world game thankfully the world building change of day and night enviroment weather item descriptions and statues and the epic battles thoughout the whole game made a much bigger impact and when i finished the game i was left with a similar feeling like with the dark souls games elden ring was great but i was left wanting more of course more to do more to explore but also more to care about since the plot wasnt that interesting and i never felt engaged maybe everything being more despite we wanting that or not open world is not the the way this kind of games thrive in it felt like bilbo baggins said feels thin and stretched like butter scrapped over too much bread and the reason the bread felt still tasty was due to its many quality components an amazing game overall nonetheless and highly recommended to everyone because of its nature maybe also even more to newcomers of the genre transferred my game over a pc and doing summons for people that need help for the final boss of the main game daily eest 20 00 21 00 except wednesdays
