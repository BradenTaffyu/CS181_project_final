2023 just one more wand to carry more powerful spells just one more spell to destroy my enemies and the land they tread upon just one more perk that i may survive the baptism of chaos i will rain down upon my enemies jumping madly to avoid your own explosions because no perk can save you from a cave in or submersion in lava its over the 100 hour mark and we finally put the madness aside it is time to end this story no lasers no explosions no mushrooms no lightning no land melting and lava forming projectiles needed you approach the final boss anticipating a panic driven rush to survive the many bosses before it spawning of relentless worms who s blood you ultimately bathed in you fire your ultimate the wand a no shuffle wand with low spread handful triplicate bolts with quadcast damage boost and bloodlust kolmisilm s shield stops a scant few of the projectiles the rest make it through a handful of pixels fall from the final boss as it collapses to the floor the game ends anticlimactically a simple shotgun that s all it took with a pang of disappointment i step through the door for a time i simply sit in that final room contemplating if this really is the end i close the game i finally come back to the game knowing it was not beating the game that was fun but instead the 481 deaths from fooling around that it took me to decide i might consider trying to beat the game that was that is 36 of deaths were directly caused by myself the stendari ukko and aim botting shotgun zombies were responsible for 118 deaths another 131 by the rest of the monsters i encountered the remaining 151 deaths were due to environmental damage from collapsing ceilings converting all matter into pools of acid rooms filled with frozen vapor exploding barrels sent flying across the screen or that one last fire tick before you could submerge yourself in the water of a temple so really that s 189 deaths by me my mistakes and my greed noita a game meme d to be about being hard when it is really about how hard you make it for yourself
