2015 my history with the grand theft auto games goes all the way back to gta2 on the ps1 that game blew me away when i first played it i honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end but it never did and i kept playing it over and over again nowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen but rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the ps2 why unlike volition who make excuses as to why they couldn t provide features everyone liked rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted gta5 takes place in los santos which was previously featured in gta san andreas los santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series the game features things like industrial ghettos vast mountains with wilderness and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks it lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes gta5 looks great plays great feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly in a world of botched launches underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making gta5 goes above and beyond the call of duty it is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well what other modern game can you say the same the woods a screenshot of grand theft auto v by bluebeak
