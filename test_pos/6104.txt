2016 i found some people in the woods and i hunted them down one by one slashing their backs up with my machete i dragged their bodies through the muddy forest canvas to hang them from a hook from there i just had to wait for the spider demon to take their bodies to hell as my sacrifice when i got home dead by daylight had finally installed and i started playing this game its really good btw
