2023 i ve played all available demos of this game and in truth have about 25 30 hours in the game just recently it s a really fun party game but here are some concerns that can possibly affect you no latam or oce servers at the time of this review regular servers are having connection issues and xbox play pass users have reported issues there are microtransactions in this game however it does not affect gameplay at all as these are skins and completely optional i ll also add that you can get almost all the animals with the free to earn currency through level ups and achievements as well as some skins people are talking about an offline mode and i think there was generally some miscommunication here but i understand the complaints there is no offline only online co op and online couch co op at the time of this reviewso if these things affect you especially server concerns wait a few days for an update on stability edit update they made a statement on the steam forums about the offline stuff they are working on the ping issue for sa and oce as well apparently the servers couldn t find enough people for 8 players and shifted players in queue to other servers sa and oce players should try playing during peak times but i believe the overall issue has been solved in general
