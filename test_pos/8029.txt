2022 my last run i became a god but even gods bleed after scrabbling through dark caves i came upon a wand that unleashed a flock of explosive ducks kinda silly but fun to mess around with however soon after i found a spell that multiples projectles my heart raced as i realized ducks count as projectiles i became the duckmancer bosses that would hunt me down like an animal became my prey nothing could survive my duckstorm wand to add insult to injury a necromancy spell let me turn the carcasses of my foes into mindless meat zombies those undead allies have a tendency to pick up wands and use them a disembodied arm that was following me scooped up the duckwand i had dropped as i rifled through my inventory a surge of adrenaline coursed through veins as ducks filled my screen yet i had not summoned them i only had a moment to panic before my screen faded to black after a magnificent and terrible conflagration of birds ended me a foul ending to my pretensions of being a fowl god victim to my hubris learn from me don t fly too high to the sky and don t trust your zombies with your wands noita has a very steep learning curve but usually these types of roguelikes feel the most rewarding this is no different but its also very different the mechanics are mind boggling and the situations you will find yourself in can be infuriating yet hilarious i hate this game and only play it out of spite i hesitate to recommend this game because i m afraid of trapping others in this vicious cycle but i will anyway enter at your own risk this is my masochistic reality now
