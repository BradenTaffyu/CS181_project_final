2021 this is hands down the best call of duty the zombies experience is absolutely insane treyarch really made a timeless game with this one campaign is above par but not worth the 60 price tag multiplayer is difficult to find good games in but when you do it picks your ass up and throws you back to 2015 where we all want to be overall is such a good game i believe there would be more players if this 6 year old title didn t have the launch day pricing
