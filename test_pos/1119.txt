2022 coming up on 300 hours of play and beating the game multiple times in a market where games keep releasing unfinished or stay in alpha beta forever this game has had the best release i can remember people like to compare elden ring to darksouls 3 which is pretty accurate darksouls 3 was one of my favorite games of all time and elden ring does it quite a bit better lets start off by talking about the strengths of elden ring the massive world elden ring s world is huge maybe too big you see a mountain in the distance you can climb that mountain you climbed that mountain and now see a castle or ruins in the distance you can explore that area too the thing about ds3 after thousands of hours played the levels start to seem very small i don t think this will ever be the feeling elden ring players will encounter the map is also very detailed and enjoyable to look at and make markers for character creation 10 10 its amazing since it has so many settings to play with you can also change your appearance and name later in the game one of the best character creators i have had time to tinker with if you tried you could probably make your character look like your real life avatar the graphics and optimization er has many settings to be tweaked and seems to do a good job running on older machines some of the game does have some optimization issues but they are resolved and unnoticeable for the most part the graphics on high maximum are pretty amazing for the scale of the game might not be as good as demon souls remake quality but then again the world is massive and something had to give the art is amazing new weapons skills and tilesets of course they reuse many things from the old souls games which is actually smart considering the scale of the game if you consider all the new art they added the reuse of old material is welcomed by myself the music and sound for the game are next level i actually feel myself being unnerved by some areas music so much so i am hesitant to go back and find items in that location i play a ton of games like escape from tarkov or warzone so i know about bad sound lol the developers will put sound cues on many important items like scarabs these sounds work well for training players who want to discover secret areas to listen to less prominent noises crafting is a new mechanic to the game and is done very well the game is huge and being able to interact with the environment through harvesting definitely makes it slightly more immersive the crafting motivates players to look all around hoping to find an ingredient for cure poison or scarlet rott coupled with the ability to make detailed markers on the map you can set up some useful crafting routes ui and controls can be finicky especially if you are new to the genre i am glad they kept the same as the past titles but some other people will not like the double bound controls personally i am use to this department the multiplayer this is where er could shine quite a bit more er has decoupled summoning players and the stat boost from the effigy arc rune i think this is a good idea the game is meant to be played with others which is why they added ash summoning ash s can be very strong sometimes better than a co operator great addition but what is really disappointing is the 4 player maximum count ds3 you could get up to 7 players in your game this was great for fightclubs or just playing the game and being invaded i understand the decision to reduce to 4 maximum players was probably made because of network instability even with 4 players its unstable i know they are working hard to resolve this and have talked about it openly this is not the only problem though there is also no multiplayer pvp arenas like ds3 and ds2 this is kind of mind blowing considering how many arenas you come accross i am hoping this is resolved through dlc kinda like they did for ds2 the mutiplayer has some weird hitches people don t understand as well you can t summon a co operator with duelist in your world you can t summon a duelist if you are invaded you can summon a co operator then a duelist and then be invaded however the sequencing for who enters the world of the host is very important 2 players cannot connect to a host world at the same time this is problematic since invasions are out of the hosts control and sometimes occur at the same time as a host trying to summon a player which results in unable to summon or a disconnect once the disconnect occurs there is also a cool down before summon signs will appear again once i figured out how it works i resolved 95 of the disconnection issues balance is another controversial er topic there are a few builds which are abusing some mechanics that make pvp not so great fire s deadly sin incantation is mostly the root of these problems but some other builds using blood hound dodge can also be very frustrating to fight against i am sure fromsoftware will fix it but its still something that needs to be talked about if you are trying to duel and use a reasonable build around sl 130 you will probably be disappointed with the results i am not saying its impossible to have good fights but the chance you go against a great oak shield or eclipse shotel is high don t even get me started on moonveil katana and bloodhound step users though xd conclusionall in all the game is not far from perfect in my eyes the game just released and it was a near perfect release from my experience the balance will get ironed out so no points deducted to my score for the game in that area i do have to deduct some points for the multiplayer i am sure these issues will also be resolved or lessened when the community learns how to do the workarounds relative to other game releases for the past few years i think 9 5 is a fair score its almost perfect and soon with a patch or 2 or dlc it will be there very rarely do we get to experience a work of art like this game i do recommend trying to play without a wiki or guides but more so use them as a tool to point you in the right direction this game is so full of wonder and mystery most the enjoyment is just discovery or being awe inspired by the view of an area thats new huge and you get to explore 9 5 10 best release i can remember
