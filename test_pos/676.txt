2022 after 730 hours on the game i can honestly say that this fps game is truly a gem of the gameif you get good in this game you can perform good in most of the other fps games but it can not be the other way around the only problem of the game which we all know is the cheaters but there are also ways to not get cheaters in your match makings anyways i seriously love the game and heard valve is still improving it so good on them and of course us as players
