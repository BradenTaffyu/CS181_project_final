this game is honestly fantastic the setting is dark and gritty the combat is fluid and i ve been enjoying the player created pawns subjectively this will be my goty 2024 i do wish this game performed better there is no reason with rtx off i should be getting sub 60 fps 5800x 32gb ram 7900xtx fsr3 does nothing but ruin fidelity in this title i understand this will come with time and the game is completely playable i haven t encountered any game breaking bugs yet the only negative i have regarding gameplay is the vague quest destinations or no information at all all is solved with simple google search but i don t wanna use a 3rd source i prefer to figure it out and some of the quests don t do a great job leading the user to the objective beggar shadow iykyk i recommend buying this at a price point of 45 or less
