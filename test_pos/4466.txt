2022 when i first started playing warframe i was hesitant to continue because there were so many things to do however after watching guides and tutorials i quickly became engrossed in the game i ve now spent hundreds of hours playing it playing warframe with a buddy is even more fun as you can help each other grind for items the community is also very friendly and helpful one of my favorite things to do in the game is tridolon hunting it s incredibly satisfying to take down these powerful enemies in a short amount of time and it gives a sense of accomplishment overall warframe is an enjoyable and fulfilling game that i highly recommend
