by far one of the most amazing n best games i ve experienced and played even to this day sadly as a solo player it does get boring rather quick this game is incredibly nice and fun with the friends though for sure something i do honestly miss but overall by far best ocean mechanics in any game amazing customization ships and cosmetics for both ship and your character as well as weapons lot of stuff to do and achieve unlock work towards etc and this game only keeps improving i personally like the devs as well by far the best and one s who actually listen to their community and why this game is succeeding to this day it is not pay to win like most games and for an ue4 this game surpasses even the most ue5 ones in my opinion of course i am truly not a fan of the massive reward nerf for safer seas and pve based players though in my recent times playing i have hardly experienced any pvp players and tend to be left alone but that s just me even then not everyone is entirely toxic in my experience
