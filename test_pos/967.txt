2022 i started the journey as a lowly tarnished with only the guidance of grace to guide me on a perilous path of struggle hardship and suffering i stumbled i failed and i died i came back up again learning from my mistakes in the journey i faced many great enemies some i admired and respected while some i loathed and hated yet thankful for them all i made friends learned from teachers faced off adversaries fell in love cried in loss and shared on the happiness of each and every characters of the game for those who may call me their consort their lambkin their tarnished or even their lord i express my thanks this game was my second entry to fromsoftwares the first being sekiro and i am at a loss of words to express the emotional rollercoaster i went through during my playthroughs i now understand why their games are so well celebrated and has such a vast community it doesn t matter if i am a lowly tanished i shall never put my foolish ambitions to rest
