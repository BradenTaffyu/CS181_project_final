2016 product received for free okay i ve put this review off for a while now i think now that i have the time it s probably worth me writing one i ll try make it short sweet and straight to the point tl dr 7 10 if you re looking for a serious war game this isnt it p call of duty black ops 3 is a 50 50 game in my opinion the mixed reviews show that too it has its pros and it has its cons however something is always drawing me back to this game whether it s the frantic multiplayer or the captivating campaign but then again it s made by activision most of their games follow that path i ll start with the cons get the negativity out the way the community yeah you probably already knew about that the cod community is freaking awful that ruins it in my opinion it might not be everyone who is like that but i can assure you that at least 2 people in any match will be salty or toxic about something at some point it s hard to avoid and if you find a nice lobby stay in it of course this is only on the multiplayer part of it not so much in zombies just the game modes the system requirements this game is reliant on fps you ll probably see a tonne of reviews with these mentioned or people complaining that it doesn t run or load or work or their fps is 10 it does require a hell of a lot for it to be smooth with high fps or you can sacrifice all of the beauty in the game a very smooth look and some fps it s a shame that this game requires so much for it to be look good and be 60fps because i enjoy the surroundings in game as well as the graphics but that s a personal preference in a shooter game you need the speed you need good fps so you have an advantage over your enemies and bo3 really does rely on that in certain situations like when you re shooting down a giant spider like mech and you have to skid out the way of a missile heading straight towards you or when you re head to head against others in a death match however for some people fps will be minimum and therefore your gameplay will be very different to someone with a strong pc keep reading for a major fps fix the seriousness of it or lack of it personally i don t mind the lack of seriousness in the multiplayer and what i mean by seriousness is if you were to play some of activision s older games you d see a verrrry clear difference between this of bo3 or cod ghosts for example black ops 3 is a rather futuristic take on the bo3 franchise more so than the other 2 seriousness ceases to exist in multiplayer now that character customisation and highlight taunts have gone out the window you d know what i mean if you saw it basically if you re looking for a ominous and stealthy multiplayer where you re crawling through mud and ash to get to the objective it definitely is not this try battlefield 1 instead because i know for a fact that if you score the most by the end of the game on bf1 your character doesn t dab or do the whip naynay or does some other form of viral something bo3 is full of memes the dlcs this is straight forward just don t buy them if you want to play the new and different multiplayer maps online they are dead like in most games where they release dlc only maps no one is on them much however if you want to play this game for the zombies i d say it s worth it the dlc maps for zombies are rather enthralling and different also there s is a large amount of people playing on them the multiplayer scaling yeaap it s pretty crap i don t need to explain how bad it can be there s days where it will be perfect there is a good mix of ranks and prestiges on both sides and you have a fair fun game or there s other days where you get put on the weak team and you get absolutely slaughtered and you come out with a low 3kills 27deaths that s never fun plus you can t always avoid it by leaving the lobby and joining a new one cause there s a high chance you ll get put into a team with 3 vs 6 and the 6 are all max prestige zooming around the map and obliterating everything alright i think i covered most of what i think let s the game down a lot now onto the pros the campaign i won t spoil anything don t worry personally i really enjoyed the campaign it takes you on exciting and tiring missions you re always in your feet or in the sky doing something the seriousness that lacks in multiplayer has to be somewhere it s very immersive and emotional at times and during my play through i found myself getting attached to the different characters as well as my own you re not a backseat brain a your character that you don t see never hear but somehow they manage to save everyone and they rule the day you re play as a very proactive strong independent individual black op i found that i was drawn to them and you really take a front seat also the ability to customise yourself and your weapons is still there not to mention finding collectibles hidden within each level will be scattered and placed in your room and over time your room will become a mini museum okay okay i like the campaign and i could keep rambling on but that s not fun zombiesss i haven t actually played zombies all that much nor do i have any of the dlcs i know others who have them and really enjoy them though but from what i ve seen and experienced i can tell you it was pretty damn fun it s creepy ominous endless and noisy i ll be honest i haven t a clue how to solo it so if you re interested in zombies more than anything else i d suggest watching some gameplay or look for a review about it zombies is a mode that is fun to play with friends or alone one slip up or being in be wrong place at the wrong time could get you killed and eventually will 3 hits and you re dead meat it s very different from other cod zombie modes that and it makes it unique in many ways i also love the style of the default zombie map it s like bioshock mixed with zombies the atmosphere music and graphics i can keep this one short and sweet kinda all game modes have a nice atmosphere to them by that i mean there is a lot of detail that s been put into the maps story lines and characters it has a nice feel to it the music well i love music in games that s something i look for in games actually but that s another personal preference however all modes have their own music and it has been made to fit in to work simply it sounds great and it sets a scene indeed now onto the graphics if you read what i put above in cons you know what i m going to say the graphics are amazing then resolution is high and crisp but yeah it s a big but you can run the game in 4k and it feels like you re actually in that shoot out oooor you can run it in 1080p with acceptable fps and dream that your pc could handle 4k so i m going to tell all of you dreamers a little trick that a friend of mine told me when i was close to giving up on hope with my bad fps nightmare all you have to do to achieve rather smooth gameplay and that advantage over others in multiplayer is turn down the render resolution under video in graphics to anything under than what it s set at 60 50 etc there s a cache this makes your game look freaking awful buuuut you can play like a pro soooo i guess it s 50 50 doing this and turning down the textures will improve your fps by around 20 30 okay you know what i m going to bring this to a close i typed all this on a phone and so far it s been like 2 hours or something i can t remember anymore i stopped noticing 50 words into typing this novel yes this was short and sweet to me overall i ll recommend this game but it s more about what you re looking for in games thankyou for reading my long freaking review that i ve put off for a year i hope this helped you a bit i apologise if it didn t goodluck c
