2022 having played warhammer 1 and 2 it is true in my opinion that warhammer 3 has had a lackluster launch the races as they stand are interesting and fun to play for a while but their rosters are very limited i think this game will only get better over time with the release of both free lc such as mortal empires and dlc units if you are a fan of the series i would recommend buying this game and encouraging further development if its your first warhammer total war game i d start with warhammer 2 and hope by the time you ve finished with it warhammer 3 will have improved
