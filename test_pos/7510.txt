2023 i like it at first a bit challenging i play alone and it is a social game blocked voice and text chat from players toxicity is gone most players are there for what it is social some are friendly though i cannot hear them some are generous and fun most are cautious and defensive as they expect you to steal their stuff i found as a solo player it is a lot of fun after a lot of practice i can now avoid all players with ease scavenging and focusing on one sloop i have managed to move forward quite rapidly if you like pvp this is for you if you prefer pve then either go somewhere else or work really hard to find a niche like i did players are going to sink your ship and steal your stuff they are going to assume you will retaliate and make sure you do not come after them expect it they will hunt you without mercy yet you will find a few with better intentions i trust no one
