2022 introductionthe embodiment of gaming s self irony mocking corporate greed until you start showcasing that precise trait in real life that is how grand theft auto 5 can be summarised at least as far as i m concerned out of sheer boredom rather than explicit intention i ve decided to review a title i still hold in high regard even if it s starting to feel more and more like an excruciating guilty pleasure with each passing year of its far prolonged shelf life you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain the catalyst for this article was reading recently that gta v has sold over 170 million units in nine years since release i played it since day one on the ps3 and 2013 now seems like a far cry from current world circumstances i would lie if i claimed that i didn t have a boatload of fun within this condensed open world yet i must warn you that i shall only write about the singleplayer component which i have completed several times by this point yes covering just the part that s been an afterthought for rockstar games since their dear cash cow is still being represented by grand theft auto online if you re looking for hate or praise in regards to shark cards and the organised chaos of multiplayer gta v this isn t the right place i have no desire to indulge in it even if i may have some strong feelings for the practice itself suffice to say i ve been a gta fan for almost 25 years which means i m one of those dinosaurs that enjoyed the series before it went 3d and left its mark upon the gaming industry out of respect for those countless hours of entertainment this franchise has provided me i shall allow it the benefit of doubt in regards to its uncertain future as a singleplayer experience i truly want rockstar to prove me wrong grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n storyfrom a narrative perspective you ll either find gta v s story to be a step forward or a side step from the gritty realism of its predecessor my jury s still out yet i am certain of one thing i enjoyed the new approach encompassing multiple protagonists that was the right move in terms of finally bringing a novelty factor towards the same rags to riches pattern exhibited since gta iii not all our current anti heroes start poor and clueless this time around some are even likeable once you role play with them a bit while they still share law breaking proclivities their personalities are fairly fleshed out so they can no longer be boiled down to just thugs with ties to organised crime like in previous gta entries the 2013 renditions of los santos and blaine county are no longer linked to san fierro or las venturas like in 2004 s map of san andreas but it would be a mistake to consider the playground smaller it is in both larger and more condensed chock full of interesting locations and walking caricatures without a doubt the map is the fourth character and the one you ll interact with the most no matter how often you switch between the three official main characters hiking off the beaten path and into the wilderness should still be excercised with caution as cougars can spawn fast and they ll one shot kill more like tear you to pieces unless you spot them in time hunter becoming prey is a nice twist and this title is filled with occasions turning tropes upside down graphics the rockstar advanced game engine abbreviated as rage is state of the art and proprietary to its developer no surprise given the massive popularity of grand theft auto and the near limitless budgets which rockstar titles can enjoy while stability can t be guaranteed on launch day it s mostly smooth sailing after a patch or two by 2022 you can t expect any technical issues from gta v if you have a decent enough system adhering to the recommended specs grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n a sight to behold if you can max it out and it s making my task very easy in terms of disabling the hud at will and going crazy with the screenshots still resumed myself to a number shy of 300 images for my official showcase but i surely archived twice as many pics by the time i had reached story progress and side activities to 100 never a dull moment trust me on that the vanilla textures and assets are still passable but if the system can handle it dip your toes into some visual mods first person perspective on pc was a delight coming from the ps3 version audiogta titles have been shining through their talented voice actors since 2001 with no exception whether we re talking hollywood actors past their prime or illustrious nobodies skyrocketing to fame and online harassment sometimes it sounds convincing and amusing even in situations when these games try to act all serious no cause for complaints and that can only be highlighted by stellar choices in terms of soundtrack my love for 80s music started with gta iii and reached maturity by the time vice city was all the rage i m forever grateful to this series for shaping my tastes in music gameplaythe true heist only takes place after you ve completed all the heist missions if you play your cards right and you should as gaming the stock market is highlighting a very real concern in regards to our society today the real crooks are sharply dressed and strolling around in their ivory tower skyscrapers manipulating the stock markets and banking system for their own selfish interests what you rob during the story s heist missions will be little more than peanuts in comparison to what you ll score once you gently push the markets in your favor save lester s assassination side missions until you ve finished the rest of the story you can then find guides on how to maximize your payout by the end of it all you ll have more cash than stuff to spend it on just be patient and don t go on a shopping spree prior to manipulating the stocks it may even open your eyes on how that world and ours truly operate only thing missing after that is a career in politics dlc or any sort of additional content for gta v in fact grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n dlc plans were obviously scrapped to make way for the lucrative online modes still won t throw shade on them even if a single hour of multiplayer was enough in my case different strokes for different blokes more sp heists would have been nice you certainly don t need anyone telling you how to play a gta entry right obeying the traffic laws isn t a very high priority mission diversity is guaranteed and the cutscenes almost give the metal gear series a run for its money if only they d be just as lengthy verdictoverall i am not surprised that grand theft auto v has stood the test of time for nearly a decade the singleplayer component alone is superior to all open world competitors focusing on contemporary urban tales they don t call them gta clones without a good reason of course i ve played a lot of open world titles since it became a favorite genre of mine also thanks to gta some two decades ago much has changed even rockstar itself i won t be entirely pessimistic about what the future may hold and regardless of that make sure you enjoy gta v s story before heading to online and never looking back strong points steam achievements replay value overload excellent story characters gorgeous graphics and sounds weak points no steam trading cards this article was submitted for imperial reviews following my curator page will help me keep publishing new reviews as soon as i can thank you for your support
