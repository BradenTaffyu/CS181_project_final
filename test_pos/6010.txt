2018 in dead by daylght each game consists of 4 survivors and one killer survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening the two doors killers must chase after the survivors and sacrifice them survivors and killers are able to use perks objects in the environment add ons and offerings that help to give advantage within the game dead by daylight is also quite similar to deathgarden from the same developer it features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate kill runners with over 300 hours in the game so far i can honestly say it s one of my favorites lets start off by saying that this game isn t going to be for everyone if you re the type of person to get salty then chances are this game will make you extremely mad at some point yes any game can make someone rage but in dead by daylight the salt is real almost like league of legends maybe even more if you re a killer survivors will body block pallet loop pallet stun you flashlight blind you hold you hostage hiding and never leaving and ragequit if you re a survivor killers will lag switch face camp not moving from you while you are hooked slug or focus you most call it tunneling both sides have op perks that the other side thinks is unfair and if you main killer you ll have to face groups of friends that are all communicating in discord which puts you at a big disadvantage also i wouldnt say its neccessary but it is very recomended to have headphones whether you are the killer or a survivor you will want to hear those footstepds crows survivors breathing heartbeats etc sound will play an important role in how you play unfortunetly if you are here for a true horror game you might want to look somewhere else the initial scariness wears off pretty fast the jump scares are still there though especially with myers and amanda might not be heartstoppingly scary but if you like being startled and fancy a solid challenge this game is great 10 10 would pay full price for this game and buy all the dlcs again
