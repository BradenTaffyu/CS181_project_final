2023 i am not a dark souls player i have tried them and bounced off hard because i am just not that coordinated nor patient that said this game rapidly became one of the 5 best video games i have ever played and i ve been playing them since the 80 s if you like exploration and adventure this is the game for you and as a byproduct i ve actually gotten better at combat like actual skill i m now over 100 hours in and i ve only defeated the 1st main boss because i m having so much fun with exploring i haven t had a moment of boredom or feeling i ve played this out i m hoping it is another 100 hours because i d rather it didn t end i m hoping to stretch it out until the dlc
