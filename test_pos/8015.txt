2021 i hate this game its true i absolutely hate this game this game has the worst that roguelike roguelite rogueadjacent games have to offer you can build your arsenal on a run that you have invested a good amount of time in only for the game to flip a switch and immediately kill you its one of the most frustrating games i ve ever played in 36 years of playing videogames its also an absolutely brilliant game with incredible mechanics that is deeply satisfying on a moment to moment level kicking a box into an enemies face as he jumps at you will never stop being badass one shotting the enemy that normally screws up your runs figuring out how wands work how to read a wand s sheet quickly to determine how promising it is different types of wand styles and even unlocking nuclear options that make end up slicing enemies in half i had been waiting for this game for a long time i discovered the tech demo for the falling everything engine it was very cool to screw around with for a few minutes that feels like it was before 2010 it was always known that there was a game on the way but when it was announced it would be a witch game based on finnish folklore i became less interested magic and potions aren t really my jam still i d keep an eye out for it years after release i finally bought it and got immediately hooked 66 hours later and i ve finally finally beaten it with the help of online guides and mental health resources this game drove me crazy and i absolutely hate it but its wonderful and i also love it and you probably will too
