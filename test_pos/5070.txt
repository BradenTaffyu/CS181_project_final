2022 dont listen to the people that are complaining about the movement this game is heavily inspired by the og mw2 it s slower paced more methodical more tactical plays if you run around trying to be a movement king someone will hear your heavy ass combat boots stomping around and pre aim a corner there s no more slide canceling and bunny hops aren t as efficient as previous cod titles there are some bugs here and there and to the people regarding crashes roll back your gpu driver to a previous version fixed all my crashes and the flashing texture issues all in all this is a great cod game i ve been having a blast and yeah sbmm is still present but its also been in the past four games so its not going anywhere
