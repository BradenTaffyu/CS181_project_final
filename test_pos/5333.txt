2015 i ve got probably 300 hours in this game if you count both betas i will have many many more this is the game of the year for me competing with the witcher 3 in my personal opinion this is the only first person shooter that has been able to take my attention away from counterstrike in twelve years the potential for teamplay is amazing the mechanics are beautiful and solid the game is optimized beyond belief running at a constant 90 120 fps on my outdated crappy system there is a character for almost every type of player this is not a casual game i have absolutely no complaints cheers edit people in comments kept asking for specs so i m running amd fx 8320 with 8 gigs of ramradeon r9 280x 2048 mb gddr5 also worthy of note is that the first season pass includes nothing that isn t available to non season pass owners aside from cosmetics this is a huge compared to a lot of the season pass games we ve seen of late
