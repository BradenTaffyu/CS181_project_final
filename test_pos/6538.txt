whether or not you like a game like this depends on your personal threshold for grinding 1 drop rates and your personal suspension of disbelief of watching women with swimsuits on take several thousand bullets to the stomach i m not some young buck that gravitates towards media just because it has some tiddies on the loading screen i was brought here by all the comparisons to warframe and destiny warframe is a game i still actively play with over a thousand hours played destiny quite a bit less so i played d2 and was quickly bored by the endgame raids since i m not a hardcore player by any means my progress was quickly halted and there wasn t enough activity in the world for me to really bother with but the gameplay itself can be fun and satisfying up to a point i m not going to waste any time talking about the story it s a framework for the gameplay and much like the two games it s copying from you mostly forget what happened five minutes after it happened the intro cinematic threw a lot of names at me like the beginning of a fantasy novel the humans were defeated by the volges then the colossi came and then like what are the vulgers or whatever what are colossi is that a faction or literal it s literal that vulga boss sure looks human to me does the game explain that absolutely not i still don t know what achre is just that we have a lot of it anyway who cares moving on the game shares more dna with warframe than destiny each zone is a quasi open world but they re mostly just instanced shooting galleries with precious very little in between the missions you may run into some players that help you during these missions but half the time they run off to do their own thing which i can t fault them for they ve got their own progression to get through sometimes i just catch a high level player just going for that 20 blueprint so that s always nice to get some backup but the loop is basically warframe s relic mechanic spread across the entire loop you do missions to get some token then you either go fight a colossi or do some elite fight planetside to crack the token open very much like wf s relics the main problem here is that seems to be the entire game so far the visuals seem to be a bit overdesigned which is often a problem i run into with eastern mmo s in particular the main villain looks like someone sat down to draw a gothy suit of armor and didn t stop adding tassels or metal fixtures for six hours everything shares the same philosophy to where minute by minute visuals get drowned out by all the gunfire as i spend more time looking at my health the enemies health and my bullet counter far more than the looks of anything during cutscenes or even just finishing crafting something we re treated with some mechanical metal sound every second anytime anyone or anything does anything at all it s so excessive and actually does the opposite of the intention at the end of the day everything feels a bit homogeneous warframe also has a similar problem but it takes the three or so designs and standardizes them they have the knowledge that people aren t going to stop and look at the walls very much so you needn t waste more time adding panels or alien ridges the first descendant does not understand this distinction look i m enjoying the game for what it is right now i play a lot of fantasy and stealth games and sometimes i just want a nice gallery shooter however i can t tell you if i m going to be playing this in another six months or not i fear that this game may share the fate of other live service games or turn into the forgettable outriders where once you hit the end game you just hit a wall after sixty hours and just think well i guess i m done here tfd has the markings of this very problem but if they are vigilant with keeping up with the community updates and maybe a little buff here and there with the droprates to shed this company s previous reputation they might have a decent competitor here that or they ll just cut and run like the rest of them time will tell until then it s hard to argue with free
