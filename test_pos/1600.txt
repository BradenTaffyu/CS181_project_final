2022 total war warhammer iii was one of the most anticipated games for me in the last years with over 1500 h spent in its predecessor i knew already that this game would be a must have for me now i want to give my detailed review about the recently released last part of the trilogy build 1 0 0 i want to add that i solely focus on the campaign side of the game and not on custom battles also many points are meant as a comparision to total war warhammer ii positive prologue campaign the prologue campaign is very well made it introduces the player to the story while explaining all the necessary basics and enables complete newcomers a good start into the series unique races all of the new races not only look extremely unique but also feature their own playstyle each with its own advantages and disadvantages diplomacy inspired by total war three kingdoms the new diplomacy system is now way more comprehensible for the player and offers new possibilities like the trading of settlements finally it is possible to declare raiding and trespassing factions on your territory war while breaking existing non aggression pacts and trade agreements without receiving a diplomatic penalty military alliances you can now see on the campaign map where your military allies plan to go and thanks to the new outpost mechanic you can help your allies to defend their major settlements as well as recruit some of their units to enhance your own roster the ai is also able to use this system which causes very interesting army compositions battle maps the new battle maps are gigantic and extremely versatile land battles minor settlement battles and siege battles feel now way more epic the ai is also able to handle itself on the huge battlefields though this layout also puts a heavy focus on fast units and artillery furthermore reinforcements won t join the battle immediately instead it can be determined where they should spawn enabling more tactical planning defensive supplies and capture points the idea for the defender to construct barricades and towers with defensive supplies adds lots of variety to the battles on the other hand the attacker gets additional buffs for capturing certain points on the map to gain momentum as a compensation items and ancillaries low quality equipment can be fused or transformed into gold if not needed this helps to get rid of unwanted items and to keep the character window a bit cleaner graphics the graphics are simply stunning lots of love and effort was put into the units and the environment from the blossoming lands of grand cathay up to the surreal realms of chaos the visual aspect of the game is outstanding compared to total war warhammer 2 the overall setting is a bit more grim which fits the narrative difficulty playing on very hard very hard the campaign is challenging but not to the extent where it starts to get frustrating ogres one of the most anticipated and epic races finally made it into the game neutral the realms of chaos campaign the campaign map is nicely made it really feels like you have to race against the other factions though when entering the chaos realms you have to spend lots of ressources time and troops while gaining nothing in return in the end there should definitely be some additional benefits for defeating the 4 demon princes because you have to invest a lot to do so so currently the game punishes you for progressing the story all in all it is still a big step forward compared to the eye of the vortex campaign of total war warhammer ii optimization the optimization of the game is currently in an acceptable state the battles themselves are very smooth and load quickly but on the campaign map you will sometimes encounter fps drops when finishing starting a turn in 15 hours of gameplay i had only 1 ctd negative auto resolve auto resolve is completely unbalanced on higher difficulties especially on higher difficulties you have to fight ridiculous battles manually because otherwise it will wipe half your army it doesn t make any sense that an attack of a full stack of ogres against 10 units of kislev would result in a valiant defeat as soon as you enter the battle map itself the balance of power bar looks way like it should i can t see a reason why the ai should get buffs for auto resolve additional to the already given difficulty buffs items can be equipped immediately while most of the possibilities to cheese were removed this allows you to transfer your best items from army to army and just use them in every single battle no respec button wanted by the community for a long time the possibility to respec your lords and heroes whenever you want f e after a confederation was not introduced into the game i think ca has a reason not to do so but i am still a bit unsatisfied about this missing feature in conclusion total war warhammer iii is a great game and the first hours were a blast for me but i have to state again that i was also a big fan of the other two parts of the trilogy currently i would rate the game with a 85 90 100 with a reasonable auto resolve an enhanced optimization and the introduction of the mortal empires campaign it will easily be a perfect game in my eyes edit after playing the game a bit longer seeing some of the patches as well as the road map i have to admit that my original rating of 85 90 100 was way too enthusiastic the developers had lots of time and ressources as well as experience thanks to tw w1 and tw w2 yet they delivered the game in a questionable state and the replayability of the current campaign is not so high so until immortal empires launches i would rather give this game a 65 70 100 rating edit 2 with the current version 2 1 2 of immortal empires i can revert to my original rating of 85 100 while still being a bit unbalanced and the ai lacking bite compared to tw w2 the game is really enjoyable and better optimized compared to a few months before also the simultaneous turns feature works very well in multiplayer
