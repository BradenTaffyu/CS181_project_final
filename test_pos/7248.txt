for better and for worse dragon s dogma 2 is a faithful sequel to its predecessor it has taken after seemingly everything the first game did lay out good and bad may it be design decisions or corporate not giving it enough room to breathe it s a refined somewhat streamlined maybe even simplified version of the first game s combat system making for a different experience but a more accessible one you ll turn out a game plan for all the vocations you pick up pretty quickly and there s basically no overlap between what all the vocations are capable meant to do the loop is by my definition pretty fun may it be dispatching the game s abundance of goblin or saurian chaff or tackling the larger members of the game s bestiary unfortunately their placement across the game world is mismanaged and it may lead to a nagging feeling of repetitiveness in the later parts of a playthrough the pawns they are great both stupid and smart capable of triumphant success and bitter failure they will be the source of both your highest and lowest moments in the game in equal measure they will comment about every little thing and attempt numerous times to guide you to your next destination or a chest they happened to find while exploring other worlds beyond the rift i would like to dedicate this review to the pawn adam sandler if his creator ever reads this godspeed the story is as anecdotal as it once was it is a mishmash of unexplored ideas unfinished story beats and hollow characters that will inevitably lead to a feeling of disappointment as for many players the credits will roll and i suspect they ll be thinking that s it the pacing is poorly handled with the later half of the game feeling like a summary of events rather than a well told middle and end to the game s narrative with a high probability that players will miss out on a very meaningful chunk of the game visually the characters and enemies are modeled and animated beautifully the landscapes are gorgeous and traversing the world is a genuinely pleasing experience weapon swings will feel light or weighty as they require and the feedback from connecting weapons skills or finishers is very satisfying the game s sound design and music are also phenomenal i will miss dark arisen s main menu theme but aside from that the music accompanying you during either exploration or combat are very well composed and the sound effects punctuating fights also add to the previously mentioned feedback further enhancing combat as a whole from a technical standpoint the game bears many faults performance and stability issues have been mentioned numerous times rightfully i personally have only struggled with dropping frame rates in particularly dense environments and while i ve only ever crashed once in 141 hours of playtime i ve slipped under geometry a couple times a very harrowing experience i am not too sensible to performance issues but it may heavily hinder your enjoyment of the game it definitely deserved more time to simmer and i hope we will eventually get a more stable and better performing version later not too late into its lifespan so as to allow for a greater amount of people to play the game the micro transactions topic has been done and done none of the content being sold to you is exclusive to the digital storefront it is all obtainable in game with minimal effort you are paying to go fast not paying to play or to win that being said i would like to highlight i do not condone the addition of the redundant micro transactions they only brought bad pr for nothing i would like to believe it is a clause they need to be added per the executive decision of some corporate goon and it was decided to pick the lesser of all possible evils in the game they are not intrusive in the slightest and not once would it come to my mind to quit out of the game to purchase any of the items sold but they already tarnished the game in many people s eyes pointlessly in conclusion unfortunately and like many many games dragon s dogma 2 is not perfect in the current sorry state of the industry it has come out as on par with its peers hastily released and very much owed at least another 6 months in the competent hands of developers unspoiled by greed in spite of that it is really really fun tarred as the frame rates may sometimes be the joy it brings me to sink a sword of dragon slaying proportions into the nearest living creature or toppling a great beast many many times my size is simply too great my god please give us a slider for the fov i am begging on my knees
