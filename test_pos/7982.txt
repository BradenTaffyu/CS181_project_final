2021 the reasons why people love and hate this game are exactly the same the game won t offer you a goal guide or quest but it will offer you countless hours of exploring and experimenting with whatever you want if you start playing with the mindset of this being your usual roguelike or rougelite you ll probably come out frustrated the game never boxes you in in fact it wants you to use its own mechanics against it every wall is crossable every enemy is defeatable the game feels difficult because an unbreakable material or a boss with a million health feels like a roadblock you re not meant to cross but in noita you are meant to do it the game s seemingly ridiculous difficulty stems from how non conventional the combat is you might not be able to take that eldritch monster straight on but you can turn it into a sheep and teleport it into lava or you can dig a tunnel and just never have to deal with it on a slightly different note as a completionist this game has felt incredibly satisfying to play i m the type of person who checks every bookshelf in a game just to read there are some books here fifty times so i wasn t expecting anything big when i tried to go out of bounds let me tell you there are no bounds every time i tried to throw the game a curveball it threw one right back at me in conclision noita is best played if you enjoy learning the game s mechanics through trial and error the game is more rewarding than it seems and it encourages creative problem solving it won t be easy but every accomplishment will be yours
