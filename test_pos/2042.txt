2022 this game has a really nice learning curve you actually get rewarded for the time you put in and see the fruits of your labor i love the aestethic of the game and the different filter options it has so you can customize the looks fitting to your liking should you have a strong enough pc the combat is simple but complex enough for every taste and every mechanic has counterplay there was never a time i felt like i couldnt do anything about anything its always i could have dodged then go for a light attack etc i like games like these really much and i enjoy it some people say there are bots or it is a dead game which is not the case at all i really recommend you trying it out there are pvp modes battle royalarenapve and everything is connected to reward systems that you can either buy for money or just grind there is a gamepass for it which is really good value but i myself never bought anything for money except the core game for like 30 bucks i have nice aestethic freedom due to the customizer tool for skin facecial features etc the team really puts in effort to make the game balanced and i think it is so far i ve played like 10 games in gold of which i ve won the past 6 as 1 rank and i gotta say it feels so rewarding once you understand the system to a detail for example now there is a ashen katana that is only available through grinding quests and it actually rewards you for putting in the time to my knowledge not even buyable throug money so it gives you the sense of prestige if you want it i love this game highly recommend even tho there are frustrating learning moments not gonna lie
