2023 this game is totally amazing i bought a desktop computer in february of 2023 to play this game and i was disappointed the first time i played it i redownloaded it in november 2023 and did a few things differently 1 i played with more than one person 2 i did more than just quests like grind forts 3 i made it far enough to purchase my own ship 4 i got hooked on hourglass like most games this game has a steep learning curve once you make a few friends and learn a few things from youtube and change your keybinds then this game starts to come alive in a way that really no other game has before i am not sure if it s partially because i am ex navy or if it is something else about it but i love this game it will be my main grind for a while and i am always looking for people to play with my discord is wagen3886 you should add me and tell me you want to play some sea of thieves i am cool with you being completely new but would appreciate being told that is the case if you like high stakes games with intense communication and cooperation then you will love sea of thieves it s included on game pass but it s well worth the money
