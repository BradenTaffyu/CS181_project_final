2016 1 started playing this game excited 2 join a lobby get in game spawn next to the killer and i got hooked and camped 3 happens a couple more times 4 another trapper he hooks me after he finds me fixing the 3rd gen and places a trap underneath me 5 i attempt to escape don t do this in game unless there is no hope and somehow magically get off 6 i run as fast as i can but to no avail 7 he steps in his own trap as he carries me and i run at this point my heart is racing 8 i manage to repair the rest of the gens injuried 9 escaped well besides all the campers this game can potentially be quite fun i sure had a good time this game is a really good source of adrenaline and is pretty fun to play with friends although it is still great to play in solo
