the dlc everyone is complaining about you can earn in game such as the book to customize your character you actually can get into character creation again to customize yourself or your pawn again once you are at the first big city following the main story pretty early you head to the market place there is like a huge rift stone inside an open building next to it is a pawn at a small table selling a book for 500 rift points which you can earn in game and a lot of the other dlc comes with the pre order bonus and literally says this item will be acquired later in game i m enjoying this game so far it s funedit i ve now dunked 60 hours into the game and can say i love it theirs so much to do and see and the vocations are amazing i also love the fact that you can just see other peoples pawns roaming around the map so you have a chance to see a goofy encounter there s also hair dyes in the game that let you further customize your character you can get them whenever but the journey is a bit of a drag but still fun because you get to explore the map transportation in this game is especially easier to do late game the oxcarts seem to be placed around enough where there easy to access and i have a good abundance of ferrystones and i m yet to buy any
