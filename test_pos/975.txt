2022 yeah pretty good some advice for newer players and veterans alike upgrades to weapons matter more than the stats they scale on get your quality of life stats to a reasonable number vigor to 30 at least preferably higher abuse the new guard counter mechanic if you re playing a more melee focused character with either a shield or a two handed weapon the jump attack mechanic is more powerful than ever before and does additional poise damage use it don t get overly attached to your runes deaths will happen so don t let yourself get all worked up because you lost a bunch remember to breathe and take breaks magic can be extremely powerful i m sure everyone has seen the get op in 10 minutes clickbait nonsense videos what those don t account for is player experience and skill while you can follow those guides to get a good lead the game isn t going to roll over for you get comfy with the idea of losing to a boss a few times so you can figure out its moveset and openings sorcery players the amount of intelligence to equip certain spells and gear is outrageous in elden ring don t let an equip requirement of 70 int distract you from your qol stats get your vigor and mind up your qol stats will carry you harder than that fancy new spell or staff i promise and don t be afraid to upgrade weapons you don t necessarily love weapon upgrade stones are plentiful and you can purchase more of them from npcs once you find the items to unlock them in shops just beat ng 2 and got all achievements happy to answer any questions
