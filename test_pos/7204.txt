being almost 70 years old normally i cannot play games like this as my manual dexterity just is not on par however having ai control my partner and my two hirelings allows me to form a well rounded party and when tough fights come they make up for any slack from me i have over 240 hours in this game and have loved every minute of it i wish there were more games like this for those of us with physical imitations this game is completely playable as long as you have a sharp mind more than a sharp sword cudos to capcom other than thaty i will spend about 10 seconds on saying what every one else has the graphics are stunning the gameplay is smooth the storyline is enticing for me a 11 10
