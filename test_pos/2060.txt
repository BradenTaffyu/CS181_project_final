2021 edit this is after the update which came well sometimes now the game runs well now the new character valda cui is an interesting addition but needs a bit of a balancing about balancing it still need a bit more polishing but slowly getting there it s really enjoyable now naraka bladepoint is an online battle royale game where warriors around the world go to morus isle to fight for the mask of immortality for their own goal i waited a bit to write this review to experience more from the game i also got experience from the beta so this review will hopefully be a complete overview about this game it s hard for me to choose what i like most in this game but probably my favorite is the sound design the game has epic and traditional sounding like soundtrack but what takes the cake is the sound effects in general because you can determine it easily where the sound coming from even if someone shooting from behind of a building or someone running on the roof above you you will definitely notice it most online games lack of this quality sound design the character s voice are pretty good too my personal favorite the authentic chinese dub about the controls it seems a bit confusing at first however you can get into it quickly the combat system also simple you can do horizontal and vertical strikes with the left right click you can charge these attack types and also you can do a counter if you press both attack types at the same type movement is similar to other games but the game also indicates the usable buttons on the screen surprisingly the game got really good graphics the whole world is vibrating because of the different colors and places which looks really good effects are also nice looking just like the models too however because of this awesome graphics you will need at least a 4gb graphics card instead of 2gb sadly this is also a problem with the game because if you lack of proper components to play the game the game will lag a lot when it s load in the game also it s recommended to put the game on ssd to reduce load time believe me it will be better for you because sadly if the game not loaded in properly you won t be able to interact properly in the world it s always a nice touch when the devs making backstories for the life and death game and for the characters too you can find more lore about the characters which are interesting and give depth for the game and also it s pretty surprising to see such thing in a multiplayer only game time to talk about the gameplay i don t want to write a long describing about what you do in the game but i try to mention the corner stones of the gameplay so there are 60 players on an island which has varied environment and loots you can play 7 different characters right now they got 2 skills per character and every skill has 2 other variants too you can find melee and ranged weapons in the game every range weapon has it s own mechanic and stats you can find bows muskets or even a flamethrower for example i briefly mentioned the melee combat system but you can do different attacks in different movement state and of course you can use different weapons like longswords spears or great swords for example and also these weapons got their own combo system and stats too you can find additional items in the world but also you can collect coins and buy items from the shops on the island which will help you throughout your journey i want to mention the jades which can give you passive or even active skills either for weapons or for your character moonbane charms can make danger zones basically you ask the help of a snake god which will make the area of your choice to purge the game also has other dangers or helps in the world for example you can eat fruits to buff yourself temporarily or find dandelions to make your footsteps silenced the mentioned dangerous are could be fire lamps which if it falls on you you will get stunned and you start burning which takes your hp but there are wheels in dried up rivers which if you make move you can take out players with and a lot other you can find and explore need to mention the findable quest scrolls in the game which if you complete in the game you earn coins these all alone makes the gameplay really interesting but i need to mention the movement in the game which makes your character go parkour you can do jumps flips and combining with the findable and buyable grappling hooks you can do really fun movements and strategies needless to say the game has a lot to offer in the matches however outside of the island you can experience the detailed character face customization the tons of skins in the game leaderboards throughout the game either you play in solo or trio the custom game option and also the ffa game mode bloodbath but also the unranked br game mode too but there is also a talent system in the game which gives you certain passive buffs for your character in each match also naraka bladepoint not the regular long ranged battle royale game because ranged weapons are not that damage heavy the game focuses on the melee weapons you need to go face to face with others and defeat them in there if you want to achieve victory which is really changing up the usual battle royale receipt long story short the game has tons of really good things and usually battle royale games are not interesting for me but naraka bladepoint got me good with it s tons of details however things are not that always good probably the biggest issue with this game it s skill heavy there are lot of players who play insanely well in the game in every division making every match difficult even top 5 finishes too if you want to play casually you might have a bad time until you don t learn how to better in the game the developers tried to make this a bit easier at the beginning when the player got introduced with bots in regular matches lot of people had their hopes up when they won a match easily until the next game where they got destroyed by real players so if you are interested in the game you need to step up in your game because you might just rage quit from naraka because you don t understand why you got stun locked in a fight why you can t win games the game s movement also lacking sometimes not grabbing edges when it should or at few parts your character get stuck in places the game also unoptimized too these are basically the biggest issues with the game another interesting thing in the game is that sometimes you end up playing someone else from the other side of the world or even you are not on eu server the devs say that they try to minimize the lags in this case but most of the time it s really noticeable and unfair before i verdict this review i want to mention two more things first the loot boxes and dlcs i don t understand why you hate the game which has these stuffs because if you buy a dlc or loot box you only get cosmetics the game is not pay to win so you can just simply avoid these things lot other games do the same and there is just a few which let you freely choose between cosmetics for free so i don t really get what s the matter with it if you still get annoyed by this it will be the best for everyone for you to not play this game the other thing the mentioned bots you can say it s a marketing step to not let the player let go early from the game but it s an understandable move in general naraka bladepoint is a really detailed and fun battle royale game and also competitive lot of people will give up on it because it s difficult but i recommend you to check videos about the game and tutorials to learn the game i can definietly recommend you to play the game even for the full price because this is by far my favorite battle royale game i have ever played
