noita is a game about one thing knowledge despite having lots of randomized aspects the game is very consistent in the way that it behaves every enemy acts in the same way wand building is purely logical even if sometimes it doesn t feel that way and the same key structures and regions will always exist when i was first playing through the game nearly none of my deaths felt frustrating or worthless because every death helped me understand how the game works it manages to strike a fine balance between being deeply complicated and being approachable and learnable as you accumulate knowledge about how this game works you will naturally achieve better and better runs until victory knowledge is the true meta progression of noita and it more than makes up for the lack of proper meta progression that it has relative to other roguelites and with your knowledge you can go beyond victory soon enough you learn how to completely break this game apart discovering the utility of each simple spell that makes almost all of them valuable under the right circumstances it s very very satisfying to take seemingly total control of the game after spending nearly a hundred hours trying to beat it just a single time new secrets become feasible and it s exciting to unravel them and learn how the game clues you into its puzzles every symbol has a meaning however the running message behind this game s narrative is that you are never completely in control which is reflected by the game itself no matter how strong you get it s very easy to get too reckless and lose everything by being transformed into a sheep or misunderstanding a certain mechanic you always have to stay somewhat alert even after becoming presumably unkillable there is also some really nice pixel art here as well certain environments and prebuilt structures are especially cool it s a great game
