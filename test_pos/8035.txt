2021 first and foremost let s make one thing clear this is a game which creates polarizing opinions you ll either love it unconditionally or hate it completely and there s a simple reason to that know yourself and you ll know whether you ll enjoy the game if you play games to win you will not enjoy the game as with most roguelites but especially so with this one the game is as unfair as they come in a way roguelites are always difficult but most usually you don t have the option to kill yourself with your own weapon and in this game it s one of the biggest causes of mortality does that mean the weapon system is bad no much to the contrary the marketing campaign of the game was that every pixel is simulated and while that s true and impressive i find that the game is as good as it is because of the weapon system weapons are fully customizable and completely broken if you know your way around the wandcrafting in the world you ll find wands which have certain stats and spells the roster of spells is almost excessive so there is a myriad to not say an infinite amount of possible spell combinations which must synergize with the wand too remember that it s a roguelite and suddenly you see that while you have many different options you have to improvise most of the time but that s not bad through improvisation you might find combinations you would never imagine were so powerful but you might accidentally kill yourself in the process the weapon system is not the only thing that is immense finding your way to the final boss of the game is a tough endeavour and often feels like a very long journey you start at the surface and you make your way down across seven biomes before meeting the boss it s long but it s the shortest most basic route you can take what if instead of going down the mines you climb the giant tree you ll find left of your spawn and see what s west or jump to the top of the mountain which gives access to the cave and see what s east want to get more advanced what s up you can go anywhere and if you don t mind the spoilers search for a map on google the seven basic biomes let s call them like that are very small compared to the entire world there s a million things i could say about the game but most you should find yourself whether it be on youtube or after a thousand tries or so the amount of content in this game is ludicrous and the challenges it offers are inhuman it s a very versatile and dynamic game but keep in mind that it s ridiculosly unkind even the rocks want to kill you not for the faint of heart but definitely for those who want a balanced game that s completely broken
