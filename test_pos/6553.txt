i have 97 3 hours in the beta i was one of if not the player with the highest mr in the game at 23 i know this game it is fantastic if you want strats or a guide i ll leave the basics at the bottom edit i m 11 hours in now 29 hours just past devo he dropped a lot faster than in the beta currently i m worried about the challenge of the game it picks up alot just after devo pyro was a big bottle neck i am seeing zones with just me in it for hours now i m assuming it hits around lvl 100 since that s what hard mode looks to target let s all dive into this without worrying about how we compare to others the fastest players might sprint through everything but the grind will slow them down enough that a mildly jogging player will catch up quickly expect a grind btw i grinded for 20 hours for a single mod in the beta drop rates get rather nuts one mod dropped for something like 1000 total players from the data i found on it it was a 1 10000 drop chance on a mob that spawned in about 1 in 20 packs no player actively farming got it it was an accidental drop with all of that said bunny and range plus power is the fastest farmer gley was broken in the beta she will be broken again if you get her in time you will have her long enough to clear the entire set of bosses and farm for your chosen bossing set i have only completed the dead bride set in the beta it was something like 1 5k extra hp which is very worth it i know pyro also had a set but i never completed it primes or ultimates are good you want them but the farm was around 20 hours per ulti probably more now i assume you will see players getting their first farmed set on day 3 to 4 those will be the top players in the game so don t expect to keep up unless you have 70 ish hours by then i m rewriting my guns portion guns are ruled by the legionaries at launch my thunder cage is already hitting in the 50 to 55k range at around lvl 50 gun wise so seriously look into keeping them up to date when you hit milestone levels for an everyday player this would be closer to the hard mode section than the campaign re roll for crit dmg chance and damage try and get the yellow stats mods section is being reworked range and damage are the name of the game for the campaign i wouldn t worry about anything else until hard mode these two will help you clear large packs and 1 to 5 tap mini bosses or challenge enemies skills do all to raids in the early game but ramp up like crazy do not waste your crystal cats or the extra 20 mod slot thingos i forgot their names lol they are both about double what i remember them costing in the beta so a 20 to 30 hour farm watch reddit for the best mods players will find them much faster than youtubers will upvote good builds help everyone see what works if their is a market its good for the players if its broken early you can make money late game for now we want everyone prepped to farm their hearts out my final notes gley is a boss killer but jayber was op as for bossing in the beta he solos everything bunny is ass at bossing most other characters were not optimal for every boss but they can work if you let them breath dont steal the bosses attention from your tanks and if you cant kill a boss stop fighting it and farm hard and fast seriously 3 or 4 tries should be enough to see if you dont dps it hard enough if you are out dpsed then move on tl dr watch reddit for mod drops guns will be wild don t trust this is the best gun in the game videos don t waste your forma when bossing don t waste time losing to it just go farm high level mods end of tl dr forgive my grammar grammarly is yelling at me for something like 30 missed commas but i don t care to clean this all up i hope my info helps you could very well see my builds on the reddit i have a whole week off and some money for the game happy grinding fellas
