a pirates life to havea beautiful game with plenty of stuff to do sadly it requires having friends because most encounters with players end in pvp instead of friendship another down side is the requirement of a x box live account but as long as you have played minecraft in the last year or two you should most likely have one being forced onto you already i forgot to mention that the game desperately needs a decent tutorial for pvp or ship maintenance you only get told how to patch a single hole and how to raise the mast but by the time you actually encounter players and get shot up to a point where you survive but have to repair you already forgot how to do it game doesnt tell you to aim for different areas on the ship either for more damage you wont sink a ship by hitting the same spot 50 times i would recommend getting it on sale for 20 bucks not the full price imo
