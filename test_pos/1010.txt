possibly the best game i ve ever played to date going into the game as my first fromsoft and soulsborne game i didn t really have any high expectations of what was to come with most games i play i usually play for 3 4 hours in one session and call it quits for the day but with elden ring i m spending upwards to 10 hours a day playing it it s just that good while yes i do have over 80 hours played at the time of writing this review i m still not entirely finished with the game i m currently at the endgame of the base game and still have tons to explore and do not to mention the dlc i have started a few hours ago now for the game itself yes it s good the art direction voice acting and lore are unlike any other i ve seen before sure the graphics don t look too realistic either but the great art direction and style make up for it giving it a rich world surrounded by some colorful and great looking regions in the world itself if this is your first fromsoft or soulsborne game like it was mine don t go into it expecting it to be easy from the get go it was hard general enemy types used to kill me left and right at the start of the game but with enough patience and progressing through the story i ve managed to overcome even the strongest of foes the game had to offer should you buy it absolutely
