2022 campaign 8 10 let s give it up to iw for making one of the most memorable campaigns in a long time for the call of duty games putting old classic memorable moments into the gameeven with dialogues to make the player feel like they still got you it s a big step up from 2019 s campaign characters feel more solid and tell their own stories setting up the plot for the next game very nicely mission variety 7 10 there is not much to explore but there are missions you do complete stealth and some you run and gun and be technical about your stuff at times of course you can do both but the veteran mode does not take kindly for running and gunning in stealth based missions i d say it s challenging than impossible even though we feel some missions inspired by the past there are certain places i feel that iw could have added a few missions or 2 that can be very unique to this game other than showcasing amsterdam graphics 9 10 the game doesn t feature any of the fancy raytracing implementation but does its job very well wow at the amsterdam mission alone in mexico it features almost everything we know about 2019 s mw and improves upon it on mw2 i will drop 1 point from this review just it would be nice to have raytracing in campaign mode at least to give the taste of realistic reflections on the gun scope ground surfaces and shadows it doesn t mean that game is doing a bad job at any of these it maximizes its all efforts on making the game more realistic to feel and look in every point you take sound design 10 10 in a surround system environment or stereo environment this game does absolute best to have peek your ear senses from where a bullet is coming or from where an enemy is approaching you absolute best if you are camping somewhere and you wanna listen to someone s coming up to you you can do it with sound and of course campaign bgms and sound effects not cutting any corners absolutely modern warfare we know and love guns mechanics 7 10 i love what it does with the guns and mechanics there s no super hero ing like what you do with 2019mw i may not have played a couple of hundred hours in 2019 s mw fairly around 20h and i get the idea but you can be pretty much a superhero sliding and shooting slide cancelling and stuff that is not a thing now you can t just go on running and gunning this time around like i specified in missions veteran mode mp doesn t take kindly to people who do running and gunning this time around for the majority of the maps there are certain maps in mp that you can do fast paced example the embassy map can be an example but most of the maps are focused to do tactical shooting perspective listen think and know where you are is the key to the win a game people who loved the fast running and gunning will feel this is absolute nonsense i m no pro if thats how the game is then adopting is what we have to do most of the time game hey change your gameplan this time around maybe multiplayer 7 10 following the comment from above as i feel like most of the maps are not fast pased its just feels like the maps are done mainly domination mode hardpoint games in mind mostly not tdm most of the maps don t give you enough spot to camp the camping areas are very much visible and to be honest a camper can t be staying in one position the entire time of the game that said i ve been playing the game for straight 40h timed as i m typing the review some maps feels more rewarding than you just go on running and killing whatever on your way with a powerful shotgun or with a sniper rilfe camped up somewhere overall i m glued to the game as much as i like to point out its goodness there are bad parts of its own since there are no slide cancelling and so on super hero ing in the game certain maps feels very useless to play with you get trashed if you are doing a different loadout or daily challenge that said santa sena border crossing map both fun and irritating at the same time you literally cant camp in certain games and you can camp entire game in certain games basically tdm you run around everywhere dominition specially taking when enemy captured is nearly impossible if there s a good camper defending the place and of course running in between the cars you get blown up with traps or whatever even by a aim noob shooting at the cars so ye there are those downsides as well overall it s pretty enjoyable i find the game fun and at times frustrating well it s a game after all overall 8 10 great for both campaign and multiplayer its fun chaotic and memorable campaign with a nostalgia around the corner there s a lot room for improvement more maps
