2022 if you re on the fence give it a try i don t play many roguelikes and i don t play terraria but i thoroughly enjoyed this game after almost 100 hours of slowly improving my skills i finally got to the ending i don t beat many games these days but this one was well worth the effort i still haven t seen all that there is to see in this game though so i imagine i ll spend many more hours with noita
