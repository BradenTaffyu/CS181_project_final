2021 even 8 years later this game is easily one of the best that you can buy whilst gta online has gone in a direction i don t like and wouldn t really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage i can t ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities there s something for everyone in gta online and it will also make them money whilst they re at it single player is also undeniably a brilliant experience even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story there s really no excuse for not playing it through at least once a lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it s original release but from an objective point of view even if this game released for the very first time this year it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away the driving is much easier than gta 4 literally anyone can be a decent driver in gta 5 unless you have brain damage but i guess it makes it more accessible lol shooting is also much improved and is high quality and those two elements combined with many others including but not limited to the excellent map make this game a perfect sandbox my only concern is there s too much cheater in online mode and they are so really annoying i hope rockstar improves there anti cheat program if there s one so the players can really enjoy what gta online can offer
