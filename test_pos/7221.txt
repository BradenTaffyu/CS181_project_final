it was definitely possible if not outright likely this sequel would not be dragon s dogma the game design could have died a death by a thousand antithetical cuts at the hands of suits and contemporary standards but for better or worse here s dragon s dogma 2 they didn t mess with it you will jump and climb on giant monsters and stab them in the eye while stuffing potatoes into your face you will hear your pawn remark about the same ladder in vernworth more times than you ve heard hello in your lifetime the story is anemic and arbitrary forgetting its own beats the characters are plentiful but cardboard there are two saves you will lose pawns to terrain despite your best micromanaging your pawn will pick up all your worst combat habits and embarrass you in front of strangers online progression scaling is lackluster you will feel hopelessly desperate at the beginning only to wake up one level and feel like god fast travel is artificially limited but similarly scaled where suddenly you are awash in ferrystones big mob hunting is made more tedious by the large map and minotaurs are the griffins of this title it feels like quests are still easy to bungle due to time progress or simply missing them and most importantly all of this is gift wrapped in the meta of the dragon s literal dogma so of course everything i just mentioned is thematically deliberate and why there s no 2 in the main menu title frankly it was everything i wanted and once again my complaint is give me more but that s obviously not my only complaint i actually didn t have many crashes in 100 hours but the game still runs like molten molasses framerates are mostly fine in the wilderness but low in cities which is mildly problematic later on normally this would be least concern easiest fixed but the fact the game shipped like this that they thought even the poor performance on the ps5 was acceptable hints that maybe that s not the case beaucoup hardware won t save you here something is fundamentally wrong and it s currently setting your cpu on fire while the frames hitch if you like dragon s dogma warts and all and circumstances have prevented you from buying it at release try it anyway i found it playable on my potato rig once i acclimated to the framerate dips if you think you could like dragon s dogma play dark arisen instead as the price point for curiosity is lower 5 bucks on sale usually and it won t melt your rig if you didn t like dragon s dogma 1 this isn t going to change your mind and you d just be engaging the definition of insanity
