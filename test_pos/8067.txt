2020 noita is a wonderful game implementing lots of different spells magic alchemy and things for you to explore and figure out to your heart s content there s workshop and despite my hours i ve yet to find everything in the base game so far even in its current state it offers plenty to do by means of exploration and experimentation it s quite literally a magic sandbox from casting magic missiles to nuclear eggs the progression is incredibly satisfying but there are still shortcomings while i adore and do love the game i do think that it lacks actual purpose to why you should interact with the simulated particles sure i can set wood on fire create concrete concoct and combine liquids kick boxes and pour freezing liquids over enemies but there s ironically not much incentive to in the beginning you aren t given much in the way of actually doing this either but rather than spending 5 minutes setting up a trap or somehow breaking a part of the ceiling to kill an enemy i might as well use the same spells to kill them it feels like a novelty even if a welcome one and a much likelier way for you to die the first stage level in the cave is the worst of this narrow passages that offer nothing in the means of creatively killing an enemy good luck finding more than four ways to kill an enemy when you could just as easily shoot a spell at them and kill them under five seconds similarly it lacks actual incentive to properly explore there s purpose in general exploration but proper cave diving exploration feels purposeless i can spend upwards from 10 to 30 minutes on the first stage alone if i want to pick up all of the maximum health increases but for all i know none might spawn at all and i ve just wasted 30 minutes for nothing i have no way of telling if there are more health pickups chests wands potions or secrets on the first stage nor do i know if there s more i should be looking around for elsewhere personally i find this is a big problem given that you don t really need to do all of this either hell just skip everything and always go deeper until you find the portal you end up beating the primary final boss in less than 10 minutes sure that s definitely not where the game ends and there s a lot left to explore however by removing the redundancies of guessing whether or not i should explore more find more wands pick up more health accumulate more gold you effectively cut out most of the exploration and reason to bother with any of the levels stages maybe being my last problem i think the game is completely unfair in some parts dying to crushing yourself under a roof is fine suffocating in all of the water you summoned is fine nuking yourself is fine and so is summoning an army of companions that turn on you those are things you need to learn the mechanics of and can develop skill in not making the same mistake you can not get better at being polymorphed though you can not get better at being stun locked and you sure as hell can t get better at not being one shot i ve had countless amounts of deaths caused by my own mistakes but there are plenty more where things killed me which were completely out of my control i have been punted like a golf ball between enemies kept elevated and completely unable to move until i died a good ten seconds of being able to do nothing as a two hour long run is thrown in the bin i ve been polymorphed with my 900 health reduced to 10 by a fungal wizard bleeding and was easily one shot by any enemy in the vicinity with such little movement speed i may as well be serving my head on a silver platter i ve been blown up by some random enemy outside of my screen picking up a wand with a nuke on it i ve been killed by a ghost the one that is immune to all damage except the two lights spell in the whole game that phased into the safe room from the temple level i ve been killed by the witch ghost spawning on the first stage with 400 health and kicking me to death i ve been killed by the lightning ghost in the tower that stun locked me every time i tried running away or used any kind of spell the list goes on but you get the point it s that which makes me actually regret having spent multiple hours on a single run to have it reduced to nothing by something i couldn t use skill to avoid or improve at i write this review and still recommend it even having just come back from a 5 hour long run in which i was polymorphed and killed in under a second by a fungal wizard again to address some things i do realise this is a roguelike roguelite game however that doesn t mean that it s particularly fun to lose runs to things outside of your control in a game that doesn t use rpg esque mechanics i d expect to die from missing a single hit 30 times because of my low stats in something like tome or dcss but not an action roguelike roguelite such as noita where your aim is determined by skill and so is movement or your ability to dodge when it comes to the perks that give you a radar more like a sensor for treasure and wands those are also completely random and are null in the beginning since you start out with no perks suggested improvements to things like this is to for one add more ways to avoid being one shot or polymorphed if i m given opportunity to grab a polymorph resistance perk or a potion that grants immunity to potion effects suddenly that becomes much more focused on exploration prepping and not dying to something out of my control maybe instead of being juggled like a volleyball or being punted like a golf ball to my untimely death give me possibility to avoid this using an item or a skill somehow additionally why not provide incentive to using simulated particles by allowing them to do things like this why don t i have a spell that can create a temporary wall to block shots redirect fluids or cleanse me of debuffs i think inspiration can very easily be taken from magicka and how it handled resistances despite its rock paper scissors formula it makes sense to not be polymorphed when you re already set on fire or maybe you aren t knocked around when you re doused in sticky slime a liquid that has no purpose in its current state other than to provide inconvenience maybe it can give you electric immunity or physical resistance if it s like rubber to quickly add to this why does poison poison me when i ve not ingested it toxic sludge makes sense poison doesn t maybe it should be a liquid that increases damage from all sources instead but it s whatever in a game about magic despite all of this i do still recommend the game yes really it s lots of fun but i d warn you to expect a lot of frustration when it comes to things out of your control if you feel attached to runs like that channel your inner nihilism and realise that your resistance and perseverance against death is futile and i m sure you ll enjoy this much more than i did after losing my 5 hour long run
