2017 this review is about singleplay only i m not a multiplayer guy and were it up to me i d separated gta v solo and gta online completely but anyway that s not an issue and i m just talking of the single player game rockstar finally released on the pc despite their ugly maximize profits policy and i really think that gta v is hugely overrated a little spoiler up ahead it s not even a spoiler technically at the end of the game michael says i m too old for this and that s i think the words of sam hauser you see technically gta v kicks asses alright it is still the best gta like game on the market you have cars bikes boats jets a helluva lot of activities and stuff to make your play a unique one an unforgettable experience but it fails in the most major aspect for what so many people loved vice city and san andreas titles the attractiveness of the story the compassion thing i ve blamed the gta iv for it and it s the same and somehow even worse with the gta v just like the mafia 2 3 where the main characters are so boring and unpleasant people i d kill them myself were it an option the case of gta v is worse than gta iv and a lot worse than san andreas by the originality option as well let s take trevor for instance for he s obviously the most noticeable guy of the whole trio he s all kinds of a bad dude sure but i ve played the game with just the same character a decade ago it was the scarface and even the special the rage mode was the same for tony montana as it is for trevor scarface game was quite a mediocre one somewhere on the level of true crime maybe and by the time of san andreas it would be a joke to copy something into rockstar game what was done in some wannabe competitors title today it s a major issue now gta v is still a quite good gta like game it s still making shots and all but it s just one in a row it s not an overmighty king it was once oh i m sure that 10 years old who now plays and streams gta online like mad are not gonna agree with me and some middle to old aged creeps like sam hauser itself would point me at the more realistic world around that was made in gta iv and v i know i know i m myself a middle aged creep who likes realistic stuff much more than some phantasy elves and ponies but there is still a compassion thing a mood after playing san andreas or saints row 2 is better in my case than the mood from gta 4 5 or saints row 3 4 those late games provide less than pretends and sometimes even hollowing your emotions rather than provide you with some new and strong ones so let s come to the mark thing i ll give gta v a 7 5 10 for the amount of work they made minus point is for hollowing unlikely characters minus point for an overall creepy atmosphere gta v providing even the radio was worse than usual oh mate that s a disaster
