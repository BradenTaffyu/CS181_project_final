2016 warframe is a pve coop with some pvp end game that has a striking resemblance to borderlands even down to the music i don t know which came first but too many similarities to think that they were developed completely independently the most notable difference is that warframe has a series of very large maps and is not open world in warframe you have a home base your spaceship you mount expeditions to the various maps selecting appropriate gear for the mission in hand the basic idea behind warframe is that you have a battle suit called a warframe that comes with various skills you can own many different warframes and weapons with which you can undertake missions to gather materials designs and points to work your way up to the best equipment and skills the crafting is central to warframe and is excellent you can buy all the gear but it s much better to craft it all it s easy to understand and very well designed indeed most importantly there isn t the slightest sign of rng anywhere in the craftng thank heaven sure drops are rng but you would expect that levelling up has been very well designed you the player levels but all your gear levels up too each individual item has a level literally everything can be upgraded and tweaked even mods can be upgraded when you get new gear that has to be levelled up but the game has been designed in such a way that it s not as difficult as it may sound to level up a new gun for example if you take along a level 1 item to a higher level conflict it will level up fast the really clever part of warframe is that the gear you make never goes obsolete gear comes in a myriad of different or flavours different skills of it s own if you like and that s what drives you to collect more but once you have some gear it isn t actually essential to get more you just upgrade and mod it until it s as good as it can be then it remains with you for life so to speak sure there is some gear that is better towards the end game but if you really want to stick to your favourite gun then you can the really important part of warframs is building up a solid collection of mods for your gear the mods are transferable and can change a basic weapon in to a super powerd end game weapon most of your time will be spent trying to get good mods and upgrading them in to great mods you carry a primary gun secondary gun and a melee weapon melee figures highly in the game but you can choose your own path if you want to ignore melee you can if you want to go full ninja using swords and so on you can it s up to you although there are different formats for the missions if you think of a combination of borderlands and l4d then you won t go too far wrong there are slower missions that you can solo and pace but the moment you enter a party then it s going to be really fast comparing it to borderlands the balance of the game is far better you always feel that you are challenged but you always feel that your weapons are doing what they should do the social aspect of the game is weak actually very similar to borderlands as yet i haven t seen any elitism which is refreshing people just form parties and get on with it without moaning that player isn t performing or whatever teamplay tends to be very poor but that s actually very typical for a coop the average young lad is more interested in rambo ing a level rather than doing what he should be doing acting as part of a team so many players are primarily built for dps and speed warframes take a unique perspective on gender given their context within the storyline you are a tenno an ancient warrior and you own and use a series of warframes that have different abilities and features oddly warframes are gender locked so as you choose different warframes for different missions so your gender will alternate how strange is that of course you can just stick to one warframe if you prefer but that s really not the point of the game the main quests in the game are good but the in game explanations are very poor you often find yourself completely baffled as to what s going on you will need to reference youtube for many of the quests just in an attempt to understand what you are supposed to be doing missions small quests are much simpler and really don t need any explanation at all you just see them light up on the starchart when you should run them and you click and go there s also a constant supply of alert missions that give bonus rewards all in all there is a lot to do the only one real criticism i have found is that in two solo quests it locks you in the quest until you have won you can not leave you can not bypass you have to win or it s literally game over you can t get out by dying there is no stuck key restart your pc and you will be back in the quest with no way out you can t get help from friends you can t progress the game at all until you win to my mind that is utter insanity so many players will have reached one of those points and just thrown in the towel there isn t really much warning either you could well have a useless warframe on when you reach the point and it s really game over seems strange on an mmo that you want to get rid of customers really total nonsense thank heaven there are only two points like that the only thing i can say is if ever it says that you are about to have restricted access to the rest of the game immediately check youtube to find out what you are in for get your best gear on and just hope because it may be the end of the game for you party games operate exactly the same as borderlands there is no server as such rather the person who starts the party hosts the party this means that generally pings are very good but can vary depending how far you are from the host and what type of connection they have in general though the gameplay is not particularly ping dependant the gameplay is not structured so that you require tanks and healers and so on although they do exist the developers could do with making players depend on the team more to lessen the rambo behaviour in the game the game is free but of course it constantly and i really mean constantly tempts you to spend real money the game is definitely not p2w or p2p but it most certainly is more fun if you spend a little most items can be crafted but of course some of the exclusive skins will cost you money there are three currencies in the game credits earnt by playing platinum bought for cash and finally cash the advantage of platinum is that it can be traded between players so some exclusive items can be obtained by trading however cash can not be traded so if you want the really exclusive skins then there is little option but to part with hard earned cash although players can trade there is no in game player market the only market in the game is for players to buy items from the game which are sold at fixed cash prices platinum tradeable currency in the game and credits you earn playing taxation can also be very high on traded items ultimately the downfall the reason you may stop playing the game is the lack of variation in missions and the lack of true coop play if you like speed play and are part of a static you could keep going forever on this game but otherwise you are likely to get bored sooner or later don t think for an instant that it s not worth playing though it most certainly is i ve been on the lookout for a borderlands type mmo for a very long time shame i didn t know there was one already out there stop wasting time download it it s an amazing game
