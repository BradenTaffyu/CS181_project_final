once human by wholf once human is a game i ve dedicated around 200 hours to playing every single day and experiencing a range of emotions from fun and laughter to excitement in my opinion this game is definitely a contender for game of the year though it does need some fixes the game offers an open world survival experience filled with monsters elite bosses dungeons silos easter eggs puzzles and many other features there are bizarre creatures a compelling storyline which could use some updates stunning graphics smooth gameplay and a robust base building system though it could use more features and clipping fixes unfortunately the servers worlds in once human feel empty and inactive despite there being hundreds of bases only a few are in use with a maximum of 400 players per world i rarely encounter other players except during world events this issue needs addressing soon as finding an active warband or hive is currently challenging for example i ve been looking for an active warband on my server but no one seems to engage in world chat or participate in warband activities which is disappointing luckily a fix is coming in august so let s hope for the best the same issue applies to playing with friends some of my friends can t join my server because it s full even though it feels empty this problem is also expected to be resolved in august however another issue arises with new players joining level 50 players while we could share items and boost them it s not ideal i can t wait to play with my whole group but i don t want to start over again some players complain about two files and claim the game is pay2win first the two files are harmless and all information about them is available online second the game is not pay2win you can only buy cosmetics and the battle pass once you reach level 50 obtain the best gear and weapons complete all villages cities areas side quests and main quests and build a powerful character the game feels complete personally i ve finished everything significant maybe missing a few puzzles now i m making youtube tutorials exploring finding easter eggs and reworking my base i have high hopes for more content in the future and can t wait to see what s next the game offers a lot a vast world with plenty of activities challenges world events areas to clear puzzles easter eggs a compelling storyline base building unique items and extensive weapon and gear customization the music and sound effects are also exceptionally well done especially the main menu music which reminds me of the good old call of duty days however the game might be too easy a level 20 player can fight level 30 40 enemies with the right loadouts leveling up is also straightforward if you focus on exploring and doing quests rather than just dungeons it depends on your playstyle really the development team is very active and communicative providing information answering questions handling tickets and more they are passionate and i m happy to work with them unlike many companies with big games this team handles things well and i wish them all the best additionally if you re on a pvp server and in a pvp zone sometimes objects and buildings don t render properly over long distances this can create the illusion that you can hit an enemy when they are actually hidden behind a rock or inside a house i ve encountered this multiple times and it s quite frustrating hopefully this issue will be fixed soon another point to consider in pvp is that if you re getting wrecked by an opponent it might be because they re using a powerful build like the shrapnel build which deals a lot of damage keep that in mind to summarize here are the top 5 positives and negatives positives 1 the vast array of features once human offers 2 the base building and crafting system 3 the detailed loadout system with blueprints and modifications 4 a large world with plenty to explore discover and solve 5 the game s impressive graphics and immersive environment negatives 1 the server system where friends can t join and servers feel empty 2 the game being a bit too easy 3 overpowered builds if done correctly 4 a clunky building system with alignment and clipping issues 5 occasional crashes even on a perfectly capable pc overall once human is a highly enjoyable game it s free to play packed with features boasts great graphics and is easy to progress in despite minor bugs well developed systems and the need for updates once human feels like a blend of palworld fallout 76 and rust i m giving it a 9 2 10 so far great job and i can t wait to see its
