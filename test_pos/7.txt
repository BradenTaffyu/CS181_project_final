at the time of my review i ve done everything there is to do in pve i ve gotten every class to 25 unlocked every perk leveled every weapon to relic tier unlocked every mastery point for each weapon unlocked every heraldry unlocked every cosmetic through operations 35 successful missions per class and beat every operation on ruthless also beat the campaign which i enjoyed the moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense parry and perfect dodge are great additions all of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore at least for me for those wondering about campaign length it s approximately 7 hours give or take and if you are on harder difficulties you may find that to be longer when you combine that with the operations that tie into the story that buffs it up to the 10 12 hour range doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty current max and soloing them all was a really fun challenge but it s not required edit i ve now played a ton of pvp still ranking up and i m having a blast at max veterancy level 25 i ve played 100s of matches the pvp is quite good but it suffers from map variety the balance is actually quite good and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced overall great game i didn t run into any major issues all of the classes are fun and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that i had submitted have already been addressed i ll report back with my findings re hours played i was in both the preview and review periods of the game which was about a month or so which is why i have a considerable amount of hours not all of the hours were 100 playtime of course things like setting up scenarios for videos capturing footage editing but i would say i probably have at least 300 hours of playtime in the game edit 12900k 3090ti decent machine plays well performance was solid
