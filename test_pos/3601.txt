2015 many people usually ask if gta v is worth it well if your pc is decent and you know for sure that your pc can handle this game then it s definetely worth it i started single player thought that this is great then i tried online before even getting 3rd character in sp and i don t want to go back to single player game anymore i can t comment about pros and cons but i personally think this game is worth the money to play online
