i liked playing online in invite only finished story on ps4 also bought it on steam to play with friends the addition of a anti cheat is good but out of all things they chose battleye the worst anti cheat out there just look at escape from tarkov if you don t believe me also i wish the devs activated the battleye for linux steam deck though the game is in top 10 played game in steam deck and they just them over linux is even supported by battleye like they just need to tick a box i cannot play it anymore since im on linux it wasn t a good run and it ended
