2023 wow i simply cannot do this game any justice by attempting to write a review on how incredible this game is but i will try my best elden ring is an enormous game with so much for the player to discover even now 200 hours in i myself am still finding new hidden areas and secret bosses quests i ve missed in other playthroughs as someone who is completely new to souls games i was slightly nervous coming into elden ring after hearing the difficulty of certain bosses and areas however being an open world game and allowing the user to go to different areas level up or just come back later gives any new player a fair chance and doesn t make certain encounters unbearable like other games from the souls genre personally i find the graphics lore characters storyline all to be 10 10 elden ring doesn t just feel like a game it s a story where you a maidenless tarnished rise up the ranks slaying gods legends and shardbearers to become an elden lord but will you go for a happy ending maybe you like destruction and chaos and want to see the world burn elden ring lets you decide the fate of the lands between i d highly recommend this game to any souls fan as it s proclaimed as the best in the genre ever any open world game fan as there s so much to explore whether it s dungeons caves forests mountains or any gamer who likes a challenge want to test yourself against some of the hardest bosses in gaming try malenia on for size in conclusion this game stands alongside skyrim as my favourite game i ve ever played and it truly is an 11 10
