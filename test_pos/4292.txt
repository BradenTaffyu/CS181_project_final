2013 introwarframe is a fast paced third person shooter the developer digital extremes is the studio behind the darkness 2 and dark sector digital extremes gets involved with the community by providing regular patches video updates and participation in the forums digital extremes borrows heavily from their previous game dark sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making warframe summary great atmosphere environments great weapon skills character selection great clan system dojo is impressive great developer support updates are good chunks and come often great movement opportunities running across wall is fun grind blueprints materials gameplay the gameplay is pretty solid if you are looking something flashy like devil may cry you are not going to get it here that being said the variation of weapons really make up for this the warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design each one has stats and abilities that set them apart which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point a to point b rank systemrank system emphasis on developing experience with warframes weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal since rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship mobility and combat abilities this system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas customizationupgrading transmuting and fusion are several methods to improve your options the level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods this allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages to fight certain factions or missions the forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further atmospherethe setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game the atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments the new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks updatesas someone who made a long guide for this game i can say that their updates are so solid i feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant this is most apparent in their ui changes they have made which made my videos a bit weird to see for the newer players clanthe dojo is one of the nicest additions i have seen yet not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it the dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research pay to win if you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured that s not how it is the only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots you can put time in and get the same results you just can t have many warframes weapons at once they also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas for example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process so instead of buying the weapon you can collect the resources craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don t have to wait grinding yes there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay off aka the warframe as soon as possible the grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints this is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability so if you do not mind grinding buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough conclusionoverall warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a pay to win game if you are looking for an interesting game just give it a try i am sure it won t disappoint
