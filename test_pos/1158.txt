2022 elden ring is undoubtedly a generation defining game it turns the open world meta on its head removing the pointless filler quests and npcs that make you get things for them that they really should be getting for themselves exploration is encouraged and rewarded you aren t held to a linear path and if you git gud you can take on end game bosses while hugely underleveled the world is beautiful it might not have the best graphics but the art direction is incredible i ve often found myself on a cliff edge just looking out at the view seeing how far i ve travelled and how far i ve still got to go combat is challenging but once you ve learned an enemies move set and figure out how to beat it there s a real sense of achievement you can beat any boss with any build so you can play the game how you want if you don t want to take the time to learn a move set then a cheese is usually available enemies are numerous and varied and you won t get bored fighting the same enemy over and over again even where enemies are copy paste jobs they generally have an additional attack that you weren t expecting as you progress in the game which adds to the flavour a common criticism is that the game has no story but it does it just isn t given to you you need to go looking for the story and complete side quests to understand the implications of your actions and how the characters fit together there s also a lot of visual storytelling in the game and taking in the world around you helps to understand what s happening in any particular area there are a couple of negatives it could do with a few quality of life improvements e g a more liberal use of map markers and slightly better menu navigation and sorting options there are also some small balancing issues later in the game and one particular boss with a specific move that relies a little too much on rng to get past these issues don t take away from what elden ring is it s a masterpiece and you should play it
