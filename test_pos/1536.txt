2023 the replayability on this game is astounding and its really fun to play with friends now buying all the requisite base games is costly and all the skaven related dlc unless you are getting it on a steam sale but that s nothing new earlier this year ca released a dlc called forge of the chaos dwarves an all new race with neat new mechanics and units consisting of 3 legendary lords it was well received by basically all and launched with minimal or next to 0 issues it is by far one of my fav factions to play personally it cost 25 now ca s executives and board are releasing a lord pack shadows of change and it simply doesn t stack up based on the value proposition that they themselves have established with the chaos dwarves dlc shadows is the same price but includes no new races and no revolution in mechanics and very few new units apparently the kislev lord is also bugged to the point of unplayability i m not getting shadows of change because it doesn t live up to the value proposition that ca itself established earlier this year total war is ca s biggest property but instead of training their strengths by giving tw warhammer the time and attention the game needs the executives and board are clearly plowing total war profits into their derivative fort valerant clone and inevitable failure of a game called hyenas pathetic ca executives and board members are clearly a bunch of out of touch hacks who know nothing of business do they not know that chasing after other audiences to the detriment of your core products has not worked for any entertainment company from modern cinema writ large to netflix to disney are they paying attention do they think they are better positioned then multi billion dollar entertainment companies who have failed at the same gamble games workshop needs to revisit this partnership and read the ca board the riot act or else risk the poisoning of a massive on ramp to gw s own ip so i come back to what i said in the first line of this review the replayability of this game is amazing therefore i don t need this new crap dlc to make and to keep this game fun for me and my friends so i won t be buying anything from ca at least until their garbage secondary product hyenas launches and subsequently fails
