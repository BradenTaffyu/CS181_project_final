2021 naraka is a great fast paced battle royal which provides a fresh take on the genre and the high skill ceiling of a fighting game pros melee combat feels fantastic there is so much potential with dash cancels fakes parries and a lot more tech if you are willing to learn and invest time into it movement is so much fun you can grapple around like spiderman slide around or just run character choice the game has many characters and more in the future for different playstyles each character gets a single core ability and an ultimate however with each ability ultimate you get three choices that can drastically change how it works for more customization c character customization you have so many options to customize your character it s too much power from cosmetics appearance glyphs rune system like league and skills you can play solo or with friends up to a party of 3 there is also rank play there is also more game modes coming in the future cons the game is sometimes very clunky for example it can be hard to jump out of a window and instead get stuck climbing a wall when in a building the game is not entirely balanced some characters feel a lot stronger than others the high skill ceiling it can be very daunting for noob players like me and off putting for others but improvement comes with time i would recommend having an ssd otherwise it s unplayable overall i m enjoying the game and would recommend you give it a try i truly believe this game has potential
