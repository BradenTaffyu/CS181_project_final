2017 warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing but i can honestly say the majority of it was great let me start by describing what warframe is its an over the shoulder third person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space the solar system is in chaos and it s up to you to maintain the balance with many weapon types to choose from and different frames to use to suit your playstyle the possibilities are endless however there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work it s pretty much an mmo at this point so certain classes of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions the developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features for example the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle it was introduced as operation ambulas reborn which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies there were a few bugs at first but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24 48 hours all in all this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living breathing world that is constantly changing i have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features such as certain weapons cosmetic packs etc other than that if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it everything important is attainable without paying money for it i do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like but only at your own discretion speaking of which there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency platinum where you can spend platinum to buy parts weapon mods and other hard to obtain aspects from other players as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum the prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things all in all i have had a great experience with this game rather than reading my long winded review about the game why not try it yourself it s free also feel free to add me ingame and i will do my best to be as helpful as possible my name is mix masterson see you on the battlefield and have fun
