2022 this is not a game to be played by anyone that can t handle the frustration of repeated occasionally nonsensical and always brutal deaths you can be 10 hours into a run which is a pretty insane achievement in itself feel like you re invincible and a single second of inattention or lapse of concentration is all it takes to send you splattering back to square one that being said noita has easily become one of my favourite games of all time on the surface it s a relatively simple game with cool as hell physics and a super fun interesting system of spell and wand building magic that can provide hours of entertainment on its own the aim is to progress downwards through a series of biomes in a manner familiar to most gamers clearing and exploring each area until you reach the end and complete your run this in itself can easily take tens or hundreds of attempts and will feel like a monumental victory the first time you succeed without spoiling too much though this game is deep far deeper and far more expansive than you can possibly imagine upon first playing exploration experimentation careful consideration of everything you witness and pushing the limits of thinking outside of the box are all rewarded richly usually with a swift death and a valuable piece of additional knowledge about this intriguing world if you were to play this blind without ever looking information up online you could spend literally thousands of hours without discovering all that this masterpiece has to offer i don t want to give away anything more but if you enjoy games that are extremely challenging to the point of easily being frustrating endlessly replayable and accept you will likely never truly complete it without mods and outside info then in my opinion noita is the greatest time money value you could possibly ever get from any single player game i ve seen a lot of what s written here may seem like hyperbole and the difficulty opacity of progression will certainly put many people off there are mods that can help you with that but 15 20 30 years from now this is the game that will be stuck in my memory as a truly special experience as well as quite possibly still having me coming back to explore and attempt to fully truly complete
