2020 i recommend dead by daylight to people who don t rage easily or get overly competitive it s a very repetitive game and the only thing that changes is others play style during the game the developers are making changes to keep the game fun and even balanced for the crybabies i sometimes get annoyed with chainsaw killers or people who camp a hook when you are playing survivor but that s not the games fault it s the player who is playing killer so yeah sometimes people suck in the game but i feel like i ve had lot more fun than i ve had not fun i think it s a great game to play with friends or just play alone and meet new people in the community trying to escape death or trying to murder people i enjoy both i m also chill so maybe that s why i like the game so much
