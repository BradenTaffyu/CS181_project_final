2020 sea of thieves is one of the most polished games i have experienced in recent memory its environment immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play explore and experience the campaign stories called tall tales are intriguing inventive and curious to play through when it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns it feels a bit lackluster and basic battling enemies head on lacks challenge and is relatively simple that said the boat battles against skeleton ships ghost ships kraken megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique the amount of ways to mess around with your opponent blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time moments where you t bone an enemy ship grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that i have yet to see matched in other games to add depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4 you will be provided larger ships from a single said sloop to a massive galleon all with their own benefits and short comings making battles incredibly challenging another key part of the game is the progression in the game for some players the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing however if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards this may be the game for you in sea of thieves what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks access to better weaponry ships or other in the game the quests currencies and rewards are all related to cosmetics to improve the look and feel of yourself and your ship to end if gta is the open world grindfest to unlocking cooler cars upgrades and real estate then sea of thieves is its counterpart where everything is already unlocked and you simply sail for the great times and moments with your shipmates
