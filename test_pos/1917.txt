update 8 16 24 the new loot crate pretty much undoes everything good i say below about how the iaps are not predatory the new system is incredibly badly translated at least and intentionally misleading at worst to get all of the top rewards you would need to hit 05 5 times or spend 435 dollars that is the actual number not an exaggeration yes it is just cosmetic and yes you don t have to do it but this is pretty much exactly what i didn t what to see in the game i shouldn t be surprised because its not new in other regions but still tldr a free to play online third person crafting survival looter shooter that actually isn t pay to win doesn t constantly pressure you to buy things like speed ups or unlocks has pve and pvp servers and doesn t even have a cash gatcha option yes please and thank you once human oh is a great example of how devs could choose to do iap and gatcha without seeming like a predatory cash monger that really only is hunting for whales slightly more detail iap including the battle pass is cosmetic only the gatcha machine which is one of several ways you can get new equipment blueprints or power up your existing gear blueprint fragments can only be used with currency earned by playing the game oh is an interesting mix of the division any survival game with resource nodes and the secret world it s got a lot of gathering exploring looting shooting and crafting speaking of crafting you ll be making everything from food gear and ammo to houses vehicles and gun turrets oh has a sort of a modern lovecraftian ruined earth mysterious setting that works reasonably well and overall the game is more then the sum of its parts there s gotta be a catch right well yeah kinda two things first the game is far from perfect the gun play the setting the base building and overall game play loop are very good its fun and there s a lot of quick and fast rewards for everything on the con side of things the vo is spotty some of the writing misses the mark entirely the overall story line for season 1 at least is a bit weak and there can be performance issues on certain pcs which is made often much worse in groups of players doing a large event however my only one real gripe is that the puzzles are just not good one thing that secret world did right is that it had real adventure game style puzzles in an mmorpg that actually fit the setting super well and worked well and were fun by comparison the puzzles in oh are with a tiny few exceptions not really puzzles and not really any good they are rewarding in the sense that you get a good reward for completing them but not in the sense that you feel like you solved something second there are planned seasonal wipes every six weeks there s a lot of info out there but i m going to try to summarize very quickly and probably do a really bad job at the start of a new season you go back to level 1 and start fresh except you retain blueprints fragments found formulas furniture crafting unlocked weapon accessories and pretty much all event or seasonal currencies i personally think this doesn t sound so bad as the things you are losing are actually very easy to get back very quickly and the things you are keeping are exactly what actually matter that said until we see it season reset actually happen we kinda don t know it could be horrible but it could actually be okay or even good it might be worth it if each season is actually distinct and there s new and interesting things to do shoot loot craft and win from the gatcha final note overall i ve had a lot of fun with the game so far and i ve enjoyed leveling up my favorite part of any game and watching my character get strong and stronger kill some elder god level things and build a pretty awesome base you d think i d be sad to lose all that at the end of the season still a ways off and sure being max level and min maxing your build is fun but its the getting there that i like and i think it might be fun to do it all over again maybe as a completely different build with a completely different looking base disclaimer i have spent 9 99 on the battle pass because i really liked some of the cosmetics in this specific pass but i honestly think if i look at the next one and don t see several things i like i d be just fine not getting the next pass p s i dunno this review kinda went off the rails from where it started and what is usually a freewriting exercise that i just do in one go and then lightly edit turned into a sprawling mess that i re ordered like way too many times so if something seems horribly out of place or super poorly edited that s why thanks
