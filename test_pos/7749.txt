2022 i had 220 hours in sea of thieves with the xbox game pass before buying it outright on steam i think it s great for what it is season 5 brought a lot of small but generally positive improvements to the game which i appreciated more than the disney rollercoaster in that it is on rails which was a pirate s life storage crates save so much time that i now buy one at the start of every session fireworks are great the new commendations are quite fun and i like that the burying treasure mechanic gives you a new way to play the game hiding loot instead of selling it at an outpost the new shanties are pretty good too pros very pretty a fun time with friends commendations can give you little goals for your session which seems to be a more satisfying way of playing then just going after booty once you ve been playing a while you have access to such a range of cosmetics for your pirate and your ship currency is kind of meaningless so you never really lose anything from sinking apart from your time of course cons solo slooping is fine until you run into sweatlords getting sunk by a crew of 2 4 players when you re on your own feels pretty bad pvp quite often consists of another crew dropping your capstan and then chain killing you or attacking you while you are away from your ship selling loot there seem to be fewer friendly interactions with other crews recently than before at the core of it the game is mostly fetch quests you have to make your own fun to enjoy it tips for dealing with sweatlordstm if they don t have voice chat don t trust them don t let other crews on board your ship unless you are sure they are friendly gunpowder is probably more likely to sink you than anyone else so in summary i recommend it play it with friends don t be a sweatlordtm practice your broadsides drink grog use your speaking trumpet blunderbusses are lame chunky bois 4 life
