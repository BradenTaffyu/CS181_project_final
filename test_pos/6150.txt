2016 okay so the game is about a killer who has to try and kill 4 survivors or the other way around the game is about 4 survivors who have to survive form the killer what i like the graphics look really good the feeling that you get chased by the killer is awesome the gui looks awesome the game is competitivewhat i dislike the game might be hard for beginners if the killer is camping the spot where he hangs you then you are as good as unable to help out your teammates currently no option for public parties guess this will be added soon there is no way to communicate with your team unless you re in the lobby killer won t get a bonus for survivors disconnected i find this highly annoying due to the fact that i constantly have to cope with it if the killer abandons you will not get anything but might even lose stuff fixed
