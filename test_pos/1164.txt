2022 elden ring isn t perfect comparing this game to other fromsoftware products one aspect after another it s clear that elden ring isn t as smooth as sekiro doesn t have bosses like dark souls and its story isn t as good as bloodborne but looking this way at anything will make no sense you simply do not order salad in subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad elden rings lore and story game s still fresh vaatividya still works on lore and so far we barely can piece together coherent explanation to what happened before we set foot in lands between it offers some similarities to ideas that dark souls used before and it s open for speculations as much as for the story of the game we re thrown in fractured world only hundred years after the shattering war that no demigod came out victorious leaving lands between in stalemate we re tarnished once stripped from the grace of greater will and exiled coming back to lands between resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from with one goal to become the elden lord world of elden ring to summarize how big lands between are i will say only this there s always more elden ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level this already sounds like enormous place but wait there s more each part has legacy dungeons big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place there are also catacombs minor erdtrees ruins villages and so on it is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through still not enough there is literally 3 major underground locations each bigger than the last one and for the dessert whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of lands between it is big but is it pleasant to look at to answer that we can go back and look at last two games made by fromsoftware sekiro and dark souls 3 and precisely fountainhead palace and irithyll of the boreal valley fromsoftware seems to like dragging players through countless swamps and catacombs difficult bosses and whatnot to build up the hatred towards another location that we might need to go through to finish the game and then every negative emotion leaves the body because we re presented with what s called the best area in the game aesthetically that s the case with irithyll that s the case with fountainhead palace and that s the case with nearly every legacy dungeon in elden ring progressing through the world of this game is like going the best location in one souls game to another best location from different game i think there also is beauty in elevation and elden ring does exceptional job at that too lands between are not flat they re constantly changing elevation as we progress through the game but not only between main parts of the map also between locations in those parts fromsoftware creates dark fantasy and i personally think that currently there s no one in the industry better at doing so gameplay of elden ring the most important part for some especially if advertised as action rpg just a reminder you re tarnished a nobody with a simple task to become the elden lord against various demigods with a stick and wooden shield the game is not easy it is not the hardest fromsoftware game but it s still hard especially for newcomers what to expect dying a lot elden ring like any from game has no difficulty slider there s one difficulty get gud fortunately for tarnished elden ring provides a lot of different mechanics to ease the pain such as magic summons broken status buildup bleed cold co op cheesing and last but not least for pc modding there already are mods to change the difficulty by lowering health and attack damage of nearly everything in elden ring to experience the game the best way though is to go through it yourself learn to fight optimize your build and try again because there s no better feeling in fromsoftware games than beating hard boss yourself will you get bored i don t think there s a chance to get bored in this game even with such simple combat mechanics because there s also variety of builds with easily over 200 probably even more weapons over 100 armor sets for your fresh elden bling and many more configurations with new addition ashes of war if that s not enough let s talk about variety of enemies remember seeing total of 19 enemies in god of war from 2018 winner of game of the year there s over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other except for reskins not many of them though also rats are back now with madness status to make your life even more miserable there s actually a lot of enemies that you will hate with passion you will go on reddit and vent about it and you will see that vast majority of players also hate them i am malenia blade of ashina and hasitation is defeat tldr the game is the only rightful choice for game of the year
