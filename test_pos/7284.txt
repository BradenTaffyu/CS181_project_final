i ve been enjoying the game so far i have played the first game it s more of what i loved about the original the microtransactions well i don t want to see these in any game but looking at what is in dragon s dogma 2 it s actually really minor and these things can be obtained in game easily i think don t give it a pass just because of the complaints about these otherwise you d be missing out on an excellent game just don t buy the items because really the game doesn t require you to in order to progress i play a lot of mmos and believe me the mtx in this game is so insignificant it can be ignored performance issues i have a very fast pc so didn t have a problem with framerates but it definitely can use more optimization i believe these optimization issues can be fixed and it should improve the performance for others having more issues running their games overall my recommendation is to buy and enjoy the game just like the first game this second installment promises many hours of awesome rpg fun
