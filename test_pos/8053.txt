best to talk about the most important pain point first this game is absurdly hard if you are prone to anger when gaming i would honestly advise not to play noita i m not talking about a soulslike level of difficulty here but of something that approaches closely but never crosses the border of being unplayable there are a lot of ways to die in noita and most of them will hint at errors you made when playing finishing a several hours long run on this note is a very humbling experience and it s definitely something you want to be aware of before starting the game as you re likely to live that a lot completing your first run will probably take tens of hours careful reflection a lot of learning about the game s mechanics and a good amount of luck that said noita is absurdly good the simulation aspect of the game honestly feels impossible to compare to anything else every pixel of the game is simulated and various elements potions materials some enemies as well interact with each other folliwing alchemical principles the spell casting wand making system is impressive it takes a lot of time to understand how to properly use it and what you are doing exactly but its combination possibilities feel endless once you do due to the very high difficulty level each lesson you understand on the way the game functions the procedural generation the effect of the different potions and the best ways to use them the strenghts and weaknesses of the perks and the sequence breaks you can do with various elements among other topics feels incredibly rewarding noita is one of the best games i ever played if you feel you might enjoy this kind of gameplay experience then don t hesitate to give it a try it s not made for everyone but it s an absolute gem
