2023 give mw3 its own launcher you cheap people open mw2 click play mw3 campaign close game open another launcher just give us the launcher option for the campaign its so frustrating i would feel better about buying it if it wasnt tagging along on mw2 s launcher this just makes it feel like you paid 70 or 100 for a dlc get it together fix the launchers and the game menu s because they are awful mw3 campaign so far is solid though with the exception of it only being 5 to 6 hours long the credits seem longer then the campaign im not recommending because of price lack of content but if you like cod and want to spend the money for the campaign even though it cost to much the campaign is good just short
