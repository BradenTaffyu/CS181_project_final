if you re overly competitive get genuinely angry or upset when you lose i don t recommend dbd it doesn t know whether or not it wants to be a casual or ranked competitive game and you will want to do questionable things when you inevitably die or not get a single kill it will happen and there s nothing you can do to change that the game has its faults but ultimately i enjoy it don t take it too seriously on either killer or survivor side i d say get it on sale if you can as 30 for something you re not 100 sure you ll enjoy might be a dealbreaker for some the main gripe i have with the game isn t the game itself it s the community i don t think i ve ever witnessed a playerbase hate literally everything killer mains hate survivors survivor mains hate killers both hate the devs nothing is ever balanced perfectly and positive changes are too little too late to matter apparently if you re easily swayed and tend to mirror the emotions of the spaces you re in consider not doing that or at least not engaging with those kinds of people and you will have a much better time lose is in quotes because there isn t a real win or loss condition just things that are encouraged by the game eg you a survivor dying is technically a loss but if you help the rest of your team out and all 3 of them escape that s a win to me and a good source of bloodpoints
