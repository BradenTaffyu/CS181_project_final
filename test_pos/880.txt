2022 i bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that soulslike is for me even though i could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries he s not wrong that the game seems perfect for me a character customization heavy arpg that actually makes the player work to play better not farm harder with mysterious lore gritty aesthetic and rogue like punishment yet time and time again as much as i want to be enamored by the game i find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving and default to things that are more forgiving i am weak but when i walked out of the gates and saw the lands in between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor i immediately identified multiple places i wanted to explore and i felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it of course the first thing i investigated reassured me that many things could in fact stop me from doing it that s actually what i realized i needed from other soulslikes i don t mind a linear path but i don t like feeling trapped in the same mistake when i m playing elden ring if i can t figure something out i don t feel like my entire experience is blocked i can walk away and go check out something nearby maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me i m always progressing even if i walk away that option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre what kept me was all the stuff i d hoped to get out of the other games the characters are vague but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder i actually feel like i m a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war i didn t feel important at the start but i slowly started to say wait you think i m not tough after i took down redacted i actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and i worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose and it was fun doing it i felt this way when i was a kid and played the legend of zelda for the first time the storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things going places but doesn t flood you with details dungeons are fun to explore and you know you ll get something out of them there are clear rules to getting to the end but your path there is mostly up to you it s wonderful now to be clear there are some issues i have the ui is pretty unintuitive the important things are difficult to recognize as such but honestly they re so small compared to the highs i really don t care if you want your hand held you ll hate this if you want to feel like you re discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day this is for you
