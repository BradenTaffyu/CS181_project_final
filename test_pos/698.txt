2019 the game itself is pretty fun though some spray patterns sometimes feel random regardless of your bandwidth server s tickrate monitor refresh rate and other fps specific technical stuff you start to know about once you play for a while and know about cs go angles 98 damage made how the sound works etc etci believe you will get the most fun of this game only when you play lan with your friends against your friends official competitive as well as faceit esea etc makes me feel like this game is trash eventhough i know that the whole negative is all about its community also keep in mind that 1 the game is pretty popular 2 it s an fps 3 it s competitive which by default is a perfect soil for cheaters and some toxic people so i do recommend the game a definitely must try but well see yourself why but well in game
