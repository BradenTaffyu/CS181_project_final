this game is something to remember ill use this game to motivate me as no matter how low i go in life ill never be at a lower point than when i played this game if you can even call playing this game is like trying to hang yourself just to fall off at the last second then chop your arms off with a chainsaw and mauled by rabid dogs to again be saved at the last second and then when you wake up in the hospital jump out the window and right as you hit the ground you wake up in bed and cry for an hour because you wish it was real but other than that this game is is so super duper absolutely amazing ly bad and yet i still play it
