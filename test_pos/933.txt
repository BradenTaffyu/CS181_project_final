i m only writing this review because shadow of the erdtree was finally announced and i want to go on the record for anyone who never got around to playing it yet for whatever reason if you heard about the dlc and are thinking yeah maybe now is the time i ll finally dive in then this is directed at you elden ring is not for everyone if you don t respect the grind then it will kick the out of you without remorse there is no easy mode no save scumming no cheat codes and absolutely no hand holding yeah sure you can rely on youtubers and wiki pages to tell you what some of the ultimate builds might be but even if you re relying on a crutch like that you still have to put the work in and git gud when it s all said and done it also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons gear that those guides expect you to be using not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable so my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first i got every achievement defeated every boss and it was the most rewarding grind i ve ever embarked upon in a game i made a lot of mistakes along the way but i learned from every single one of them i got my ass kicked every time i booted up the game but every triumph i celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass kickings from the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs you truly feel every single victory and that s where i got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in elden ring i m telling you it is the ultimate dopamine shot now i personally loved the story but it s definitely a subjective experience elden ring is a mythological story about gods and demi gods and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions look closer at the game world and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would then you will probably enjoy it too if you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what s going on you might be disappointed without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the npcs you ve spoken to and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn t like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you ve skipped all the dialogue you need to listen and think about it and if you ve already progressed through certain points of the main story then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests this aspect of elden ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren t given any indication if you ve missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it s too late i will just say that if you re bee lining it straight to the main bosses you are definitely missing a lot of what makes the game so good and you re also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable items and experience so if you don t want to miss anything my advice is to take it all very slow and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas if you think you missed stuff keep in mind that you can always try again in ng multiplayer is completely optional but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character i will say that i personally played with the player messages turned off though because i didn t want to read possible spoilers and i felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion but to each their own if you ve never played elden ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time i truly envy you because i would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time it is a game like no other and it will test you in more ways than one just don t get discouraged when you hit a wall because we ve all been there all you have to do is learn to overcome it once you do i promise there is no greater feeling in all of gaming
