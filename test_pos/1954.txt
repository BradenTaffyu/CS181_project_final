i ll point out the same thing someone else said in a review as someone who s put nearly 200 hours across the betas and tests there s a severe abundance of misinformation being spread about the game so let s hit all the main points quickly shall we i m losing precious game time having to respond to these goofballs within hours of launch the team fixed the ability to create characters on other servers the gacha wish machine is used to unlock blueprints of some powerful weapons and it is a gamble the only two ways of receiving this currency is playing the game and available in the free battle pass tiers there s literally no way to exchange real money for this currency you have to earn it spyware cryptominer claims is just baffling the terms of service and privacy policy issue one guy read it and everyone else is vomiting that information based on that person s findings these terms are no different from the majority of other modern games you accept today i ll update this review when i see more nonsense being spread my take on this yeah they re 100 correct i ve played the betas and such before it hit steam half the nonsense you keep seeing about data is just idiotic firstly steam wouldn t in no way allow such a title with a wide threat as deep as you say to even be here period use common sense as for the terms though as the guy mentioned from the review i copied above this is essentially every eula ever which i now half of you skip through as usual so you never knew or cared til one guy spoke up and said some bs about it as for the game its self the devs have listened to a lot of feed back from the tests loving the direction its going and far from the bore fest it kinda felt like before as for over heating some people have cpu issues pegging their system at 100 usage thats usually a you issue look into it other wise yes it could be a bug wait it out and see my self 7900 xt 7900x 3440x1440 running it maxed around 98 115 fps ranges cpu sitting at 67c full time on air the game hardly uses any cpu honestly it sits at 3 5 to 3 8ghz vs its full 5 6 i see in most games so i suggest some of you check your pbo or other boost scenarios might be your issue as for intel they do have an issue as intel stated themselves for quite a few engines out there nothing you can do but undervolt and lower clocks
