2018 introductioni am a total slasher movie nut my favourite character from the genre jason voorhes the protagonist of friday the 13th got an awful game to my great sadness i wanted to like it i really did but no luck so i picked my dignity up from the floors of the playstation store and went back to good ole dead by daylight it is a game i ve always been delighted to play albeit it getting quite repetitive after some time if you play survivor or after you master your playable killers if you main said role i have to admit there have been periods of time when it was just gathering dust in my library but once i bought my first dlc there was no going back the entity had pulled me in the elephant in the roombefore i start judging the actual gameplay i need to adress the thing that most of you might be looking at when opening the game s store page the dlc why so much does it even help isn t it overpriced to be very brief this game is amazing even without any dlc first of all you can do great in the game without spending a single dime on the so called chapters since atm of writing this the strongest killer is the nurse which is integrated in the vanilla character pool and any survivor can do well in any tier so a chapter gives you a new killer and a new survivor 1 each survivor comes with 3 specific starting perks see the gameplay section which can be taught to other survivors by leveling them up until the perk becomes teachable and will appear in the bloodweb of others or you can purchase the perk directly with iridescent shards the currency you earn for leveling up your account if it appears in the shrine of secrets a part of the store with 4 perks which refreshes every week killer perks also available cool right reason nr 1 you don t have to buy any dlc 2 each killer and survivor that isn t licensed from a movie e g leatherface freddy etc can be purchased from the in game store for iridescent shards you can basically earn any content in the game that isn t licensed without spending real money that also means the you can get the licensed characters perks but once you put enough hours in the game you will want by yourself to purchase some dlc after all supporting devs is great gameplaythe premise is simple 5 players 1 killer 4 survivors either escape as a survivor or kill all the survivors as a killer a killer has a basic attack a lunge holding down the attack button will result in a longer range but proportionally higher exhaust time and a special ability if you miss the attack you get an exhaustion time in which you look down for a bit and become slower giving the survivor a very brief escape window the exhaustion applies on landed attacks as well but that time it s bigger the special ability is different from killer to killer and can manifest itself in a variety of ways such as placing bear traps teleporting throwing hatchets and much much more survivors are all the same gameplay wise having no special ability thus only being affected by the various perks in game and by the item they go into the trial match with perks buff certain actions see the killer s outline on the map for a certain amount of time when they break a pallet or can act as a double edged sword buffing a certain aspect but also having some sort of side effect a sprint at 150 of your speed for a certain amount of time but leaving you exhausted for a time items are common things such as toolboxes medkits or flashlights which break over time with usage and which are lost if you are killed in a match but fret not you ll get more than your fair share of items each item and perk has a rarity grade indicating their efectiveness survivors have to repair 5 generators repair speed which can be increased by using a toolbox and open the exit gates of the killer s hunting grounds to win the game the killer has to use sacrificial hooks to get survivors out of the game for good one hit injures the survivor making them grunt and leave trails of blood and 2 puts them in a dying state at which point they can be picked up and carried to an aforementioned hook during this time survivors can wiggle in a last attemp to escape the killer s grasp if they are put on a hook they can be released by a fellow teammate or if their time expires they die you can also attemp to escape on your own at the price of shortening the sacrifice time each time a survivor is put on the hook again the sacrifice advances to a point in which they will be instantly killed if it is their 3rd time on a hook at maximum the survivor can also evade a killer by stunning them with a pallet if dropped straight on them placed very conveniently all across the map for your convenience you can vault over the pallet but the killer needs to either consume precious time by breaking it or choosing an alternate route the maps also offer a variety of windows you can vault over and ledges you can drop from of course there are millions of strategies like tunneling rushing the generators stealth pallet looping and so on some of which are considered toxic see the community section but you will discover everything on your own once you get playing the systemsremember when i said that you ll get plenty of items well that is all thanks to the bloodweb the character progression system after a match you will get a certain amount of blood points based on your actions regardless of the match result the blood points are universal and you can spend them for any character be it a killer or survivor which makes playing with your main in order to level up another character a good pasttime the bloodweb offers various items item add ons you can start the trial with max 2 add ons on the item of your choice which buff the item s effects or could as well have side effects just like perks and perks because there are also a good amount of universal perks which you can capture in the bloodweb and level up a max 3 times depending on how many times you invested blood points in them killers and survivors also have ranks which are shared among all killers survivors you are ranked from 20 to 1 1 being the best rank depending on how well you do in games finally there is the general player level which rewards you with the iridescent shards i mentioned above for every level earned this might sound a bit complicated but believe me once you see it in game it all becomes clear as day i apologize for my poor explanation skills but i hope i managed to make you curious at least about the game now onto a more subjective matter communityeach game has toxic tryhards but at least the lower ranks provide a safe haven from them in dbd to make a long story short killer mains accuse survivors of being toxic because of them using valid strategies for winning and vice versa some survivors are indeed toxic teabagging at the exit just as some killers are camping a hook this is why some players derank on purpose to taste the good side of the game again the matchmaking can also be a bit dumb regarding this matter since every now and then you will get matched with someone 5 ranks lower or higher than you that s just how life is i guess but as long as you remember that you play for fun you should be all good conclusiondead by daylight is the best assymetrical multiplayer game the market has to offer right now it has a great slasher theme combined with supernatural elements at times you need not spend anything on dlc but you will once you see that the game deserves it with an easy to learn hard to master curve dbd proves to be great fun wether with friends or alone
