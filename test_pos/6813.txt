2017 note i played the maps on the playstation 4 console peasent ewww jk before i got black ops iii on the pc this review is mainly centered around the zombies mode of black ops iii let me start off with shadows of evil shadows is a great map however it is challenging and can be tedious at times by making you spend a small bit of time in the beginning of your playthrough to do the rituals and get to pack a punch its stressfull at times but is a really good and fun map shadows boss the margwa is also really challenging at times due to him needing to reveal his weak spot before you have the ability to kill him however the civil protector strategy makes the margwa a walk in the park the wonder weapons on this map are really damn good the apothicon servant and the swords which are an absolute blast to play around with and are both very useful to get to high rounds shadows has a great cast too with jeff goldbloom as nero or neal mcdonough as jackie f ing vincent the easter egg requires 4 unlike the other maps in black ops 3 which can be done solo so if you want to get the primiz rules calling card youre going to need some friends i do not reccomend this map to a beginner zombie playersecondly is the giant the giant is a great throw back to der reise and is really good for grinding experience or levelling up your weapons recomennded to a beginner zombie player to get his bearings and learn how to play theres not much to say about the giantthirdly is der eisendrache der eisendrache is a fun and relativley easy map once youve obtained the bows the easter egg was fun with a challenging boss at the end which was frustrating in the beginning but eventually i beat him and completed the easter egg the ending with blowing up the moon was fantastic and then killing dempsy 2 0 the boss the panzer wasn t as hard of a boss as its origins counter part but it still puts up a fight especially with his shock charges danger closest reccomended in the boss fight because of the shock charges the pack a punch is easy to get to and the camo for the pack a punch looks really damn good however the map is a piece of cake due to the lightning bow which when combined with alchemical anthesis you d be set for life the wonder weapon ragnorak dg 4s are fun to use but they too make the map really easy as it traps the panzer so you can easily shoot its core and the slam attack kills a hellavalot of zombies would reccomend to a beginner or intermediate zombie player fourthly is zetsubo no shima now this map got alot of hate when it first came out but i enjoyed the map especially playing it with friends because of the amount of crap you had to do to get to the power the map did introduce 2 new weapons the hg 40 and the marshal 16s both of which are good weapons the trashers were a real pain in the ass especially with the amount of them that could spawn within a round the wonder weapon the kt 4 wasnt really fun to play around with it was a decent wonder weapon though the skull of nansapwe however is really fun to play around with and is the best specialist weapon in zombies the map however is hard and the easter egg wasnt that great in terms of steps and the ending was fine the best part was them going to get the blood vials after the cutscene ended would not recommend to beginner zombie playersfiftly is gorod krovi i really enjoy gorod krovi it has to be my favorite map on black ops iii it had a variety of weapons the ppsh gkz mk3s l4 seige hg40 the wonder weapon gkz mk3 was a great addition to the mystery box as you dont have to go through chores in order to get the wonder weapon and the wonder weapon was great and it wasnt even too over powered it would start to become slightly useless around round 50 60 the ppsh was also a great throwback to world at war and it handled well the easter egg was fun to do even with gersh appearing as a step within the easter egg however some trials were very difficult to do in solo or to do without gobblegums such as in plain sight the boss fight was fun and the ending was great in my opinion the intro cutscene for gorod krovi has to be the best intro cutscene for any zombies map origins included especially with that refrence to peter mccaine as he falls through the aurora borealis the dragon was also a great addition to the map and made it much more challenging to play as if you stayed in an area for too long it would come and breathe fire in order to get you to move the gauntlet of seigfreid is a great specilist weapon packaged with your own mini dragon buddy and the dragon sheild is the best sheild in all of black ops iii the mangler the boss on the map isnt that hard to defeat however as the rounds progress they do get more health and get harder wouldnt really recommend to a beginner but its still a good map finally we have revelations well revelations is a very easy map eventhough it has hard bosses like the margwa elemental margwas and the panzer the weapons in the map such as the apothicon servant and the thunder gun thats right the thunder gun made the map way too easy you could get set up very easily with liquidation immolation firesale gobblegum and proceed your way to rounds in the triple digits the ending itself in my opinion was disappointing with it just telling us the cycle restarted and our characters were set back to origins where they start off as primis the boss fight was way too damn easy and could easily be accomplished the throwback to old maps is really good and the map layout and just the overall look to the map made it very appealing theres not much else to say about revelations it isnt a bad map but it isnt very good either now its time to wait for zombies chronicles edit zombies chronicles review will be out in a few days on the zombies chronicles store page
