2023 i ve been a counter strike fan since the early days and i was eagerly anticipating the release of counter strike 2 cs2 from the moment i booted up the game i was blown away by the visuals the source 2 engine brings the game s environments and characters to life in stunning detail and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive the gameplay is also top notch cs2 retains the core mechanics that have made counter strike a success for over two decades but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern the team based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever and the game s competitive depth is unmatched however my enjoyment of cs2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating i ve encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches and it s starting to ruin the experience for me it s frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game s competitive nature i know that valve is working on improving vac but it doesn t seem to be enough at the moment cheating is a serious problem in cs2 and it s something that valve needs to address as soon as possible overall counter strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren t for the prevalence of cheating
