2017 warframe is in my opinion one of the best mmo s out there with zero pay to win and developers that listen to the community even after 800 hours i still enjoy the game and there is still stuff to do especially since poe plains of eidolon update at the beginning of the poe update there were tons of bugs in the new region but it s gotten better now and is totally playable the game also has a really nice community which is pretty rare in other games honestly i definitely can recommend this
