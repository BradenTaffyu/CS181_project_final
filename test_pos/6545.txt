the first descendant is a game i started out very mixed on to the point this review would have been a do not recommend had i written it two weeks ago but eventually came around to a very positive opinion on to the point that it surprised me i had originally written an essay on my thoughts about this game that were one paragraph away from needing a glossary and a director s cut so instead i ll try to keep it short and readable in point form tfd is grindy very grindy korean mmo grindy if you like farming overlapping progression systems and sometimes mindless repetition you ll probably click with this you need to go into this being prepared for low drop rates multiple layers of rng and very little deterministic guaranteed progression once you reach the endgame the moment to moment gameplay is fun most guns just feel good to use hit feedback is crunchy and the sound design of most weapons is superb every character has a grappling hook included with their movement kit all good stuff here it s fun to just run around and shoot things in the face in the first descendant the monetization is okay it s pretty bad but it isn t as bad as you ve likely heard those 50 100 ultimate descendants you ve heard about i have three of them they didn t take forever to farm for and i didn t buy them the same can be said for just about everything else in the game including crystallization catalysts and energy activators if you re able to exercise some self control keep your wallet firmly away and view these things as aspirational goals to grind for you ll be just fine i did eventually buy the battle pass and a skin for my main character after 100 hours of gameplay that seemed fair to me but at no point did i feel the need to engage with any of the p2w leaning elements of the game and there hasn t been a single piece of content i haven t been able to solo excluding the four bosses that are co op exclusive the story is kinda bad and the only reason i m not calling it awful is because after around 10 hours i cared so little about what was going on that i turned the dialogue slider down to 0 and began indiscriminately skipping every cutscene maybe i made a mistake here and it gets good but i was so bored by the end of the first act that i just didn t care part of this can be chalked up to what seemed like generally pretty average bad writing but by far the biggest issue here is translation the developers are korean and i get the impression that some of the dialogue just didn t quite translate properly voice acting itself is a mixed bag sometimes it s awful sometimes it isn t half bad before i turned it off anyway this game is a blatant rip off of warframe in many ways bear in mind that i still like the game a lot but even stevie wonder could see the similarities here and make no mistake warframe is the better game this isn t even remotely debatable in my opinion but here s the thing i ve played warframe i ve played so much warframe so this isn t a negative for me it s a slightly different twist on something i already really like but your mileage may vary greatly here what i would say though is that if you find yourself really liking the gameplay systems here the mastery system the weapon and descendant modding the materials grinding the general one more run rhythm this game has and you somehow have not given warframe a shot yet i urge you to pick it up and try it acting as a gateway drug to warframe might prove to be the best thing the first descendant does time will tell i suppose
