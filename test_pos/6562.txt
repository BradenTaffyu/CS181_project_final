alright 200 hours all content finished review i am the big fan of borderlands destiny warframe closed beta player and other looter shooters heck i even liked anthem for different reasons tfd recycles a lot of ideas from its ancestors but it still feels fresh long story short i would rate this game 7 5 10 strongest points of the game community managers and developers actually communicates with the players and fix things really fast that is one of the most important points for live service mmo game with such attitude this game will live for really long time so if you are willing to start now but being afraid to lose the time since it might get closed don t think about it just try the game boss fights they look good the feel good if they keep adding good bosses with complex mechanics which requires good stats and teamplay its gonna be cool player progression is really friendly everyone can become powerful enough to clear all the content without being looter shooter veteran weakest points at the state of season 1 there is no endgame game really needs unlimited time missions where you can test your builds and characters otherwise there is almost no reason to maxing your stats since even the newest content got nerfed and it quite simple endgame is a difficult question its a problem of most games tbh story the lore is quite alright but the story itself is really bad most weapons are not interesting if we add the fact that gunplay is also mid its a bad combination of things a lot of people rather focus on their character abilities and not guns because of the reasons i mentioned above on average i think you will need at least 100 200 hours to maximize at least 1 ultimate char maximize at least 1 weapon the game is free so thats actually a really good amount of time you can spend here while always having something to do it is not a best game it is a decent game
