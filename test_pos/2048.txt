2023 throughout this game you will encounter nothing but players who spend their entire lives grinding to achieve top rank yes even if youre new you will go against top 500 players due to low server pop but worry not its not that hard you only have to choose from a bountiful of champs to pick from no they re not balanced at all but don t worry just become a meta slave and you ll be a okay meta will be a combination of trash champions that people with low self esteem and body oder that just wont go away and their mother has given up hope on employment for them no matter how much the community complains about the obvious advantaged other champs and weapons have above others there wont be a patch update for like 2 3 seasons and even then the nerf is hardly noticeable the term nerf to e24 only means reducing damage but 5 maybe this really doesn t change anything visibly sick there are a ton of weapons to chose from ranged and melee and an infinite way to combo with them which is amazing its too bad that in recent seasons they are only re skinning weapons that have the same move set and calling them new e g spear staff polearm and greatsword the difference between these weapons is very minor but im unable to blame e24 for this due to time not providing enough weapon variants throughout history anime fans will be hyped though there is big sword that skinny anime twink boy wields dagger that sneaky assassin has meta for that last 4 5 season no i wont stop complaining longsword oooo crouching tiger hidden dragon anyone dual blades are cool nunchucks wow so cool bruce lee so wow or some call numchucks because they cant read and lastly the weeb sword thats been folded over 10 000 times katana there are ranged weapons and they are about what you would expect from a melee focused game summary this game is fun you ll have a fun time not in ranked when you get bent over by a team that has 4k more hours than you weapons ranged and melee are all fun to use all champs are fun just balancing needs correcting but no dev gets it right so you ll just deal with it like everyone else overall you ll have a decent time
