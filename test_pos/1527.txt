2022 as of now total war warhammer iii does not exactly stand on it s own compared to total war warhammer ii due to a lack of content owing to its current infancy and lack of expansive addons and updates seen in warhammer ii this likely would not be the case if it shipped with mortal empires on day one and did not elect to release without add the very least a skin and bones placeholder version of the chaos dwarves instead using orks as a placeholder the game itself runs somewhat poorly it is not well optimized however this can be mitigated by running at a decreased resolution and lowered textures this however is entirely temporary and shouldn t factor into your interest but only your interest immediately unless you re a huge fan of kislev cathay chaos or the ogre kingdoms i would highly suggest delaying your purchase until the future when there is more content to be had as your time will likely be better spent in warhammer ii where you will still have access to the content from warhammer i and ii that being said chaos is an extremely well designed faction from a gameplay standpoint and has some unique mechanics that stand out from anything else creative assembly has ever made having tried out the first several turns of most factions by now i can safely but unfortunately say that the legion of chaos is by far my favorite which is unfortunate to me because i was mostly looking forward to the ogre kingdoms as for the campaign it is about as sandboxy as vortex was but with a new mechanic involving the invasion of each realm of chaos to slay a daemon prince as opposed to completing rituals as in warhammer ii i personally enjoy it lastly the minor settlements and siege battles i am not as adverse to the change as other people are while the supply system is bizarre at best i m not convinced that it is entirely detrimental to gameplay after playing a few rounds however i would appreciate a setting to be able to disable this mechanic and return to the old design i do enjoy the designs of the maps though and i really like the new survival mode for custom battles at it s current state i would suggest waiting for further updates unless you re a die hard fan of total war fantasy or any of the races in warhammer iii barring of course chaos dwarves i run an old am3 cpu 8gb of ddr3 ram and a gtx 1050ti which is an extremely obsolete setup for this game however after twiddling with the settings im able to run the game at about 57fps which is tolerable to me it is possible for me to gain almost 100fps at very low settings but the blurriness strains my eyes i d give it about a 7 10 right now you might enjoy it conditionally but i wouldn t recommend it to everyone
