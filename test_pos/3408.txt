2015 best game of 2015 grand theft auto has always been my favorite gaming series ever since gta vice city and still is the graphics and overall gameplay is massively upgraded from the consoles including animations textures particles depth of field motion blur shadows reflections cars and pedestrian density and animals just to name a few if you hadn t had a chance to play it yet at all though and your computer can handle it the pc version does definitely feel like the definitive version
