2022 this is a good game not a great game not a bad game but certainly a good game 7 factions and a handful of decent legendary lords to give you a sense of how to play the same sure the realms of chaos main story line could be annoying to deal with after a while but you re also getting to visit the realms of chaos what s not to like about that and if the main story line is still scaring you away don t worry each new dlc released up to this point has it s own narrative that takes advantage of the realms of chaos map but doesn t immediately force you to jump through another giant portal every 10 turns some of the stand alone stories and their content are actually really great look at champions of chaos 4 legendary lords each competing for the ultimate prize in a thunder dome battle to risk it all or take it all with their own unique blend of one of the 4 chaos god factions mixed in with the more standard chaos warrior faction and that dlc is at the asking price of about 15 20 unlike the 25 that we re seeing these days and if you re wanting to get deep into the lore then try out the immortal empires campaign which is completely free if you buy this game imagine having a game that spans the entire earth and every other county or country is run by a lord or a character with compelling story amazing abilities powerful faction mechanics and they re all competing or assisting each in creating the biggest fantasy empires you ve never heard about join the empire and lead the sons of sigmar against the horrors that threaten humanity or join one of those horrors and destroy the empire now granted you will have to get the other two games and dlc to experience all of that content but i genuinely think that it s worth your time and money heck there s even a lot of people out there on the internet who ve come up with all kinds of guides dlc buying guides tier lists recommendations for new players and everything you could ask for as a new player trying to jump into the game honestly even with the recent controversy going on i will confess that the greed of the company does hurt me to see and it certainly shouldn t be allowed to keep on going like it has but that shouldn t stop you from buying this game or anything related to this trilogy if you want to a lot of the dlc is more reasonably priced and if the public has their way we ll either see those newer dlc prices drop or double in quality to match that price so join us if you like it s always better to have more players and even with the concerning events going on surrounding the game right now this is still a great trilogy and worth your time and money if you are willing to pour the time into it
