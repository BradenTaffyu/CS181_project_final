2020 tough learning curve i feel this is not a regular fps where you run around and shoot everyone it s a tactical shooter where you have multiple operators with different abilities and you have to learn a lot before making your first kill or play decently on the first try i gave up playing this game because on newcomer lobby there are full of smurfs and nobody cared to explain how things work and toxic towards newbies with a bunch of youtube videos and some friendly help i started playing this and i am enjoying this now this is less action and more strategy oriented game you will have to learn to use gadgets and counter strategy based on operators your opponents are using etc etc and a lot of players are playing this game so there ain t any dead lobbies
