2020 apex legends apex legends is one of the best feeling fps games on the market everything is tight from the looting to movement the gunplay and so much more being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze apex legends proves it is here to stay monetization like most f2p games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop and for some skins in apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny along with the typical battle pass there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck there are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent albeit with a large grind attached most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard gunplay gunplay in apex legends is near perfect for any fps game period with 24 weapons available to choose from each feeling as great to use as the last every gun in apex is deadly if wielded correctly this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot there is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just click and once it does you ll never look at another fps the same the variety of recoil patterns enjoyable to master bullet drop etc all combine to provide the core of apex s masterfully crafted gunplay when you lose a fight in this game it doesn t feel cheap it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made if there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in apex legends it is skill one major facet of gameplay to note is that apex legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates this means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback this is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into apex as the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes mastering the gunplay and movement system in unison is key to constantly achieving that delicious chicken dinner a screenshot of by notaspy game modes apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked it also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours besides that apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace ranging from solos to snipers shotgun and many holiday themed events movement arguably one of the most popular aspects of apex legends is its movement system and how fluid it feels to traverse the map mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim the default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with with sliding down slopes to gain momentum being able to climb walls for a couple seconds are the basis of the movement system using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed just line in the gunplay after hours of experience it just clicks and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance looting a battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides and apex legends is no exception to this rule like i said with 24 weapons to find countless grenade types attachments med shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner as stated above every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a bad starting weapon isn t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre the first couple minutes of a hot drop is almost like a randomized deathmatch where the best team that utilizes abilities teamwork and aim to reign supreme not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun now previously i never really liked finding attachments in battle royals but in apex legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use so it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match which might sound bad on paper but in action it works extremely well almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game there are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor in other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick a real shot in the dark but in apex legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival from smoke grenades to firewalls sticky explosive there is a lot to play around with so managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry leads to inventory management being a key skill as well the possibility of your loadouts is almost endless the tools at your disposal are a revolving door of toys a screenshot of by notaspy roster with this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from each offering a completely different playstyle all with their unique advantages and disadvantages it is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat from pathfinder s grapple hook to help swing across maps wattson s ability to anchor down tight corridors crypto s drone for intel and that s not even scratching the surface each champion offers a unique passive tactical ability and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork 3 of the possible 15 champions to select from finding the right composition and the use of teamwork is crucial to becoming an apex predator a screenshot of by notaspy map design there are two maps currently in apex kings canyon and world s edge with the new map olympus being released today while they are by no means spectacular they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place both are filled with key landmarks that have you reminiscing of battles old and new there is a real focal point on elevation in apex legends which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times if there is one thing to take away from apex legends map design is to always have the high ground visuals sound despite apex legends stealth drop back in 2019 the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre apex legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from respawns doing at first glance the visual style might seem generic but soon you will see all the original love poured into apex s unique art direction running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards the sound quality of apex is also on par with its visuals each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you re up against from the kraber to re 45 each gun has a satisfying boom the real win in the sound design is the top notch directional sound in other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end whether you re in a building 200m away or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in apex is unmatched conclusion apex legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today there are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is apex legends please do yourself a favor if you like brs tight gunplay and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter apex legends is an auto play especially considering the barrier of entry that is being free to play overall score 9 10 visit
