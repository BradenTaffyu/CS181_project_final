2022 i am a 69 year old grandfather probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am the guardian to my grandson who is now 15 my grandson recently downloaded dead by daylight and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my grandson as he is always out with his friends and i was busy having parish zoom call meetings so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my grandson for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my grandson since i m no longer chairman of the parish council this game has ever since brought my grandson and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my grandson many happy memories
