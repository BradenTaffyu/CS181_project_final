try fingersbut holepickle on a more serious note this is genuinely one of the greatest games i ve ever played and not putting it in my top 10 would be criminal after the hours of enjoyment i ve had the world is breathtaking there isn t a single area of the game where if you stop and take a breather for a second or two you ll be hitting f12 a couple of times the variety of locations are insane i won t say much to avoid spoilling but i was often shocked at the amount of ideas they managed to cram into this world without it feeling unnatural there are some traps in the game that teleport you to late game areas and you ll be shocked at how big the map is how cool the areas are and how the common dog just one taps you it makes it so when you actually reach these locations through progression it feels really good to not get one shot or actually one shot the enemies that were giving you such a hard time besides that exploration is fun and feels actually really good usually in your skyrims and copy pasted ubisoft open world titles you just look at your compass at the top of your screen and hold w in the direction that has the most appealing icon sure you re exploring but you re not actually looking at the route you re taking in elden ring the compass only tells you the cardinal directions so if you want to find anything you either have to look at your map to see if there are any points of interest or actually look around using your eyes to spot interesting things this gave me the same feeling i had with breath of the wild a few years ago where i m supposed to do one thing but i just see another cool thing after another i just get sidetracked for hours the bosses are what you expect from a soulslike tough maybe rage inducing if you suck but fair if you haven t played a soulsbourne game like i have before this one this is easily the best intro you could have to them all the bosses are great the build variety you can have in this game is seemingly limitless if you struggle too much on a boss you can just go into the open world and come back when you re better the only flaws i have with this game is that it s in a serious need of a questlog it s not normal that i have to have the wiki open on my second monitor just to remember what a npc said 60 hours of gameplay ago and it could take the ultrakill way of death what i mean is that if you die you click r no loading screen you spawn right back into the boss room i hated the commander niall runback
