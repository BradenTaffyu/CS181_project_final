2022 elden ring was released almost 3 years after the first announcement but i can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait till the end i think it is an excellent upgrade to dark souls 3 i loved mechanic of the ashes of war big open world and build variety quite there are badass and cool bosses like malenia maliketh mohg etc but i have to say dark souls 3 has cooler bosses like slave knight gael sister friede and nameless king pve i have stopped counting after the 15th run lore in the game is beautifully and smartly designed pvp it is hell of a fun but please don t use hp estus in the middle of the duel guys come on in addition maybe u can show some respect to people who duel by not interrupting their fight these criticisms are for people who play that way so i don t blame people in general or the game itself long story short elden ring will be on the top unless bloodborne 2 elden ring 2 dark souls 4 releases this game is a blessing to the world this is the sentence i have been telling to my friends since it was first released and my opinion has never changed at all my recommendation rate is 11 10 one more thing to say i hope we can get a dlc soon
