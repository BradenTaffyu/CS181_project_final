2020 fun game to get into with a lot to do the new player experience is terrible though so get used to reading the wiki and viewing tutorials in order to really like the game you need to be able to set goals for yourself because the game never explicitly tells you what you can or should do next my recommendation is to just complete as many missions in the star chart as you can and enjoy the story quests that begin to pop up on the later planets the second dream and the war within are probably the two best pieces of content the game has to offer in terms of story and cinematic experiences as for other content plains of eidolon and fortuna are awesome as well i still have yet to kill or capture an eidolon and have no clue about anything regarding the orb mothers it may appear to be pay to win at first but it s really not as you can earn everything in game via trading and grinding and the things you can purchase really don t have much of an effect on the way the game is played since you still have to level them up and mod them to be able to play higher end content in short it s free to play if you re interested give it a try it s not for everyone but i d always recommend trying it who knows you might like it
