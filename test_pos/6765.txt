2018 part 3 3 of my black ops series reviewintroductionif you are the type of call of duty fan that i am you most likely enjoyed the black ops except the third installment maybe and modern warfare games the most and that s good because for most of us this is where the franchise peaked both in quality and story wise if you play games like call of duty for the story so now with possible rumours of black ops 4 on the way in 2018 i embarked on the quest of reviewing the series and hopefully help some of you who still haven t made up your mind about your opinion on call of duty i will say it straight from the beginning the black ops series is worth it at the very least let s see why campaignso you liked the story of alex and david mason you liked the way those characters were built and the intense narrative you want more of the soldiers you know and love lol no you treyarch decides to throw all of that in the trash and start anew with a story that has absolutely no link to the previous black ops games i m gonna be 100 honest with you here i didn t understand a single bit of black ops 3 s tale that it s so desperately trying to deliver in an interesting way spoiler alert it s not interesting at all while the other games were engaging and had deep beautifully constructed plots bo3 is a story about if i know you basically play as a custom character don t expect any depth to the level of customization it s about 3 faces and 2 caps and that s it which loses his her limbs in an operation that goes terribly wrong then you get on a mission to destroy the illuminati or something honestly it s quite twisted what i m trying to say is that the campaign isn t in the last bit memorable not the characters not your motives not anything it s just a big mess that s probably why you see so many train go boom memes and black ops 3 ending explained videos on youtube but the gameplay of the campaign in itself is alright the new thing is that you have some new enhanced abilities which are actually pretty fun to use multiplayerwhile many people don t take this game seriously because of the new movement mechanics i can tell you the multiplayer here is quite solid unlike other cod games here you have specialists you can use in multiplayer instead of random perk specific character models these specialist have some abilities which give you an edge against other players for example a bow with explosive arrows invisibility traps with nano bees that kill any enemy that steps in them it sounds ridiculous i know or some portable seismic charges that insta kill nearby enemies it may sound overpowered but you mostly get 1 or max 2 kills with it because of the short range and the fact that sometimes you don t even get to use them since you have to jump to trigger them and the enemy can kill you in mid air the new movement system with sliding and thrusters which allow you to glide or jump higher is actually well implemented and smooth it can make for some interesting plays or can be very frustrating at times depending on the situation but overall it s a nice experience zombiesthis is the part where black ops 3 shines the most this is without any doubt the best cod game for zombies mode yes you have the classic 4 dlc formula for unlocking the current zombies maps but there s also a dlc called zombie chronicles which allows you to play better remastered versions of almost all of the zombies maps in previous cod games that is just awesome besides the fact that in the age of steam workshop you have hundreds of user submitted maps at your disposal maps which are pretty damn good most of the time even if you don t buy any dlc the user maps and shadows of evil the zombies map you get by default are still gonna ensure you have a blast if you buy this game only for this mode my respect to treyarch for this amazing top notch zombies experience conclusionblack ops 3 is overall a pretty good game being the best call of duty for zombies mode and having a fun multiplayer mode i say it s still worth the 60 price tag just don t expect wonders from the campaign or even better don t even play it pros steam workshop allows for countless hours of fun with zombies maps modifications to the multiplayer are a nice change of pace zombie chronicles dlc is worth every single pennycons horrible story my black ops 1 review black ops 2 review
