2021 this game owes a lot to rogue nethack angband you start out as a weak character and can delve into a dungeon armed with the weakest of weapons and a potion which may or not be helpful rather than rogue s ascii 2d top down dungeon you have a terraria style 2d ant farm crafted in individual pixels the dungeon is structured as procedurally generated layers or biomes in a persistent framework which can be learned there are numerous secrets and mysteries the only way to make progress is to spawn experiment and die spawn experiment and die you ll find new items and start to build a library of spells monsters perks and an understanding of how the world is constructed and how to survive and then time your stay in a particular biome to give you the tools to push on a bit further each level is an engine of chaos and the whole game is an exercise in chaos management monsters fight each other trigger environmental hazards pick up wands and use them potion bottles shatter the liquids cascading down through the level interacting with the terrain vapours rising causing further explosions corrosion or hazards explosive barrels of various types are scattered about some levels feature exposed electrical appliances lava acid strange articulate machinery at every death you kick yourself and or curse the game your early runs will see a hundred or more deaths before reaching the foot of the dungeon later on you will have developed a sixth sense about when to risk grabbing a piece of gold and when to move on you will also have noticed mysteries and oddities in the landscape that beg to be investyigated what happens if i kick this how about if i pour this kind of potion in there what s up there why can i drill that rock if it is a boundary and what lies beyond the craziness of the chaos makes it hard to play on after you have invested 30 minutes into a run only to see it torched because of some monster picking up a deadly wand and destroying itself and you in a screen wide cataclysm or when you ve pushed your luck too far and you die immediately to some avoidable danger when you could have easily gone through the gate and restored your health it is without doubt a great game but pixels are harsh man it s not for everyone and i wonder how long i am going to keep taking the punishment
