2014 this game has become a great fps in my library i played a cs mod many many years ago tactical ops assualt on terror and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time i finally bought global offensive and i ve been impressed everything i was expecting and much more it s a simple fps with different modes search and destroy hostange rescue tdm and more i will give you the warning it s very difacult to be good at this game the level of compitition is great i honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun i typically play just competitive matches where it s a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match it varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life sounds hard right exactly competitive is a blast i highly recomend this game if you like fps and like playing online use stradegy play with friends play with strangers and remember do not play this without headphones if in public place the bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud just saying my rating 9 5 10 very awesome game
