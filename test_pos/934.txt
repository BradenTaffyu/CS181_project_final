2022 the lands between me and the elden ring this is going to be a long one go get a cup of coffee if you care enough about it you know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world elden ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in the lands between fight your journey through dungeons and catacombs find treasures get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings talking to npcs reading items descriptions finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there it s everything we always wanted in a classic fantasy medieval rpg for the first days if i could i would not have stopped playing this game by any means i just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it s secrets so much fun especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize they are in a totally different area that you don t even got to explore yet but the game gives you that freedom you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress by your own pace and your own way the combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn t give you the hitboxes are better the battles are fluid when you don t have that fps drop from nowhere but i ll get there and i truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game there s a reason people can beat this game without getting hit and even though of course many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way you can and will git gut take your time after you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it the soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing you can hear the noises inside dungeons the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks the screeches of the creatures the mad whispering of the anguished souls the water flows the birds chirping everything feels natural and involving everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it s nature as far as the lore goes it s a souls game it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about it hints you about it s mysteries and what s happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable and all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn t really do anything else about it letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish you ll have your own theories at the end of the game wondering what could possibly follow your decisions what will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it the ring was a bit broken though well not everything is as amazing as it could be being very straightforward some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better after the first patch things got better and it s far from being unplayable but the game still struggles in some areas and that it s not dependent on hardware rather it s probably related to the way it was programmed hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can conclusion all in all it truly is an amazing game and i m happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations it s certainly a title that ill keep coming back to play more in the future it s hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could and that alone is something that i was sure looking forward to
