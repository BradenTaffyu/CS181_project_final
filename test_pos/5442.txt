99 of my playtime goes way back when this was released but i recently came back for a couple of matches with friends glad to see the game still alive and well after all these years this might easily be one of the best competitive shooters ever made for sure the greatest title ubisoft released in the last 10 years extremely complex and tactical the fast matches and destructible environments keep it great fun all the way through the learning curve for both casuals and sweaties considering how low the price gets with discounts i would advice any fps fan to pick this up and give it a try especially if they have some buddy to experience it with
