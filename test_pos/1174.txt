do you know what s worst about this game apart from the repetitive bosses and toxic players the open world and basically elden ring can be your first easiest or most difficult game from fromsoftware and it s up to you which solution you choose it took me a while to understand that i don t have to run where the site of grace shows me and i don t have to fight every mob or small boss i meet on my way there are so many elements that allow us to trivialize the game and bring it to a critical state where we can defeat the boss on the first try and the game becomes easy at this point maybe too easy there are so many easily accessible items scattered around the map just waiting for you to find and collect them that s why the experiences of elden ring players differ so dramatically and it turns out later that someone completed the game with a weapon that wasn t fully upgraded walked only on the main bosses and only on 6 estuses and i could explore look for side bosses upgrade my weapon to the maximum level and the number and power of estuses and have no major problem completing the game and the experience is immediately uneven this only shows that the game can be difficult but it doesn t have to be as i got more and more interested in the game i easily noticed that part of the elden ring community is a kind of special social group of sweaty little guys who have epileptic seizures when you say that you defeated the boss using summons or generally didn t do it the way they did which means probably harder with no hit and with a stick people are able to insult you up to 3 generations back for using normal mechanics in the game which are absolutely not forbidden and are optional gamer culture is pure rot and no matter how you play people will always find a problem with something this game has quite a lot of lore and it will take us some time to understand all of it and it will allow us to understand how much we could have missed while playing the game but it will also allow us to understand the stories of the characters we have to face in the fight the way elden ring is told requires reading items listening to all the dialogues with understanding and connecting the dots and yet most players will end up on vaatividyj s channel looking for the meaning of the fight with a given boss but in a nutshell elden ring is really a big family problem however i don t think elden ring would be a good soulslike for someone who has not had anything to do with this genre of games before because i think the open world can quite easily overwhelm and lose a new player and also make each subsequent soulslike seem too easy or too difficult it s all depends how you ll be playing this game boje si eldeniarzy
