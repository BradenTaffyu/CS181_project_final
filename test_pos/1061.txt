2023 even if it does violate the golden order these are some of the first words you will hear in elden ring it plants a mystery in your mind that persists until the very end i knew right then that this game was something beyond special elden ring is a difficult game especially for new comers like me who are new to the souls series of games but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step i took the environments the bosses the silent storytelling of the world around me was so unique the more i played the more i wanted to know and i fell deep down the rabbit hole of this game s world i will never forget the cinematic landscapes you see for each new area the distant castle walls or giant golden trees it is truly something you need to experience the gameplay itself is quick and tight the bosses pose interesting challenges that respect your time slaying a boss especially the ones in the main story feels like you really did something substantial as often the world changes around you in their absence you are only ever given one goal in elden ring that truly matters become the elden lord no matter the cost
