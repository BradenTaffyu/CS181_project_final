2022 i am malenia blade of miquella and i have never known defeat my love a screenshot of elden ring by h artl ss fromsoftware took the risk of creating an open world and they succeeded they moved away from the corridor approach giving the player the opportunity to choose their own pace of passage leisurely exploring or rushing to collect key demigod bosses to advance in the plot the abundance of content turns the first playthrough into a 100 hour adventure the world of elden ring is tragic and beautiful george r r martin helped develop the characters stories although as he himself said in an interview he contributed only a small part to miyazaki s large scale ideas the comedy component lies in the names being similar to each other without a doubt j r r martin had a hand here so that in addition to you died players thought about who they talked to and who gave the task malenia miquella marika mohg morgott margit melina maliketh miriam maleigh marais miriel millicent mary maureen moongrum radahn radagon renna ranni rennala rykard rogier roderika rileigh gideon godfrey godrick godwyn gostoc gowry ghiza the game was adjusted so that you could complete all the quests in one playthrough neither quest line interferes with another in ds it was impossible to have all or almost all endings immediately available it was necessary to carefully complete the quests in order to reach a certain ending but this is done to attract new blood so that nothing is screwed up or missed in principle this is a good solution since it takes a lot of time to master most of the content that is few people will replay it again for an additional portion of achievements unfortunately i didn t like that the easy walkthrough was aimed at magicians if as usual as in ds you pump up health strength agility endurance then it doesn t really work i saw how players with pumped up intelligence and a set of spells passed bosses so the host calls me and the second assistant we go to the boss the magician stands in the middle and activates comet azur all the boss was blown away otherwise a lot of fun comes from silent communication with random players everyone is different everyone is interesting that s why i really love the community polite bows when summoned thank you after killing a boss synchronized snapping of fingers she helped other players countless times and she also helped me many times i liked the idea of summoning ghosts wide choice of companions i liked the wolves i ran like princess mononoke while the wolves are gnawing off my sides i do the bulk of the damage i expected more from the false tear but i found it after a couple of patches when the ai intelligence was cut i found out that my tear really likes to eat turtle necks if they don t beat me need to chew the most chilling boss was the secret one dragonlord placidusax i drank a lot of blood in some places he couldn t calm down and launched special attacks without a break the relief of winning was phenomenal elden s beast is in second place the brightness hurt me i also liked malenia as a boss my respect seems to be the same type as the incipient attacks from which it was not always possible to dodge the battle with renalla was aesthetically beautiful both the first and second phases were delight and pleasure you can write a lot of good things about elden ring because the game deserves it i wish you victory in the game of the year nomination and that more people can experience the beauty i recommended recommend and will recommend for purchase
