2021 ah rainbow six siege i hate it i love it i hate it agghhhhh it s siege one of the few games with an extremely toxic community but also a super wholesome community at the same time i ve played this game for years now on console and now pc help me i don t know why i keep coming back to this game it is incredibly fun and offers gameplay like none other altogether i love this game all the hilarious moments and clips from playing with friends make this game fantastic would definitely recommend for fun but this is totally detrimental to your health there are some annoying glitches at times such as the cursor glitch which prevents you from being able to look around with your mouse and requires restart would rate siege 10 oh and don t buy operators those are for sweats stick to recruit with lmg or shotgun and you ll be a platinum 69 like me edit i have a few things that i feel very fondly about that i would like to address here while siege can be a blast while playing with a full squad of friends solo queue ranked or even duo queue is miserable in low tiers towards the end of last season i began playing ranked to see where i stood i enjoyed ranked a lot on console because i like a challenge i ranked silver i forget the specifics but i want to say it was mid range kept playing ranked till the end of the season and really enjoyed it i met some really enjoyable people and only a couple who were toxic overall a good experience this season high calibre it has been the exact opposite i ranked in high bronze which at first i was fine with i could work with it now the problem begins once you start matchmaking with toxic players i ve noticed a trend of coming across players that i have previously matchmade with which was fun at first until i began seeing the same toxic players that griefed me and my teammates relentlessly without consequence this is extremely mentally draining you want to play the game you love but others are ruining it i have even seen players that i have reported and blocked return to my matchmaking after all of that the worst part is if you leave to escape the toxicity you are the one with the punishment not them some of you may be thinking that you can just mute them and move on but with the team kill aspect in the game they can still run around your operator all game until you accidentally team kill this is a massive problem and now i am stuck in a copper v limbo all players are toxic and it is impossible to improve my mmr to rank up and escape i have seen other players in my lobby feel the same way and it obviously should not be that way it would be easy to simply add an mmr reset button or mmr reset request option
