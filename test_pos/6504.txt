2017 you gotta love how most negative reviews are from people with less than 150 hours and most positivites are from people with 500 hours this speaks for itself for me personally dead by daylight is the best game in this kind it s unique have good game mechanics it s rewarding and have high replay value with procedurally generated progression and maps i think this all togethers creates a good game which can be enjoyed by boths sides survivors and killers while game totally have a lot of balancing issues the core gameplay aspect is satisfaying enough to ignore them and simply enjoy hiding from killer or blasting survivors on hooks the devs are doing livestreams every week to keep in contact with the community and inform of the upcoming changes or playerbase concerns so i do really believe the balance issues and bugs are going to be fixed sooner or later the upcoming patch 1 5 seems to be turn in good direction for example now that i talked about good things lets go to the bad ones that i will try to explain thoroughly swf is broken so is normal matchmaking for killers sometimes i feel like i m spending a lot of time in lobby as killer finding game as survivor is easy though i would love this game to receive dedicated servers but it s not gonna happen most likely which is sad perk balance could be better currently the survivors meta which i don t follow personally i find it boring bases around saving yourself not your team it s all about self care sprint burst or decesive strike boring boring boring buff the perks that benefit the team to encourage teamplay and more altruistic gameplay killers meta is actually more varied than survivors one since every killer is unique on it s own with it s own power the movement speed the killer size and lunges all these things actually affect the perks you would want to use on a said killer so while meta for killers definately exist for example machinegun or mirror builds are very popular it s still in much better place than survivors pallet looping and camping i have my own personal opinion on that and most would disagree with me i think both of those things actually hurts the one using it so it s not a huge issue that anyone should be angry about both are just a bad strategy that does not benefit you in any way pallet looping generally is going to waste more killer time sure but is also going to make any map pallet less in 5 10 minutes which in effect is going to make it harder for your other 3 teammates to escape the killer in a long run if you want to survive as entire team you should start actually breaking line of sight hiding from the killer behind trees or obstacles not abuse the pallet looping and make it harder for your team camping you camp hook other survivors do gens you lose the match with one kill if you are satisfied with that well good for you but survivors won nothing more to say bloodlust in 1 5 is totally going to reduce survivors abusing the pallet looping and infinites while killers would be more encouraged to actually leave the hook since the speed boost to chases both sides win toxic community if you could ever call them a community most of the people complaining flaming baiting and trolling are the ones that play the game the least but sit on steam forum the most once again bad reviews from less than 150 hours the real community is busy playing the actual game if i could ever suggest something to devs it would be to balance the f all survivor perks and encourage improve stealth aspect of the game in some way whenever it would be new game mechanic stealth points new stealth perks or new ways to hide from killer this would encourage players to actually hide and use pallets less overall i think the game is worth the try been enjoying it since i bought it and i can see myself mastering every aspect of it and finding suitable perk builds ones that does not contain self care and sprintburst for sure from killers i mostly enjoyed wraith love the invisibility power and strategizing when and where to strike but i can see myself playing trapper after 1 5 comes out since he received buff to the trap placement speed taking all what i wrote into consideration i would give this game 8 10 1 for perk balance and boring meta respect to those who actually uses perks that benefit the team 1 for devs taking so slow to fix the issues since release if devs want to make the game more stealthy and less runny runny it shouldn t take them 10 months to get to the conclusion how to accomplish that i hope my review helped anyone to decide whenever to buy this game or not cheers
