2019 gtav is one of my absolute favorite games even if not everything s perfect there is the story mode this is the positive part of the game a great story with indescribably great characters a detailed and big world there s so much to explore the graphics are already breathtaking with great attention to detail but there is also the online mode that s downright ridiculous endless loading time overpriced content boring missions i m annoyed by gta online and i don t play it anymore nevertheless i rate the game as positive because the main game the story mode is just awesome
