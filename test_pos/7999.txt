2021 alright i m apparently 451 5 hrs in played this more than any game whilst having the busiest period of my life and in many ways it helped me get through it all somewhat intact thank you noitathis is a recommendation for those of you who use games therapeutically 450 hrs in this is probably the most useful review i can write this is what noita does for me positives spiralling thoughts calm down escalated thoughts that grim area beyond spiralling thoughts are actually shut down very quicklythis surprised me due to the games unforgiving nature and often surprising and immediate deaths somehow dying in noita seems reasonable even to the most primal parts of you acceptance of death is immediate and even oddly satisfying yes you are right this is how i died and it was fine if you know that acceptance is just not you and you will definitely want to get back at the game you can also do that you can build wands in this game that will be too hard to handle for any cpu i don t have that urge but there s plenty of very nice twitch streamers out there who play this game daily dissecting every little pixels of it and figuring out how to obliterate every pixel your cpu can muster to sputter out lots of updates to the game without destroying the main loop which your brain has been squeezing for dopamine etc both devs and an active mod scene are amazing if you do need to edit your game loop more drastically from time to time to get your brain chemicals going as needed negatives it can get you hookednow you know there s a scale to this and after 450 hrs of exposure i can say i have not once played noita instead of completing urgent or major tasks minor tasks yeah of course skip those play noita noita did prevent me from going to sleep a couple of times but those incidences also coincided with particularly stressful days which might have caused me to avoid sleep in a different way tl drif your therapist has asked you if you ve tried meditation also try noita i stuck with noita as meditation makes me angry
