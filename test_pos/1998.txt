2021 naraka bladepoint has got to be my favorite pvp game of all time after 400 hours of gameplay i still play almost daily i have yet to find a melee fighting game where the combat feels so smooth if you like samurais ninjas sword fighting martial arts and parkour this is the game for you the game has a difficult learning curve it matches you against bots your first couple games giving you a bit of confidence only to lose it once you start fighting real players practicing combos counters dodges etc against bots in free training will go a long way also a recent addition to the game is bot mode allowing you to play the survival mode against all bots whenever you want if you find you are getting wrecked by more seasoned players of the game if survival mode and battle royales aren t your thing there is a deathmatch mode called bloodbath where you get to fight and revive endlessly the character customization is very detailed allowing some fascinating and horrifying creations i personally enjoy playing as a super saiyan pikachu and get a good laugh every time i log on i see lots of complaints about high ping abusers cheaters and although i am not very high ranked plat v i frankly have rarely encountered this if ever while it may be an issue at the highest ranks the majority of the player population new players especially should not encounter this on top of that plenty of americans my friends included will name their characters account in mandarin even if they speak perfect english you may feel you re getting wrecked by some chinese vpn ping abuser when in reality it is some dude across town who has played a few hundred hours more than you if you need to win every match this may not be the game for you at the end of the day slashing people with swords and zooming across the map with grappling hooks akin to attack on titan is my favorite thing to do right now patience is a virtue in this game and accepting the difficult learning curve and embracing the process of always trying to get better will hopefully allow you the enjoy it as much as my friends and i have see you all on morus isle
