2022 despite the rough release with the immortal empires update assuming you can grab game 1 2 and the dlc on the cheap this game has become insane 80 playable factions and dozens of races on 1 gigantic map there s almost too much content now it took 6 months but this game is the pinnacle of the series you could play this game for 500 hours and still not play every faction
