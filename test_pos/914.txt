2022 i honestly believe all of the people who say that elden ring has unplayable fps and microstutters i ve been lucky to be in that goldilocks zone where my hardware doesn t encounter any of that any frame rate dips only occur when quickly moving through environments load times are about five seconds at the most when using fast travel on a i79750 rtx2060 and 16gb of ram the game itself is a marvel the addition of jumping reintroduction of powerstances and weapon arts make it the darkest of all dark souls just refund it under steam s 2 hour played policy if you re encountering performance issues otherwise you re missing out on a really neat game
