2022 let me be clear as far as i am concerned this game is impossible simply because i would get bored of it long before i could ever master the patience skill and luck required to actually beat this game with that said the journey is definitely the focus on this one it is a lot of fun to explore and discover new things and you will be thinking about it more then you would like to admit the shear fragility of the player makes it that much more rewarding when you discover new places or get farther then you ever did before only to have that joy thrown away because you die to some stupid reason where you don t even know what happened if you want to see the end of this game i highly recommend using mods though you will discover there is a special charm that you will lose by playing with mods something that truly comes from the difficulty of it i hope you are happy spending 100s of hours becoming a wizard knowing this game more intimately then you know yourself if you wish to reach the end in vanilla i simply do not have the time or care for that myself but i have a lot of fun playing this game i can certainly see myself picking it up again for a few runs even if the earlier sections feel like a chore after the 100th time trying to get through them never play noita hoping to reach the end and you will find fun in it as painful as this game is to play sometimes i cant not recommend it it has a lot of soul to it and is definitely a piece of art of a video game
