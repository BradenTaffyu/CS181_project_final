2022 every noita run you will learn and gain something new it makes a stoic scientist out of you whilst occasionally sending you into fits of hysterical laughter disbelief or rage from witnessing how you died but then you make a mental note of how you died so that you don t die in the same way next time and fire up another run the online noita community inspires you enter the cave again and again hoping you ll survive until you can find more interesting spells and wands or stumble across wand components that synergise in fascinating ways you learn and tinker with different spell combinations like some alchemist scavenging and salvaging pieces of wands and spells hidden throughout each stage as you slowly become consumed by the manic thirst for knowledge of the noita witch itself this is not a game to binge noita is a hobby that is nurtured with time i found a single typical noita sitting to last 30 to 90 minutes i stopped when i found myself rushing through runs and dying sometimes i stop playing for a week but then i come across a youtube video of some ridiculous noita stuff so i return for a while again this is not a game to binge but one to enjoy over a long period of time hopefully one you ll keep on revisiting to have these nice moments too
