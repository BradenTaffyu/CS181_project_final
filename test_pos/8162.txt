abandon all hope ye who enter this game i wouldn t recommend this game to most people and this probably includes you this is not a casual game it is unlike any other game i have played it is not like terraria or a metroidvania it is brutal and it is punishing you can expect to spend more than a hundred hours before your first win until that win all of those in game hours will end in frustration and grief but noita is also a fascinating game it is complex interesting baffling and endlessly engaging it would seem while it is single player it is so difficult that you are forced to connect with the community to learn how to play while noita rarely grants you the satisfaction of discovering things for yourself it cultivates a community who support and congratulate each other and that is very enjoyable i bought this game twice the first time i bought it on a different platform but i gave up on the game and resorted to mods and work arounds after 119 hours of dabbling and learning i bought it again on steam determined to start afresh and get a legitimate win after an additional 41 hours i attained that win excluding the hundreds of hours spent engaging with the noita community to learn how to play this game is a journey a tribulation an enigma and if you think it may be for you try it out
