2018 tl dr this game is not perfect very far from it however i ve had too much fun not to recommend it so much needs fixing such as the emblem system and broken animations but this game is good and the devs keep it fresh with updates and dlc main review deep down there is a part of me that wants to downvote this due to many reasons such as a poor ranking system that does not reward you well for how you play it rewards you for the way the devs want you to play you must be chased and escape you must heal and unhook and you must do generators and escape the trial i like the concept of being a team player and i tend to do all of the above but some games you can t some games you get chased the whole time and never do generators but you ve been a great distraction or someone else unhooks and heals before you can get there because you were doing the objective yet you will never rank up because you did not play the perfect game you did not check all of the boxes playing as killer is a chore as you get flashed teabagged and looped as a new player and its just not fun however this is all i ve known as i came after the new emblem system update and i ve had fun i don t really play killer so survivor is my main lol i ve had some awesome surivivors that have played well and played as a team i ve had awesome killers and everyone played the game the way the game should be played i ve had some funny moments despite it being bugged when i think of this game i think of those moments where 4 people have disconnected and the killer took me to hatches etc sure thats not the way it should be but its moments like that i remember i rememeber this over the game default selecting dwight so i had to play a level 1 dwight with no perks or where i get a pig mask but the boxes were bugged out of the map so i died honestly its one of those games where i turn a blind eye at the faults and laugh at how simply fun this game really is from the mostly greatly designed maps to the well thought out killers deep leveling system with amazing perks and add ons the sounds that make you shiver and the fun you have with almost all of the games i can recommend it just purely for these reasons sure i don t have many hours compared to most yes i joined the game late and yes i still don t know everything to know about this game yet i m enjoying it and will put way more hours into this good game again its not great or near perfect but i keep coming back to it
