so i finally bit the bullet and got this despite the repeated frustrations of random ganking by allies in most total war games first off i have to say that the review bombing for the game not having immortal empires on release is pretty stupid nothing releases perfectly these days and a degree of patience is expected also let s face it ie is only a pat on the head for everyone that just got stuck to playing certain of the old factions so it s just more of the same secondly it s easy to ignore the fact that there have been massive quality of life improvements with wh3 going back and playing 2 again is an absolute snore fest by comparison not to mention that it is vastly inferior graphically the prologue tutorial is fun and vastly superior to having to mess around with individual tutorials with an advisor blathering on about the most remedial rubbish from previous tw games if you ve ever played a single tw game of any kind you can either set advice to low or turn it off altogether for those worried about the crazy amount of dlc when you include those from 2 you needn t because they are all optional and not needed in any way shape or form outside of multiplayer if you are on a budget then do yourself a favour and just get the base game and install radious mods which add more to the game for free than any dlc outside of the cool prologue what you have here is a more interesting new main campaign more and far more delineated and interesting factions cathay is clearly the jewel in this new crown and they are great fun to play khorne are massively changed from the old beastmen demon prince is powerful and fun and continues directly from the prologue and chaos dwarves which have a completely different campaign to the others works like a total conversion mod if you decide to get that particular dlc throw in the fact that for those who actually want more of the same being able to use everything they bought previously through mortal empires and you have a vast overall improvement from 2
