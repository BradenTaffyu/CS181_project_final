product received for free this game is very much inspired by warframe and other looter shooter games there is plenty of content a lot of descendants at launch weapons a full campaign and enough end game content to keep you occupied pros great looking game characters maps locations etc performance and optimisation is pretty solid too for me 1st gen ryzen 5 cpu radeon 6600 gpu 16gb ram plenty of descendants with different playstyles to choose from they can all be unlocked free even if a bit grindy more updates and roadmap revealed and all looks promising cons monetization needs a bit of rework battlepass isn t good no descendant skins in the bp lots of emotes etc it costs the equivalent of 10 which is fine but you don t get enough currency back to buy the next one as is the case in other games current selection of skins is also a bit limited basically 3 4 outfits for all of them pretty much buying ultimate skins is very expensive sold in bundles priced 60 100 a few other minor issues like robototic voice acting etc but not a big enough con overall i am pretty happy with how this game has turned out at launch i had played the previous betas of this game starting from the first one in late 2022 i had played that a lot 15 hours and only briefly tried the later betas my main issue with the betas was the performance happy to report that is all sorted and works very well even on my modest system now one thing i do feel is important to note here is that if you have played looter shooter games previously you are bound to enjoy and understand the game more i had a few hundred hours in warframe but i joined it in 2017 2018 always felt like starting at episode 586 of the world s longest soap opera here i felt more at home since i was here right from the beginning there are a lot of things borrowed and systems that work like warframe fast paced movement grappling farming missions quickly over and over to get drops etc there is a lot of grinding but its not as bad as some may say as for the repetitive nature of missions etc i feel that is once again something that is only an issue for people who don t like looter shooters or other games with a similar gameplay loop i even liked outriders so maybe that explains why i am liking this they also provide all the information for grinding and obtaining materials in the game may take a little time to fully understand but everything is available in game so overall i would recommend this game but keep in mind you have to like the looter shooter genre to enjoy this properly the only issue is probably some of the drop rates and prices for cosmetics etc i feel a little fine tuning there and it should be something the does well lets see how this game is a few months from now but player numbers are good and game is fun for now update after almost 400 hours still enjoying and still plan to play more a few things worth mentioning devs have been great so far 7 patches released so far since launch in less than 2 months they are listening to the feedback and improving things lots of improvements already which have helped reduce grind and made things a lot smoother there is a lot of comparison to warframe online from other reviews on yt makes sense but most of the comments are along the line of this is a poor clone of wf i am going back to wf i don t think this is meant to be a replacement to warframe i feel its for those who tried wf and did not like it because it was too vast and difficult to understand i had approx 250 hours and i barely understood how to do the basic things kept constantly asking friends about how to do certain things with tfd i am already making simple guides to help out people because its easier to understand i hope tfd does well long term and holds an active playerbase but if it doesn t that s ok too because i have thoroughly enjoyed my time with it so far and in this crowded market its done alright video review youtube video free to play the first descendant review after 50 hours views 1 378 i finished the main storyline completely free without spending anything is it good to play without paying timestamps 00 00 so i completed the story 00 25 10 million players and good steam numbers full guide on farming ultimate bunny for free youtube video how to unlock ultimate bunny full guide to farm efficiently the first descendant views 7 973 your full guide on how to properly farm ultimate bunny in the first descendant instead of paying 60 or 100 or mindlessly grinding for a week sharen build for outposts youtube video sharen build for outposts 20 seconds duration the first descendant views 5 376 simple sharen build for outposts that will give you 20 secs duration on your 2nd skill active camouflage which should make any outpost easy to hack
