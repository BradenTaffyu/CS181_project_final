2020 losing is fun try not to let negative reviews talking about forced pvp sway you away from this near masterpiece while the pvp can be frustrating it is some of the most dynamic and exciting pvp i ve come across in a long time blow them to bits with cannons repel boarders shoot yourself out of a cannon and board them drop their anchor steal their rowboat full of loot and slink away into the night yes the pvp is unavoidable at times but if you re paying attention to the horizon and keep situational awareness you can certainly diminish your player interactions or avoid it completely yes large crews prey on solo players yes you will lose your loot after gathering it yes you will have a total blast if you learn from the times you lost and turn that into victories i spent around 10 hours on a solo ship and the rest with friends public crews here s how it boils down solo incredibly atmospheric high tension and excitement public mixed bag generally pretty good but can be awful as well friends where this game shines sailing a galleon efficiently is a nightmare with 3 friends it s a breeze all in all it s utterly beautiful dynamic and fun pvp isn t going anywhere embrace it you will certainly lose but it gives you the best stories and really isn t writing your own sea shanty what this is all about
