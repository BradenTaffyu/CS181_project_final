2021 third time playing the game in 6 years but first time i actually got addicted to it it definitely improved immensely over the years not to mention tons of new content unlike other online games playing in public is mostly painless and doesn t require much communication so this is actually the first game i actively use public matchmaking when i m not with friends but friends are still important in keeping you invested in the game i started a tiny clan with a couple of friends and we ve all surprisingly stuck around for a couple of months now becoming a trader was probably the other half of what got me so attached to the game being able to make an insane amount of platinum opened a lot of avenues to get new weapons frames and mods all in all an amazing free to play game where the premium currency can easily be earned via trading and without spending a single cent
