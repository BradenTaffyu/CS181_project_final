2020 so there are people who played thousands of hours and now write negative reviews because there is not enough game or because the game is bad funny why did you play all this time if you didn t have fun if i would stop right now with 105 hours at the moment and not even near any kind endgame i would be completely happy with my playtime and all the fun i got from the game and it is even free with a fair monetization not pay to win youtube video fired for a retweet warframe cuts sponsorship for creator over political disagreement views 70 434 brands are only loyal to people who apparently agree with them politically too now it s not enough to shill their product you must be their political tool support the channel directly the devs try to listen to the community and communicate fairly openly about their plans it is a small developer and there are always bugs and some missteps but they always try to improve the game experience the game has even its own yearly convention and it has an unusually friendly community which is always willing to help new players this is needed since the game doesn t do a good job explaining all the different game systems so expect to read wiki articles watch youtube guides or ask questions if you want to dive into the min maxing game warframe is a 3rd person science fiction loot shooter with unsual setting ninjas in space and very unique atmosphere has its own distinctive art style and lots of interesting lore to uncover there are story quests and some of them are surprisingly good and there are lots of warframes weapons mods and builds to level and experiment with youtube video views 0 since it has years of content updates there is lots to do including randomly generated levels space combat open world areas clans housing pets vehicles and more it is most fun as coop experience but can also be played solo just don t expect pvp there are pvp modes in theory but nobody plays them lots of mission types but of course in the end everything boils down to grinding for ressources mods or blueprints to craft more stuff to grind more doing the same stuff over and over again if you don t like grind this is not for you graphics are good especially for a game released in 2013 texture resolution could be better but art style and lighting make it a very nice looking game and it has great music of course there could always be more variation in environments but what is here is more than you would expect especially later planets look faboulos warframe a screenshot of warframe by guthwulf the highlight is the gameplay itself it has a parcour system with very fluid and free movement the warframes and weapons all feel unique and the weapon handling is great combat feels responsive and satisfying there is also a big emphasis on melee combat simple hack slash besides shooting guns and using the special abilities of your warframes difficulty is low for most content you don t need the perfect build to get through the main content but there is a great flow to the gameplay so it still feels good personally i prefer warframe over games like destiny or borderlands the same way i prefer path of exile over diablo all in all give it a try it is free after all and has a great active community so you will always find people to play together with or get help if needed
