2017 when i got this game i thought i would get bored of it and go back to overwatch but almost 60 hours later into the game and its still fun and i have played 24 7 hours in two weeks i am still playing why becuase you have to play so tactical and think about where to go compare to call of duty just ran in like a idoit and get a 5 man headshot this game makes you think about that ever you do in the game might end up helping the team or up the team also all of the operators are different and unique with same being good at same points and others good at other points this game is better with friends like most team games if you scared of playing becuase people say you need friends and to them f u you can play on your own you can even meet people and then make a team it just up to you the player so i would recommend you buy this game if you what a game that will last you along time and hopefully i will see you defending the bomb
