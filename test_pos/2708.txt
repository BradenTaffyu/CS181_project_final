2018 gta v online or how i learnt to stop worrying and love the hackz0rs tl dr single player game isn t as good as gta iv only play online if you re going to cheat read on to find out why long read i started playing this game in october 2017 i d just got my sweet gaming rig after using apple for years due to work obligations at the time i read the negative reviews saying that players who didn t cheat were getting banned for cheating and everything was being taken away i scoffed they must have done something wrong that wouldn t happen to me as someone working full time i spent around 150 on shark cards to unlock missions and the stuff i wanted to do a sweet ride a nice motorbike harrier jet i tend to just log on now and again and drive about maybe do some hangar missions my guy is at level 20 i only have driving and flying skills maxed out all the other skills aren t even at level 3 3 million in the bank not really the account of a hacker fast forward to may 8th and my account has been banned it s a temp ban but my character is reset and everything i have bought will be taken away from me when the account comes back online in july furthermore if i keep infracting on the games tos it ll be a full ban next time this leads to somewhat of a conundrum obviously if i was a cheater i would know exactly what i had done wrong however as a 100 legitimate player i have no idea what i did or what warranted this ban indeed if you play legitimately then how can you play more legitimately in the future all attempts to contact support have ended in failure all bans are final is parroted back at me no one can tell me why i was banned this account then is ruined if i know i have done nothing wrong and as such don t know why the account was banned what could i possibly do to prevent a ban in the future especially if rockstar have simply closed the door on me when i ask for help and clarification researching some more into this recent ban wave to see if there are other honest players banned like me i discover that used accounts can be bought for as little as 5 in addition to that there are apparently many free mods and cheats out there that can go relatively undetected online and unlock everything apparently there are also paid for cheats i don t know how much these cost yet but one gamer i came across seems to maintain that he was banned because he used cheats he d paid for if he d stuck to the free ones he claims he probably would have been ok so for 5 you can have access to everything in gta v online as well as apparently more max all skills max all unlocks no wanted level infinite ammo etc from personally using shark cards it s my estimate that to unlock everything legitimately you d probably need to pay somewhere between 4000 5000 as you can see you can pay 4000 5000 and get everything and probably have your account banned or 5 get everything and most probably have your account banned but then after it s banned just spend another 5 again from this i can conclude that there is absolutely no reason to play this game legitimately there is a high probability you will be banned for no reason and have everything taken away with no chance to appeal or find out what happened if you use the cheats you will also probably be banned but you ll have access to everything and may have a lot more fun with all the added extras therefore i highly recommend this game but only if you re going to cheat if you want to play this game legitimately i would buy something else also fuck rockstar
