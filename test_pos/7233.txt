this game is being hold back from greatness by 2 things in my opinion first is optimization the game runs well in the wild with a few exception s of stuttering the moment you reach a city it just feels awful the cities are very good looking but because of the bad city optimization i just buy my item s and leave asap the second thing holding this game back is skill slot s the game play for the first 20 30 hours is fun but since you are stuck with only 4 skill slot s it can get repetitive after a while i thought unlocking the warfarer would make the game more fun but it sucks in general it went from jack of all trades to jack of some trades being limited to only 3 skills across the board so at the end of the day even if you are a fan of dragon s dogma i would wait a couple of weeks for bugs and optimization to be fixed before buying p s my most fun classes would be either thief or mystic spearhandp s s rip strider class i thought warfarer would have been able to do you justice but i was wrong
