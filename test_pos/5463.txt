2017 let me start off by saying that i used to despise ubisoft incosistent launches inconsistent implementations uplay as you can see on my profile i dont own much ubisoft games because most of them were either refunded or i requested to be deleted on my steam acc with that being said rainbow six is different it gives me a string of hope for ubisoft and it got me hooked to expect more from them now lets start with the game six siege is amazing and well optimized it s a game any fps player enthusiast should get it s a breath of fresh air for those who have been playing competitive fps games in our current fps market i can say that siege is one of the best coming from a guy who has played alot of shooter games series in the past cod quake insurgency l4d ow tf2 unreal h1z1 and cs now lets get into the game there are alot characters to choose from under the calling of operators these operators have their own speciality but the feel of the character is not very different from one another so i wouldn t call it classes the gameplay doesn t get bland overtime unlike most fps games today you can take a different approaches everytime you join in a new game the game provides you with enough customization with the attachments and it has camos but if you don t like those its optional you can play some singleplayer missions that are interesting and challenging if you re the type of gamer who looks for challenges the game has enough maps to not keep you bored and this is one of the main reasons why i fell in love with the game the maps are very good and well designed with the options given to you maps don t get repetitive because alot of entry options are given to you the way the gameplay pans out is very unique and different from most fps games today it s like cs swat cod campaign get the picture looks awesome yeah another thing possibly the best thing in this game the community the community is not toxic the community is great possibly one of the best communities i ve been introduced to for a while ubisoft and six siege are heading towards the right direction with its community i would like to encourage others to also join us in that direction
