2018 you know when you are bored so you decide to write an in depth review about one of you re favrouite games well here it is bare in mind that this review is aimed for new players starting out intro tom clancy s rainbow six siege is a tactical first person shooter where it excels in intense 5v5 highly competitive close quarter combat rainbow six siege or r6s is one of the most inovative first person shooters focusing highly on teamwork to gather information and take out your foes operators in r6s players will have a choice of operators to pick from before a match starts these operators have to be unlocked through in game currency called renown that is earned by completing matches completing terrorist hunt missions and finally by successfully completing challenges that are given daily in game as well as weekly in the uplay overlay anyway depending on the edition of the game you bought you will start of with some default operators usually easy to use for begginers every operator in the game has its own unique special ability or main gadget these gadgets in the right hands can aid you and you re team to victory ubisoft done a great job adding personality into these characters all which have their own voice actors and quotes in game all of the operators come from well know counter terrorist units that are active around the globe ctus such as the sas gign and fbi swat and many more are all featured in this game the devs are always coming up with new operators and they always surprise me with what the release in terms of new gadgets attack the attackers in r6s must work together to secure an objective that is situated inside a building when the match begins attackers will have some time to prepare the attack by scouting the area using remote controlled drones that can be used to relay intel to you teamates by spotting enemies and finding the objective attackers may use their drones as much as they like as long as they have not been destroyed by the defenders when the preperation phase has finished the attacking team will now be able to enter the building and fight their way to the objective every attacking operator can scale the map by rapelling up and down to get better angles or reach a roof balcony finally attackers have exclusive equipment that can also help them to secure objectives such as claymores to watch you re back smoke granades to cover lines of sights and frag flash granades to flush out defenders in the objective defend defening in r6s is always different many maps have their own characteristics and defenders must adapt to defend specific rooms while the attackers are droning in preperation phase defenders have to fortifiy their position by reinforcing walls that can be breached and destroying attackers drones to prevent them from gathering intel when playing as a defender in r6s players may conjure different playstyles roaming where a player will run around the map trying to harras attackers before they make their way to the objective or just simply holding you re ground in the objective room and watching angles this all depends on what operators have been picked furthermore defenders are also have exclusive equipment that can can be deployed a deployable shield can be placed in doorway to force enemies to vault over and reducing their accuracy slightly or they can be used for mobile cover barbed wire is a excellent choice to gather information through sound and to also slow down the attackers c4 or nitro cells can be used to blow up you re oponents remotely it can be stuck to surfaces to blow up walls and ceilings too finally defenders have access to impact granades which instantly explode when they make contact with a player or wall they are usually used to create rotation holes in and around the objective maps environment r6s has a vast selection of maps where different tactics are required a typical map will consist of three floors basement b first floor f1 and second floor f2 each map contains destructible walls that can be destroyed and penetrated by both teams higher caliber weapons will siginficantly increase the damage to a given surface shotguns are a great choice to quickly open up hatches or holes in the wall every season a new map is added and it reflects the new operators that come with it for example with the new operators being spanish the new map will be featured in spain gamemodes there are only three gamemodes in r6s secure area where attackers must access a specific room and hold it for a certain amount of time defenders can contest the objective if they are together with the enemy its very similar to hardpoint from other games if you wish but it stays in one place hostage where the defenders must prevent the attacking team to capture the hostage and extract it outside the map if the hostage is killed by an attacker the defenders win the round but if a defenders decide to execute the hostage for any reason then the atacking team will win the round finally we have bomb where one attacker is equiped with a diffuser that is needed to diffuse one of the two chemical bombs that the defenders are protecting when the diffuser is planted defenders must act quickly to destroy the diffusing device by approching it and holding the interact button attackers will win if the diffuser completes its job or all the defenders are dead community this is in time of writing the 4th most played game on steam the r6s community is a mixed bag so to say i personally came accross amazing teammates which i have become good friends with online there are a lot of friendly players that you will come across that will communicate with you and praise you for doing the same and playing well however you will also encounter trolls and toxic players in this game but ubisoft s anti cheat battleye is constantly banning toxic players that have been reported for toxic behaviour such as intentional teamkilling and constant use of homphobic slurs and racism in chat if you encounter those people just igonre and report them they will almost guaranteed to be banned since the devs have took toxicity seriously in this game recently cons although the game is very well optimised it suffers from hit registration problems where headshots are key in this game as they will instantly kill you players like myself have become quite frustrated when you land a headshot and it just does not connect in some cases you can hit an enemy see blood come out but they will take no damage you will know this becaue when they kill you the kill cam will display the killers health however ubisoft is working hard and they are implementing a better system to help with sight missalignment to provide the best hit reg moreover there are some minor bugs when it comes to the ragdoll physics of the game some dead bodies may spaz out and have their arms or legs elongated although its not gamebreaking most of the significant glitches that players exploited have been fixed such as the shield operator no recoil glitch that was found by accident conclusion to summarise i would higly recommend tom clancy s rainbow six siege to all fps lovers take your time to learn the maps and operators there are lots of guides out there and videos that explain how to play as each operator this game is absolutely amazing when played with friends so don t be shy to make some in game bartozy
