2017 simply amazing tactical shooter that takes a completely new approach to the genre attackers start by gathering intel you don t even know where the objective is to start so gathering intel on that the classes of your enemies so you can better prepare location of their traps etc meanwhile defenders start by laying traps and reinforcing walls since the environmental destruction is absolutely large scale while they already have default cameras set up there s also another class which can set up a few more cameras drones and cameras are able to be viewed by everyone on the team so intel for both sides is vitally important and the reason why you just died from a shot through the wall each operator is its own class with a completely separate set of things that it needs to do to attain victory also be very careful as friendly fire is a thing and killing the objective hostage results in insta lose and another thing is that even after death you still are vitally important to your team you re able to view all cameras and control their sight and call out enemies either through voice or with the in game pinger there s so much that sets this game apart from traditional tactical shooters but in all the right directions definitely give this game a shot it s absolutely amazing
