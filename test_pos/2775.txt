video game 800 milion views graphics1 graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible the game runs smooth on any kind of gpu s and cpu s as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements by the way these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details 2 graphic details are the best i have seen especially in an open world game if i was to tell you all about this topic i would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours because boy there are lots to talk about i m just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me a day night cycle recreation sure this is not something new in its essence it has been done before and not just in gta but the way we see it here it s what s amazing the way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it s off the charts you don t even realize when the afternoon becomes evening the only way you can tell it s that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you b rain again not a new feature actually is quite an old one but the way it s been reproduced in gtav you can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact apart from the obvious what makes rain so special in gtav well the sound this is something that not many people talk about yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game the way rockstar games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain besides everything else c night time baby sure we had night in gta iv and even before that so why do i mention this well because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows i am not talking just about the graphics aspect what i m saying is that the night in gtav gives you the impression of actual liveliness the whole city comes to life it s just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever 3 cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we ve seen in previous gta s i m not talking about a direct comparison because of the obvious reason 2015 2010 but what i m trying to say is that i personally wasn t that impressed at the time by the cars helis planes in gta4 as i am now in gtav gameplay and featuresoh yea the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for gtav to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come 1 car control i feel like thanking rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter car control was preety much garbage in gta iv and for this reason alone i had no big expectations for this new series well i was wrong the car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing nfs mw back in the day besides the control there is the sound of the car s engine which is perfectly accurate 2 randomness now what in god s name i m talking about well have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help a woman s that was about to get raped a kid who s bike was stolen hitchhiker asking you to take her him home etc usually for a reward if you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal but baby this stuff gives gtav a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game 3 los santos customs again not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special have you tried modifying the car s suspension of course you did what am i saying but have you actually paid attention of it s realism after the change was made well for those who haven t and for the one s who dont own the game yet let me tell you that this feature is game making my favorite car in gtav is the grotti carbonizzare also known as the ferarri f12 now think how am i gonna drive that beast on the city s roads especially in areas like groove hilwood rockford these are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads so you cant really drive a ferarri in these parts of the town well you can modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn t just make for visual effects but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads turns hard turns btw if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings for me this is one of the best things i ve seen in this game 4 activities driving mission making robberies flying hunting diving piloting aircrafts submarines boats golf tennis cards smoke weed racing playing the stock market you will never get bored in this game not even in single player mode there are so many more things to talk about but the review would be monstruosly long so in a few words buy the game it will be the best investment you have done in a pc game for those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom i can tell you in short that this game excels in every aspect weapons look so realistic in first person mode cars have a mind blowing realistic control weather has never been better reproduced etc gl hf
