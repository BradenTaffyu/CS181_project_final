2022 just finished a cathay campaign two strong impressions 1 siege battles feel much more fun because of the new multi layer settlements maps and supply mechanic to build defense structures 2 quest battles are also very enjoyable having to capture multiple victory points and hold them against enemies waves meanwhile you have supply points to build defense structure call in reinforcements and buff heal units mid battle downside is that these battles are quite long now the new siege battles are definitely more fun than before if you are defending you can build defense structures like towers traps and barricades and the new settlements map are huge and complex with multi layer pathways and many interesting choke points this opens up many interesting strategies to turn defeats into heroic victories i was able to win many outnumbered defense battles by holding crucial choke points and maneuver my army through multiple lines of defenses to wear enemies down cathay crossbows felt so strong when you have them positioned on higher grounds and having your melee units hold the enemies down the downsides are these battles are sometimes very long because of how big the new maps are and attackers do feel harder to play if you don t take supply point the defenders can constantly build towers traps and etc the quest battles are also more interesting now you have to capture several locations sequentially and after each capture you have 45 sec to build defenses and layout your army against a coming enemy wave these battles are super fun because you need to play as both attacker and defender you capture points from enemies and then defend them against them who are trying to take them back you can also call in reinforcements heal restock or buff your units mid battle using supply points which are passively generated the maps are also huge with interesting terrains and choke points where you can leverage to either hold points or push through enemy defenses the final battle also have interesting mechanics xd annoying or fun very subjective 1 constant spawning of enemy troops behind you after taking first points forcing you to take next victory point quickly while hold up against enemies chasing behind you 2 random enemy teleport onto final victory point soulgrinders into the middle of your army this scared me so hard since these giant nonstoppable monstrous machines just started spawning and running through my crossbows at the end downside is still the same the battles can feel long easily 30 min as for optimization i honestly feel it is similar to total war warhammer ii occasional fps drops especially on the campaign i did not experience anything major that stopped me from playing it the only bug i encounter was that a few of the rifts i closed somehow reopened after i reloaded the save file the next day i was able to enjoying the game and i don t really expect any more optimization improvement as long as it runs fine as warhammer ii and whenever mortal empire whatever you call it the aggregation of warhammer i ii iii come out the game still runs the same i am totally fine with the current state of optimization
