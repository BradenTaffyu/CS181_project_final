2020 apex legends is a great battle royale it brings a unique spin with characters having different abilities every match feels like a different experience its world building is amazing you want to know more about these characters and the world around them they have been testing a lot of modes to the game they all bring a breath of fresh air every time the battlepasses are getting better they bring stuff the players want one con to the game is the price of the skins and items is ridiculous they really want you to pay up but an overall fun game collapse
