2023 i cannot believe this game is turning 10 years old even if you dislike open world games even if you prefer another gta title over this one and despite the pit that is gta online and the downright disgusting and disrespectful treatment towards fans and modders from take two interactive there is no denying just how special grand theft auto v is this absolute beast of a game in single player still feels like the most rich beautiful and entertaining open world game ever made even after having finished it on all 7th and 8th gen consoles and pc from excitedly coming home from school on september 17th 2013 to a freshly collected pre order for the xbox 360 to reluctantly buying this game a fifth time on steam in 2023 every playthrough feels like a fresh experience whether it be the order in which i tackle main and side missions a new detail i never noticed previously a random event i don t recall or never discovered switching up my approach to a heist a radio song making action in the moment more impactful or just finding a new way to make my own fun out in free roam gta v is a timeless masterpiece and i think i ll be revisiting even another decade down the line even if gta vi tops it bravo rockstar games thank you
