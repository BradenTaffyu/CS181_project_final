2017 early access review lots of contents for your desktop backgrounds some clock and calendar widgets that are blended into the wallpaper uses very little system resource to run easy to use interface and upload large files without much hassle upload scene video web and application wallpaper need more uploads from games and other media currently 4 2017 too many anime contents 3d girls dancing your typical ones flooding the library the gui feels like it s bland a bit more upgrade on its apperance along with new options would make it appear more polished tried to run it while playing another game caused the in game sound music from game to be muted could not hear the background s music or the game s music turning off the background s setting for audio did nothing for the game perhaps i am not suppose to run this while playing a game but if that is the case correct me if i am wrong then the point of having it for setting up live wallpaper would mean nothing overall it s an amazing piece of software small flexible for further development lots of contents and a very cheap price tag means there is more to gain than loose from it worth having in your library
