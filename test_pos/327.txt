2017 rating good 7 10 introduction counter strike global offensive is a first person shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective it is a stand alone follow up to the famous counter strike mod from half life where terrorists battle the counter terrorists on different locations gameplay story 6 10 the gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents easier said than done actually since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some ai programmed to shoot you first cs go is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years since it offers great weapon balance tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day the story behind the game is based on the oldschool counter strike game where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being counter terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at terrorist base combat challenge 8 10 the combat is absolutely fluid in cs go and there are barely any moments that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying people tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps weapons or programming of the game however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market the challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french i am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if i did not win the match no matter the team stacks reaching global elite rank after around 200 hours i can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you graphic interface 7 10 the graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable like certain grapphiti on some maps the interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration progress mini games 8 10 it is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing cs go in any form there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market so different ways to progress in and outside of the game the biggest progress for me was improving my hand to eye coordination by playing it competetively audio immersion 8 10 each weapon sound is unique for itself and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from cs go fulfills its task really well the music is played only in menues and during the highlights the game music is nothing special but since you can get buy music kits to fit your music taste valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves side notes this game offers single player multiplayer and co op modes that can be played either against other players or ai this game offers different modes some of that are just for fun for example gun mode while others are played in e sports this game contains steam achievements this game offers great optimization and updates to technology with time updating their network code updating the hit boxes balancing the weapons summary cs go has its reasons to be the number one fps in the esl scene and its popularity is currently only rising it is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state but still keeps getting updated i would recommend trying cs go to every game just to know what this game is that defines the global fps market so much and while fps fans might love it some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna bes i hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it forestwolf
