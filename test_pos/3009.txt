2022 the game is almost 10 years old but i just played it for the first time considering how delighted i was discovering gtaiv details physics lightning i was already sitting down to v with a certain standard in my head i perfectly remember a similar feeling when i sat down to vc after iii style and feelings grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by lux i won t elaborate the game tastes like a really well cooked spiced dish served just the way i wanted it but damn i didn t define it before i remember a scene from the movie coffee and cigarettes watch the lady is sitting in a pub drinking coffee the way she likes it the waiter comes up supposedly asking whether to refill but without waiting for an answer he pours more annoyed she points out to him that she already had the perfect color and temperature and it was great the coffee now was the physics in gta iv better yes it was i noticed but was it that much better wink not until i looked at those videos like why gtaiv is better than v are missions in v absurd and unrealistic because that s what i was told strangely enough no there are some unusual ones but nowhere near the level of san andreas is the plot worse incoherent no because this game is one big sandbox in which the creators skillfully entwined a lot of allusions the plot isn t like one signature christmas dish like in vc or iv it s like a great feast buffet where i leave full and having tasted everything and at the end someone next to me asked have you tried this works for me in iii and iv i missed wild extra urban areas so i liked playing mafia for instance however i will never forget the first time in sa i drove from san fierro to las venturas through those desert hills in bone country i felt the same when i jumped in trevor s shoes for the first time the difference between the possibilities in vc and sa was huge in the latter the latter there was too much of everything and it was overwhelming here it s fine lots of mini games golf tennis yoga etc enough clothes plus jet ski planes car tuning i am filled not overfed characters and plot heat 1995 community created artwork for grand theft auto v by lux vincent hanna which one s slick interestingly i ve managed to avoid spoilers over the years i knew that the game bows to movies among others heat 1995 but i didn t know it was that much i dressed the characters in the screen above on purpose because they are waingro donald breedan and neil mccauley respectively michaelmichael started out as my favorite character and ended up being the most irritating and a bit grossed out his attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the a final surviving is winning franklin everything else is fairy tales spun by people too afraid to look life in the eye whatever it takes kid survive keyword survival trevorwhen trevor killed john in the beginning i thought it was an exaggerated attempt to show how dangerous and unpredictable he is but since then he s only gotten better definitely the most coherent and deep character despite the apparent madness his attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the b final well i can t you re turning on him i ve had enough traitors in my life keyword authenticity franklinfranklin franklin everything and nothing fun and boredom i enjoyed playing it the least but ended up losing the most hours with him because he is practical he has the most useful skill funny dialogue a bit like beating the fourth wall in style the least interesting character from the viewer point of view but the most necessary from the player point of view keyword i don t know maybe the fourth wall gameplayi like immersing in the presented world the most and with the enormity and variety of ls and blaine country and the possibility of playing from the fpp view gtav is a great pleasure grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by lux random encounters are surprising the biggest wtf i had was when i met two old men on the road trying to rape a girl i laughed when i picked up a drunk couple and they started banging in the back of the car definitely an adult game i reminded myself when i saw the short film the loneliest robot in great britain at the cinema i would love to release a series in which i play without radar hud in fpp and roleplay the only thing missing is the physics from iv on the other hand it s gta after all and you can really have fun with v post scriptumi forgot about the muuusic countless stations i didn t have time to listen to everything yet but the absolute number 1 is the track when we pause the game listen my gallery on steam story world 10 video 10 audio 9 gameplay 10 overall 10
