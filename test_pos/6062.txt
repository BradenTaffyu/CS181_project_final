2017 have you ever wanted to play a terrifying game where you are stranded in a remote location being chased by a psychopathic killer with nothing but you your whit and 3 other people to accompany you well that sucks but let me welcome you to running circles simulator this great game will allow you to run in circles for whole minutes being chased by a walking salt bucket who will probably eventually down you and put you on a hook for all to see then he will stand right next to you until you evaporate into nothingness while your teammates run around and use their mechanical engineering degrees to work on v8 engines scattered across the map so that some door switch can be activated or something dont forget to stay after your dead for the post game salted spews of cancer coming from your enemy and your teammates 8 8 would run circles again
