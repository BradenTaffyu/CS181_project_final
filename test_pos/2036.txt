in my perspective as a competitive gamer this is my first time playing this kind of battle royale game at first i thought the game would be non beginner friendly but the game allows you to level up in bots mode there are three different difficulty too and also you can level up battle pass in the bot mode my first 5 hours was fun until i realize without the game basic mechanics bot easy could defeat me with simple computerized combos there are so many people in the community that answers to my question even some youtube channels are really specific for helping new players the next 20 hours i start to figured it out that the game has so many combos to learn but with only one or two basic combos that you can do consistently is already enough to be good at the first 100 hours after my first 50 hours i believe that bot mode doesn t really give me any improvement anymore and starting to play quick match the game was fun the community is insanely great no toxic all people are helpful even with the pve too the game is worth it it is free there are sea server the cosmetic are great battlepass is cashback too i can wait for the next 200 hours i really focusing on katana heng and dual halberds for now to become great great
