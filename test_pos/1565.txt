2022 let me start by saying the game is good if you buy this game you most likely will enjoy your first campaign if you enjoyed your first vortex campaign from game 2 they have added a bunch of qol improvements and changes that i find pleasing the negative reviews are due to a few things which are legitimate like the bugs the lack of replayability and comparisons of this brand new game to the masterpiece that was the second game of the trilogy i felt the need to leave this review to give greater context to the negative reviews people are comparing this brand new game to game 2 which has had years of tweaks and dlc to flesh it out to it s greatest potential game 3 is brand new no dlc other than the day 1 pre order bonus no mortal empires fresh bugs etc it is a bit unfair to compared game 3 at launch to game 2 at it s peak game 2 at launch did not have mortal empires and only had a fraction of the playable races lords available as they do now in time game 3 will likely surpass the popularity of 2 but it will take time for the devs to add in immortal empires sandbox mode new lords factions and patch bugs i do think this game was the best of the 3 on release day but wh2 with all the dlc and updates is currently the superior product unless you ve played it to death and are bored of playing the warhammer games rarely ever go on sale so i would suggest picking it up and enjoying a campaign or two now and when you get bored put it down until they come out with new updates especially the immortal empires update which is coming later this year that should add a bunch of replayability that currently isn t here for a lot of people who dislike the souls race and don t feel like installing any mods to remove that objective from the game the current factions already offer up a bunch of differing campaign mechanics to keep things fresh for me personally but your mileage may vary this game gets two thumbs up from me because i know it will get better over time like the first and second games did and i had fun with what they released on day 1
