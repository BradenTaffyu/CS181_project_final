2021 mainly survivor long story short this game is good and i recommend it pros really fun with friends quite frequent updates perfect for people who like assymetrical horror games not so bad graphics balanced variety of gameplay perks abilities addons etc change the game cons lots of bugs both only visual and game breaking really toxic community not all perks are playable meta exists survivor soloq example how soloq looks if you want to play as a survivor please do yourself a favour and find some friends at least 1 to play with solo queue is hell if you get good as a survivor you can theoretically run the killer whole game but note you have no teammates you ran the killer for 3 minutes quite a lot but only 1 generator was done because claudette was hiding in the corner and doing absolutely nothing cause why would she then there is this dwight look at him he is doing a gen but every time you get closer to him with the killer behind you he gets scared and hides of course the killer eventually gets you and you end up on hook and where is the third teammate you might ask well of course they disconnected after killer hit them at the begininning of the match brilliant oh look there comes the claudette to save you but the killer is right behind her oh no she got hit but she doesn t care she wants to save you after all you are already in second stage because dwight is doing gens claud unhooks you and gets downed believe me this is the better scenario of course she had no borrowed time so you get downed instantly killer waits ds and then you are dead the end
