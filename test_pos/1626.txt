2022 if this was my first total war warhammer title i would probably give it a thumbs down for the time being albeit it would be close however i know that performance improvements will come and i know that mortal empires will transform this into a masterpiece eventually lots of caveats but i love the idea of where i know this game to be heading and trust in the team enough to get there because they did with tw wh 1 2 currently this game is beautiful runs like even on high end rigs and feels like you are rushed through a specific strategy of essentially teching up and turtling i just so happen to prefer this strat so i m biased but rapid expansion is heavily penalized currently the factions are super interesting in their own ways and i can t wait for the mortal empires dlc combining this with the other two maps into a colossal campaign sandbox with endless replayability tldr game is in an unfinished state but their trackrecord of making the necessary improvements post release make this a thumbs up for me
