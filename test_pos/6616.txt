product received for free after getting all the achievements i can finally write a review the game is a 3rd person hero looter shooter with a grappling hook somewhat similar to the just cause series the game can be finished without spending a single dime although it does become a bit grindy additionally there is no dei stuff in the game and they are adding a lot of fan service skins finally a game developer that is listening to the audience who are playing the game and not to the twitter warriors
