2022 introductionelden ring is a souls like action rpg by the legendary fromsoftware the developers of the dark souls series where the main goal is to expand the genre by allowing you full access to an open world environment players will have treacherous traps to bypass devious bosses to decimate and epic distances to travel on their path to becoming an elden lord positives negatives classic souls formula where combat prowess determines your progression large selection of weapons and armour the sheer scope of the open world is overwhelming a well written and captivating storyline new crafting mechanic is intuitive and easy to use all damage types and builds are viable a truly terrible launch where many bugs and issues still exist in the game there is no tangible balance between different builds mechanically boring boss encounters an abhorrent amount of recycled content especially in the latter half of the game unannounced patches fixes completely break builds this forces you to either farm levels to make up the gap or re assign attribute points at your own cost to fix it storyin elden ring you assume the role of a warrior derogatorily known as a tarnished a being whose existence is an affront in this land where gold and power rule all you soon find out that this world has been torn apart by countless wars and that very little of its once noble kingdoms remain you must use sites of grace elden ring s bonfire replacement to guide you across these lands and seek out the great rune bearers with the hope that you can eventually restore the elden ring itself and assume the mantle of elden lord but this is no simple task as over time these great beings have become lost and confused in a power fuelled madness and they will do anything to ensure the runes remain in their grasp elden ring s story is mostly masked in fog and intrigue and to truly understand it in its entirety you will likely need several playthroughs and to explore every inch of its world to unravel it what is explained to you however is beautifully written and flows exceptionally well for the entirety of the game such a grand cinematic fight a screenshot of elden ring by preator gameplay analysisa world where power is taken not giventhe heart of all souls like games is inevitably the combat where prowess and skill determine whether you are victorious or suffer a crushing defeat elden ring is the same for the most part combat is more forgiving than previous fromsoftware entries especially compared to their previous title sekiro where even minor mistakes could cost you a dozen hours despite its fairer scenarios you will still require some finesse to progress combat is smooth and for the most part pretty fair although there are some cases where it can feel clunky or just plain broken you have far more freedom here to build your character exactly how you want to with limited respec s available to your character as well as a plethora of weapons and armour to choose from combine all of this with both the new and improved ashes system where you can enchant a non unique weapon with a specific skill and a completely rebalanced magic and ranged system you have a fairly dynamic gameplay experience there is also a newly implemented crafting mechanic while i didn t use it to its full potential i can see it being useful to the player who wants an edge for boss fights or difficult encounters most crafting materials are freely available in either the open world or as drops from specific enemies like butter spread too thin on toast this is the best analogy i can give to the game s open world experience in truth the scope feels extraordinary with every visible location in the distance being a place worth investigating it saddens me that this falls short of expectation as the game s format doesn t fit this kind of experience it feels like a flattened and rolled out version of the original dark souls formula without updating it all to compensate for the vast distances this is made more evident in the latter portion of the game where it s riddled with recycled content bosses and enemies you have already fought will return to the fray with slightly more health or a higher damage output which honestly is just lazy game design and it entirely detracts from the atmosphere intended there can be no victory if the war was lost to begin with veterans of the genre will be glad to see the vast quantity of bosses and enemies this game has to offer from monstrous dragons to overwhelming giants this game has it all so it disappoints me greatly to play through the entire campaign completely unimpressed by the lack of boss mechanics tactics and overall strategy there are obviously exceptions to the rule but the overall experience fighting most of them felt uninteresting and stale the side content isn t much better where you are literally just riding around looking for copy paste dungeons or crafting materials to bolster you against the next boss fight audio and visualthere can be no denying this game is stunning a real treat for the eyes in nearly every aspect of its design the world is gorgeous the vistas are cinematic and the bosses are heavily detailed in a way telling you a story about themselves by just standing before you my only major concern is the sheer amount of golden visuals that encompass your vision no matter where you look one of the many beautiful vistas in the game a screenshot of elden ring by preator the audio falls into the same boat with most of it being recycled from previous games it immediately feels a little stale there is a notion of nostalgia here for sure but i think an entirely fresh experience would have done wonders to contrast this perfectly the soundtrack is just something to behold absolutely one of my favourite soundtracks ever orchestrated with each boss and zone bringing entirely new compositions to the fold and elevating the overall atmosphere pc performance and specificationswith settings set as high as they could go i ve had only minor fluctuations in frame rates with my current build below game launch had an astronomical amount of issues some of which were heavily performance based most of these have since been rectified volumes of bugs and crashes experienced in under 100 hours of gameplay some texture tearing and clipping issues were present ram 32gb under load usage 39 cpu i9 10900ka 3 70ghz under load usage 42 gpu msi ventus rtx 3080 under load usage 49 4 final thoughts very goodreview chart here elden ring is a well written and gorgeous adventure that also proves without a shadow of a doubt that you can t simply take an existing linear formula and force it into a new open world shape without it losing some integrity a vast array of new and improved mechanics as well as the large catalogue of weapons and armours you can choose from basically ensures that no challenge is insurmountable and will keep you build crafting for many hours there were quite a lot of bugs and performance issues at launch but these have been rectified for the most part overall a decent game and one that definitely caters to a larger audience than ever before i can recommend this game in its current state but if you havent been a fan of the genre in the past perhaps wait for a sale follow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality reviews regularly
