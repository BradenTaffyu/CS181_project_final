2022 it s a fun game but it has issues most notably for me once you get to platinum rank or above solo queue it seems like everyone just uses daggers and nunchucks reason being they re spammy and almost impossible to react to if you know how to abuse them which makes sense why they re used but i feel like it s bad game design to have such cheap weapons in the game all of the other weapons have obvious counterplay and seem mostly balanced it s also dead in the west so expect games full of bots until you get to platinum rank or above
