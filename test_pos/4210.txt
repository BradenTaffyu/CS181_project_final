2023 product received for free the best mmo i may never play again originally i played this game on the xbox it was a fun ninja game where i got to flip around and zap people then i invited my friend to play with me i ll call him j at first my goal was simply to get him to download the game get bored and then leave so i could trade his starter platinum i know it doesn t work now and use it on a cape or something i don t remember but j loved this game in fact he used that platinum and bought loki back then he cost as much platinum as the starter trio so on half price he was less than 50 plat j played the game religiously he looked up the wiki made friends online and very quickly surpassed me in every regard i may have introduced him to the game but i was learning more from him than i would have likely ever learnt myself j gave me a reason to play i hate mmo s the grind kills me inside and i can t stand playing a game for more than 100 hours unless it really grasps me so when i say that including my hours on the xbox i have almost 1000 total you can get an idea of how much i loved this game because of j i learned to love the game even though i hated its grind and i kept coming back every time every update he taught me something new when j took a break i moved onto playing it on pc with other friends and i without realising sank another 200 hours into it i had a great time with warframe and occasionally id play back on xbox or pc but it was losing its charm for me the grind not as appealing as it was before the last update i played was the one that added roomba s for your ship and i haven t really touched the game since but its not just because of losing enjoyment j passed away towards the end of last year this game holds so many great memories of him and our time spent together on it and i don t want to leave it behind because of that but i also cant quite bring myself to play it and i m writing this review because while staring at the page it asked me if i recommend this game to other people yes warframe is a fantastic free to play game that gives you a unique experience like no other i ve played you don t have to spend money you don t have to devote 1000 hours to it but you just may get yourself a friend to play this with trust me you will enjoy your time with it a lot lore than you may otherwise i think i will keep playing warframe both for fun and in honour of my lost friend and i very much suggest that you do too thank youedit since this review i found my passion for this game once more and have sunk an extra 300 hours into it play warframe its a fantastic game
