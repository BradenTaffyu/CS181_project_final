i love the game it looks amazing the people are nice but you can run into some unfriendly people too i like the fact that the game has very good tutorial it s not easy to manage every thing wen you are alone but i will get used to it it s really fun even if you play by your self but if you have friends it is even more enjoyable if you see me in the sea of thieves know that i am friendly if you don t attack me i won t attack you
