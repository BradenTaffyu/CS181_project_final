2022 soulslike done rightif anyone is going to do a soulslike and do it right it may as well be the folks responsible for demon s souls and dark souls much like demon s souls connection to dark souls elden ring is not a continuation of either series yet the game borrows a lot of elements all the same from combat to the overall tone and look while adding in its own unique flair to make it still seem like something original with new enemies a new story and a completely new way to explore this massive new world a whole new worldelden ring takes place in a world called the lands between a really big world brimming with both life and death at every corner i won t go into story really to give away any spoilers but rather say where dark souls is overly dark and dreary a lot of elden ring feels sort of the opposite full of light and wonderment that is not to say though that a bit of elden ring will not bring you the same dark morbid uneasiness found in a dark souls game oh it will but you will also find areas lush with life and i mean wildlife too this is a world that seems to have a mixture of both hope and dread at the same time one minute you ll be in a magical forest with twinkling lights and cute and fuzzy critters and beautiful floral scenery and the next you might find yourself in a dark gothic hellish landscape with half rotted corpses crumbling buildings and doom at every corner it s wonderful how well elden ring connects these themes in its world filled with massive castles poisonous swamps huge open battlefields mystical forests and more it would be hard to explore everything in one playthrough given how many nooks and crannies are scattered about there are tons of dungeons hidden bosses secret areas and some avenues completely locked off unless you meet certain quest requirements but as big as the world is and as non linear the path is you ll be hard pressed to find yourself not finding some new discovery each time you boot the game up i m personally at around 100 hours so far and still plenty to discover and am still finding new things on current plays even revisiting old areas i thought i fully explored before since elden ring is as big as it is the game does include a map which at first will reveal itself to be rather small despite the opening area being so massive as you explore more areas the map will grow in size and each site of grace essentially the new bonfires will allow for fast travel between them one thing elden ring does not do like you find in most open world games is hold your hand when it comes to quest progression most open world games usually have a logbook with all of your quests elden ring does not it does not usually point you in the right direction on side quests other than through conversations with npcs or treasure maps it s up to you to figure out where to go that said though the sites of grace usually clue you in on where to go for the bigger picture being the main quest but it s not so fun to just focus on those directions the game offers so much more that you will find it more enjoyable to go off the beaten path and do your own thing combat evolvedthis is one the areas where elden ring is going to feel the most familiar combat you have most of the same mechanics introduced in demon s and dark souls with only a few omissions but some new tricks added to take the place of those combat varies based on your left and right hand load out where your right hand is usually the dominant for weapons the usual layout would be a weapon in the right hand and some type of shield in the left but you can mix things up any way you want and a lot of the weapons even allow for dual fisting for different and sometimes more powerful attacks at the expense of less defense you can also equip ranged weapons such as bows and cannons yes cannons and also magical staffs and amulets for a wide variety of attacks buffs heals and more of course much like previous souls games the items you wield come at a cost which is based on the stats you have so managing how you spend your skill allotment with each level gained is crucial luckily later in the game you can respec in case you have any regrets but these skills mixed with the loadout you use can make for a wide variety of playstyles if you want to be a pure bruiser you can if you wish to play a more stealthy ranged attacker you can if you want to play an all powerful battlemage you can do that too while you are given a limited number of themed starting characters ultimately you can switch it up to any playstyle you wish as you progress some of the new things added to elden ring for combat really make for a much more interesting dynamic for starters you can now crouch this allows you to add in a sense of stealth which is perfect for things like backstabs or just to survey an unfamiliar room you can also jump well technically you could jump in dark souls but it was a little convoluted and mostly ended up being used for navigating and not so much in combat in elden ring you have an actual dedicated jump button that you can mix with attacks to get an aerial advantage a great maneuver for catching enemies off guard on top of all of this a majority of the game s open world will be playable on horseback and with your trusty steed torrent you will also be able to have attacks while mounted there are a lot of different ways to utilize the combat something for everyone so when you feel one approach might he too difficult you might want to take a step back and figure out a different approach luckily elden ring has you covered on options it s not dark souls it s so much better elden ring may feel unforgiving at first for those not familiar with from software s other works mainly dark souls first hand but for those who are this will be a delight to put it bluntly this is not dark souls but at the same time this is best experienced if you know dark souls the dna of the dark souls franchise is baked into elden ring in a way that will make it familiar and wholly accessible to fans of the series while still giving you a completely fresh and original experience while this may not be dark souls it is safe to say this is something better this review is a work in progress
