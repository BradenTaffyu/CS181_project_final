2020 honest review from the mind of a simple critic industrial gamers gameplay sea of thieves is about as free form of an experience as you can get which is both a blessing and a curse on the one hand you could probably spend close to a dozen hours having fun sailing around without ever realizing there is a proper campaign to follow like i did and that s when i discovered that even though its free roaming gameplay is enjoyable enough once i realized what these missions called tall tales were and how to access them they led to some of my favorite moments graphics can be either beautiful or deadly under the circumstances a balanced mixture of ever changing waves and heavenly sunsets or cruel storms and destructive volcanoes a game that truly immerses the player in a vibrant world controls easy to pick up but don t be like me and pick out your banana instead of your pistol in a fight sound rough seas 24 7 and the occasional boat crunch when you drop your anchor too close to the shore love it difficulty the game offers very little in difficulty when you play with a crew the difficulty rises significantly when you try to solo a sloop solo means heightened awareness of all surroundings sea and land solo means if you gather enough treasure you welcome unwanted eyes from npc s and players alike and lastly solo means if you are chased by preying eyes and damaged you will have to act as both repairman and captain of the guns which is in my opinion no easy feat final rating even though the game offers purely cosmetic items for everything you unlock i still enjoyed having fun with friends and being shocked by the unpredictable settings that the game sets you in i for one will always recommend this game because it is downright fun to play
