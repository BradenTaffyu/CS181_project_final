i really love this game as much as the first one the gameplay is really good the pawn system unique and the story was okey not that amazing but i really hope they will add a expansion in the future like dark arisen so far i guess i ve been lucky i only had two crash in 150h the performance for me its been good exept a bit vernworth when there is a lot of npc but its the only thing i could complain about they should have release the game more stable hope they fix in the futur about the microtransactions i dont think you need to buy or they are are worth you can get them easy ingame and even if you buy the portcrystal you gonna need a ferrystone to use it anyway and you can get both ingame
