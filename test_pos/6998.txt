2016 after some gameplay i decided to write a review for this game product welcome to future 2070 year when robots mechanics and etc is alive and you got some jetpack exo suits welcome to black ops 3 let s get started with pros and then cons campaigncampaign is pretty solid to be honest it tells you a story about nano chips upgrades and pointing to you that friends can betray you at any time anywhere its not that long but if you want to complete it on veteran difficulty it will be longer of course overall not that bad like people is saying about that they probably don t complete it on veteran difficulty yes it s a bit linear because it s call of duty but every single cod campaign is like that run and gun also in campaign map is kinda restricted which sucks but in nightmare mode it s not overall 7 10 multiplayerhm what to say about this game mode its kinda classic same as previous games it feels like a game mode or dlc rather than full game but in other way it feels different because of jetpack much more easier to use than exo suit and also you can run on walls prince of persia style its rapid its ultra fast mode and its fast paced so if you want to buy this game play with bots on hard difficulty before you get into the multiplayer or you will be slaped in face by prestige masters or other people who plays this game a lot and you will not understand how are they so overpowered also in mp you get cryptokeys for finished match to open common and rare drops similar copy paste from counter strike global offensive but it completely free except if you are idiot to buy cod points for 50 freakin dollars and open those crates for untradable skins also much better is that you actually get cryptos for free when you playing a lot overall 7 10 zombieswhat can i say about mode that keep this game alive and other call of duty games its fantastic have a great maps but you can get a only one shadow of evil with based game other are dlc but important and better news is that game got mod tools and map editor for zombies after 7 8 years it s here on black ops 3 this game mode dont have and futuristic stuff any jetpacks its normal and just run and gun with milion fantastic easter eggs over map overall 9 10 nightmare mode story mode with zombies its story mode but with zombies all over the map its great option for people who like to play zombie mode like me it feels like dlc but its completely free and great option to see how will other single player maps will work with zombies 8 10 freerunpretty solid training mode for jetpack and running its pretty solid option to have if you dont know how to use jetpack system properly overall 7 10lets get with cons now because this game got a lot of cons d campaign game ai is so horrible its so stupid that enemies will kill you through wall in veteran difficulty its like wallhacking also i got r9 290x gpu but also on nvidia you can see some graphical glitches and pixelated textures even if your game is setted to a maximal graphics and effects some enemies got randomly more health than others but when you restart the checkpoint it will be reduced to normal as it should be before lol some checkpoints can be glitched and automatically get you killed aka spawn to die checkpoint multiplayer microtransactions cod points are cancer before in older games you can get everything for free now you can get almost everything for free but you need to play too much game for some unlock cod points costs from 2 50 dollars or euros depends on your country some weapons are so overpowered also perks but thats optional thing and it will probably be fixed in more updates community its so toxic cancerogenic that i can t describe too much kids raging too much kiddy boosted prestige masters peeps that can actually mod their game for some pre fire assets and wallhacking but don t get me wrong this game got some excellent and brutally good players but most of players are not cooperative and don t want to play together like team cancerogenic camping with shotgun or rapid snipers oh yes people and kids in this game can camp for whole game with rapid shotgun so noobish and so cancerogenic it s not tactic its noobish thing you know don t get me wrong i destroyed them anyway random fps drops in this game is soooo bad i got r9 290x intel xeon cpu from 2007 with 3 0 ghz and 8 gb of ram and game is runing most of time 80 fps avg but in some random places it can be 10 fps but in next spawn it will be normal so stuttering and drops are here which is bad also in zombie mode too did i mentioned spawn to die system yes its here like in previous games nat type uggggghhhh its so annoying that you play with friends and just after 2 hours session lobby will crash and you must restart your game and router to make it work again because game changes your nat type to strict randomly even with port forwarding even with 30mb s you get about 30 60 ping i live in serbia and on other games i got 10 ping easily zombies game stuttering on shadow of evil map on footlight district is so bad it will random drop your fps from 100 to 20 and will lagg a little bit sometimes game can randomly stutter anywhere because its not patched properly since february month servers are slowly dying in this mode but they will be back because mod tools will be soon released in this game mode also sessions longer than 2 hours with friends will crash and disconnect you from servers annoying stuff drop system is extra rare even if you open doors buying weapons and etc you can barely get 3 4 liquid diviniums keys for gobblegums nightmare some zombies have a glitched health one of them needs to be shooted 3 times in head some casual zombies with casual health must be shooted 10 times in head with powerfull weapon strange glitch in veteran difficulty zombies can glitch in your back which gives you instadeath even if they needed to spawn in front of you graphics not so good in this game because its 9 years old engine with newer stuff in him but you can easily see a pixels blurry textures and bugs over maps and textures so 6 10 for graphics on maxed detail i think some older cods looks more polished gameplay its classic and you will enjoy it but minor glitches and bugs can frustrate you as 7 10overall i can give this game a honest 7 10 its super game but got some really really bad glitches also cancerogenic community
