space marine 2 blends and delivers on everything i wanted for a space marine game the gun play is super satisfying and the melee combat is just on peak it has been a while since i have played such a smooth game which just flows like water the coop runs smoothly to as playing with 2 other friends has been a joy to experience the entire campaign with them and the operations it has been a absolute blast and stressful from the hordes of tryanids and heretics bombarding us i really highly recommend this game especially if you can grab 2 friends to play with thank you saber
