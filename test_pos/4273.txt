2017 tl dr version great game heavy grind but no paywall if you like the gameplay you won t mind the grind good storyline still being developed runs on a potato full version hi this is my first review and it is fitting that this is the game that gets it why because it spoke to my inner child i m 30 the one that discovered that samus was a girl while playing super metroid or watched frog glenn split the mountain entrance with masamune in chrono trigger that awe when the game gives you more than you expected how i will tell you i played warframe since the beggining no vor s prize as intro or 4 revives per mission more like 4 revives per day the grind was just as bad as it is now this is a free 2 play game expect some type of grind but i liked the gameplay so i stuck around for more they developed more content pretty fast so i kept coming back the community grew i lurked like a lurker and watched as the lore grew and evolved 2 or 3 years of that and then the second dream quest came around i ve kept this in mind it s a f2p game it does not have to be a rich game hell even hots said you shouldn t think too hard about these things so yeah space magical ninjas go and have fun but second dream came they have made a storyline a good and compelling storyline and it s still being developed with more content every year i came for the ninjas but stayed because this is a game that care about being more than a bunch of mechanics tied together by gameplay and aestetics this would be seen in full price release but it s a f2p with no pay wall except if your want to do fashionframe as color schemes are behind a pay wall etc long story short ninjas play free
