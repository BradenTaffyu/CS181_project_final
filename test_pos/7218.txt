it seems like most people have forgotten what dragon s dogma was before the dark arisen release edits marked with first of all i got to say i m not defending micro transaction or the devs choice to add them if you want to give this game a bad review because of that then its totally understandable but some reviews are very misleading and paints the devs as more of evil mustachio twirling villains than they are this is by no way close to blizzard or other companies in level of disgusting 1 fast travel with portcrystals are locked behind a mt paywall this is false in my playthrough i gained 4 5 portcrystals just from exploring and doing quests it was enough to space them out for easy travel most of the times i actually used the oxen service because i was out of ferry stones 2 character edit is locked behind a mt paywall this is also false right now you only have 2 full recreation tickets per playthrough the devs have now uped it to 99 these cost 500 rc which is really easy to get and you will have enough of them by mid game to basically never worry about them 3 no multiple characters option to start over some has stated that this is a lack of freedom to try out different vocations this is just wrong since you can change vocations when ever you want and you no longer have to level different vocations for your end build like in the previous games they have now added a start a new game that overwrites your current file 4 performance issues yes this game has some horrendous performance in major cities the devs are aware of this as well and are working on a solution but i have seen people with hardware waaaay below the recommended specs complain about this no it will stutter if you have a i5 gen 8 when the game is depending so much on a strong cpu i had a constant of 70 60 fps whilst outside of towns inside the towns i had 30 50 with major drops when a town was attacked every thing on max dlls on quality 2560x1440 specs at bottom performance is better but still wobbly in cities 5 finalok so everyone please lay down your torches and pick forks for a second and look at the mt content they offer it s all in the game already you don t have to pay anything extra to enjoy the game as the game was intended exploration time consuming as it is but none the less if you only have 10 hours in the game you haven t even played it even if the above statement is ridiculous its true this game will take time a review talking about ingame content or lacking of content that is under 10 hours has not even left the first area of the map and have not explored that area to 100 the big but every fix is still just a promise they will add they will fix in coming patches don t worry the dragons are coming right now its only performance that is still an issue ok now to the game after almost doing a 100 on this game story is decent but i just finished the main story and i have to say it felt short now i see you looking at my almost 100 hours at the time of this review and hold up wait a minute i did a lot of stuff side quests almost all vocations and their ultimate skills romances you name it but i didn t do it all and that says a lot about the content that s in the game but the main quest felt like you where following a breadcrumb trail while enjoying the scenery which can be really nice specially when the areas looks great and have a lot of details this game is a adhd nightmare i m not diagnosed but every chance i got i said you to the pawn guiding me to a quest to see what this other path lead and oh boy there are some awesome areas you miss out on if you just blaze through the game some argue it s the same game again well yes like the darksouls game are technically the same game again but wait there is more the modding community has already been working like crazy and you can already find mods like unlimited stamina outside of battle and real fov slider and surly more is to come the world and its inhabitants i would summarize the game to be on the level of dragons dogma 1 when it comes to variations of enemies you have your standards of goblins skeletons lizardos bandidos draginos ogrerrendae cyclopos dadeiahfgeslf the list goes on but they also have dark variants for the bigger monsters and a couple of new ones these enemies walk around their respective areas but can be seen fighting from time to time i have seen some reviews saying there s a lack of variations but there are like 4 5 different variations of saurians that is not just a dark variant they are made from different elements and live in different climates and look pretty cool that s basically the feeling of the world everything is pretty cool untill a gryphin wrecks my desert crank lift and wipes my whole party there are random quests that pop up here and there with people to save monsters to cull or escort missions they are ok but it would be nice if the escort person would actually say where they want to go before you accept it i might be wanting to hunt down a dragon in the area walked from the capital and camped to get here and they just want to be escorted to the capital no way peasant you are now on the dragon hunter squad vocations i was really sad to see that the assasain was removed as it was my go to vocation in dd1 so we got theif and archer no daggers and bow just daggers or bow i felt my breathing going faster and my typing fingers loading up to rant about why i hated this but i calmed down and gave the theif and archer a chance and now i like it with all the vocations and special vocations from dd1 and specially with the new spear hand which is totally op and broken af but more of that later most of the regular vocations would be well obsolete they would only be an annoying hurdle to pass to get to the vocation you wanted with this new system all vocations are unique and dare i say fun buff archer ult pls its so baby tier rn m reowshrsji brdb ok imagine being a jedi that can tank any attack in the game even the dragoins meteor showers and lightning attacks imagine being fus ro da yeeted off high hrhorghharhhf just to stand up and dust yourself off imagine being able to teleport around the fight like narutos daddy throwing on the enemy and just appearing on them now imagine being able to spear the heart of a dragon with a powerful magic projectile that will make the dragon backflip into the sky right through the moon this is the spear hand vocation ok that might be too much but you get my meaning the vocation actually have a bubble spell it makes you immune to all dmg for a short while ok how short are we talking like 5 secs so you have to time it perfectly no its like 4 seconds it outlasts most channel attacks and it costs so little stamina so you can keep it up an entire boss fight and it bubbles your pawns as well i no joke didn t take a single point of dmg from the end boss when i challanged him with this class and none of my pawns died there was tools in the boss arena that could be used on the boss but i didnt even have to use them just bubble away it takes a lot of time to get any where and it can be confusing to figure out what the game wants from you or what you can expect from the game but then the areas are so nice so some people wont mind the time taken some people like to figure everything out even if it might be cryptic and non nonsensical at times its not a game where you can get a feel of it within the refund time this is not dark arisen its going to lack some quality of life things only buy at full price if you are sure you are going to enjoy it im off to ng have a nice one specs win 10 x64cpu gen 11 i9 11900fgpu 3070 ti rtx ram 32 gig
