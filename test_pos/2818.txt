2021 first of all if you re looking to buy just for the singleplayer you re all set it s a blast to play and having dumped a lot of hours into the console versions it runs like a dream on my pc and is a more enjoyable experience for sure if you have the hardware now for the gta online side this is where i would suggest some caution if you re looking to just play solo and randomly hop into public servers it s going to be a gamble whether you get a relatively decent server or one full of cheaters modders running around deleting things from existence like they re roleplaying as thanos the online side definitely can be fun to help avoid issues like that i d definitely suggest looking for a gta crew to join there s plenty out there that have a decent community and once you start joining up on crew only sessions the online is a totally different experience
