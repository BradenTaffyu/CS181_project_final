a very mediocre thumbs up the game is free and worth the price there is no play to win the cosmetics you can buy are terribly overpriced but some of them are nice enough that i threw a aaa game s price tag worth of money at it and i enjoyed what i got the promotional video pretty much shows all the best parts instead of a truly bizarre world with a fantastic apocalypse we get a reskinned low grade zombie apocalypse with a handful of truly wonderful monsters the open world is vast the building system is serviceable it scratches that open world survival crafting itch but the game is shallow it is another mmorpg that counts on the multiplayer experience to make up for how cursory everything is the missions are boring the lore is bland there is no ultimate truth worth uncovering because the story isn t deep enough for that the fact that the last story missions require four man teams is telling couple this with a menu system that is hard to navigate and a lack of explanation as to how a lot of things work along either bad translations or initial bad writing for what exists the game is not something i would actively recommend but also not something i would steer people away from because even with its downsides i can enjoy cruising around on my motorcycle which you can get quite early and upgrade the quality of several times through a somber and beautiful landscape dotted with uninspired but graphically solid ruins tended by loitering corpse monsters i can run around looting areas come home and break down the trash i have picked up for useful parts that fill my storage chests until i have use for them and i can enjoy my player home especially thanks to a few purchases and when i m bored but don t have the energy to do anything productive that s not a bad way to waste my time
