2021 i have a lot of experience playing fps games but no game has me returning to it quite like siege ngl a very steep learning curve at around 50 60 hours of game time you ll still be learning the basics but believe you me it s worth it cuz in the end you re investing your time in a game which i genuinely find worth playing yes it has its issues but which game doesn t the game is very well balanced i believe ubi has done a good enough job balancing out operators so a single operator doesn t get insta locked and overused i find this interesting cuz the roster keeps changing every round and everyone needs to improvise the amount of sheer skill and map knowledge one requires in siege is insane and after all that you ll still just be an average player good luck
