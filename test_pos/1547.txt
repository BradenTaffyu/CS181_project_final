2022 warhammer 1 had a simple campaign which consisted of grow your empire and survive the chaos invasion warhammer 2 had the vortex campaign with resource gathering for the base 4 factions and a myriad of other factions with unique goals added as dlc this iteration warhammer 3 has a very different campaign that focuses on survival and fulfilling the campaign goal i believe this is good campaign that will only get better with more development baring the technical issues right now during launch the game is great and if you liked the previous games then this one is just as good
