2022 i have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance draining when researching for perfomance tests of wallpaper engine i didn t quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself it should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software hardware specs cpu i5 6400 no overclock with bclk cpu cooler aio watercooling loop from nzxtgpu gtx 980ti msi no manual overclock ram 16gb ddr4 gskill 2133mhz dual kit motherboard asus rog maximus viii rangerssd samsung 850 evo only for os steam and apps on hdd os windows 10 professionaltest the software run in non 64 bit mode will be tested in two scenarios arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests 1 hardware usage will be observed while the system sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background the tool for hw monitoring is openhardwaremonitor this testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets low medium and high and a standard windows desktop background as reference cpu temperaturecpu loadgpu temperaturegpu loadgpu memory usagepreset none low medium highcputempavg 21 c 20 c 20 c 20 ccputempmin 18 c 18 c 18 c 18 ccputempmax 25 c 22 c 22 c 23 ccpuloadavg 1 3 3 3 cpuloadmin 0 4 0 4 0 1 0 4 cpuloadmax 24 10 24 24 gpuloadavg 0 1 7 10 15 gpuloadmin 0 1 1 1 2 gpuloadmax 5 11 16 21 gputempavg 35 c 36 c 37 c 37 cgputempmin 34 c 35 c 36 c 36 cgputempmax 36 c 37 c 38 c 38 cgpumemoryuse 180mb 185mb 230mb 260mbfurthermore the ram usage has been tested but did not show measureable differences ram usage was always at about 2 2gb 2 this test will show the impact on gaming performance again arsenal wallpaper is used this time on preset high as there are different options to choose which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen keep running stop pause a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background i chose the benchmark scene from rainbow six siege with the graphics on ultra preset here are the results fps in rb6 benchmarkrb6s minfps avgfps maxfpsnone 102 173 327stop 93 172 264pause 100 172 296keep running 58 171 299conclusion as we have been able to see there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage i was surprised that the software did much better than expected but the results may differ considering community made wallpapers may use more resources the cpu temperature values may not be very reliable due to the cpu being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale wallpaper engine does also have an impact on gaming performance which can be kept to a minimum using the pause or stop behaviour for fullscreen applications with a hardware config as enthusiast as mine i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit at the end of the day you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a a can be taken literally wallpapers or not i do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on
