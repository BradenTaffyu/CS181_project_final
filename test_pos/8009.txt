2020 early access review i am officially old constantly receiving froward invitations from aarp and wondering why kids keep congregating on my lawn so platformers please i m not that kind of gamer twitch games in general flummox me but full physics in a pixel based world how intriguing is that so i was seduced into trying the game the first thing i found is that there are really just three movement controls up left and right down is there but incidental and it includes ah consuming things on the ground which works but eccchhh yeah okay so the first thing you ll discover is that moving around is easy this is not some platformer where you have to memorize a sequence of moves just to get from one side of the screen to the other no this is the cave of procedural generation and therein lies genius in the game everything you do even walking around has an effect on the area around you shoot things and they fall or tear apart or explode or catch fire or dissolve with acid drop heavy things on something not heavy and you ll crush it put metal in water and it will rust different liquids have different densities every pixel has a platonic nature soil acid snow sand gunpowder grass fungus teleportatium and many others and you can be coated by them or use them to set off effects or even be trapped by unpleasant developments drowning under newly growing ice in a pond is a distinct possibility it s the physics effects on every pixel that make the game so interesting and amusing obviously the game also has enemies for you to die fighting each with their own effects floating acid dudes small fast melee critters fire demons guys with shotguns or other weapons terrain eating speedy worms all sorts of stuff to deal with them you have wands and potions potions to coat yourself with or ward off fire and acid or increase your crits or transform enemies or many other effects you can throw them or kind of shake them up and shoot them nearby say to fill a hole with water to remove pesky fire wands well wands are the weapons of the game wands have varying natures spell slots latency mana stores and recharge times etc there are many different spells and spells can be stacked to produce enhanced effects or to chain different effects together you generally start off with two small sparky spells that fly out and do a little damage in a fairly straight line as you gather spells and wands in game you might add a trail of flaming dust to each shot thus causing fires underneath the flight path or maybe a spell that lets you fire three shots at once there are all kinds of interesting projectiles and effects some quite interesting and unusual some entirely deadly to you as well as your enemies there is an interesting sub game of configuring your wands with new spells especially as enemies get harder to deal with meaningful choices abound so this game is a classic roguelike in nature even though it is not composed of alpha numeric characters everything can kill you including the ground you stand on stuff happens off screen at times which can lead to chain effects that can mess with you you ll quickly find that the game is as much stealth shooter as it is a run and gun one and you constantly have to mind where you are going to avoid the perils of fire acid whiskey and even falling burning beams and gunpowder pits in short this game is entirely accessible to non twitch games with easy controls huge variety impeccable replayability and an environment that wants you dead it s an avalanche of sheer fun highly recommended
