this game is completely and totally free the whole p2w gacha system that people are complaining about via the wish machine can be farmed for by bosses and higher tier enemies within the game i don t understand where the negative criticisms are coming from other than the lack of controller support and eu servers being down for a bit this game is really good and with starry studios being the ones responsible for this game i have high hopes i loved the demo and i still love this game
