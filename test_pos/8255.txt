2023 short reviewthis is a game that i would highly recommend it s a fun experience with intricate gameplay fun mechanics and difficult enemies i have an issue with the bulk of the gameplay this game has to offer being hidden behind the secret post game but that isn t a big enough issue to not give this game a chance if you have a chance i recommend giving this game a try full reviewjust to preface this review all of my statements in this review are based upon my full completion of the game and interaction with all the post game content that the game has to offer with that out of the way i ll go into the aspects that i liked about the game and why i would highly recommend it while also giving a few cons here and there the pixel world interactions this is another one of the main appeals of noita you re in a world where every pixel has some sort of significance whether it be a benefit or a detriment to your well being you can have the ability to make new substances via some pixels have some substances increase or decrease your resistance to certain environmental factors have some substances influence your movement have some substances make you literally invincible one of the ways to access the secret post game and etc nearly every action you take in this game has an influence on your environment altering it for the rest of the playthrough something as simple as a fight with a basic enemy can create a death trap for yourself in the future or cause some substance to fall on you that near instantly kills you at times there are so many interactions that could be had with the pixel system in noita and it is hard to find a situation that is exactly the same between runs the biomes there are a slew of biomes present in this game actually a majority of the biomes are present in the secret post game rather than the main game so your average player won t get to see most of what this game has to offer in biome variety this is one of the main cons of the game that i will mention later but for now just know that this world is surprisingly vast there are secret chambers located in the depths of the earth housing powerful bosses vast landscapes hidden above the clouds in the sky treacherous environments hidden past the lava pools in the depths of the earth and many more goodies to discover the wand system the wand system is another one of the things that noita prides itself upon the system is ripe for the tinkering of creative minds each wand you find or buy has a base value associated with it and this helps determine the type of wand it should be tailored to for instance a wand with a fast reload speed and fire rate will likely be used for rapid sustained damage whereas a wand with a low reload speed and high damage will likely be used for high burst damage these traits allow you to make wands that act like gatling guns shotguns railguns miniature nukes black hole summoning death rods and many more varieties you will figure out what type of wand suits you best and the game enables you to cater your playstyle even further with your favorite wand type with the many shot types that exist the enemies bosses noita is very creative with their enemy design especially for bosses as you go through the different biomes they will have residents that are hard set on turning you into a pile of meat on the ground wall or whatever other surfaces your sticky remains would stick to the enemies in the harder biomes will make sure this happens very quickly if you aren t careful even if you have very powerful wands and perks heck even in the early game the enemies there will kill you very quickly if you play your cards wrong and i m only mentioning the basic enemies right now the bosses on the other hand are a different story if you aren t well prepared then you can expect a swift death bosses are a threat at basically all portions of the game you have a leviathan that lurks in the depths of the very deep lake to the west a dragon worm nestled inside an egg until you crack it open a deranged alchemist that can deflect any shot you hit them with on a whim and many more that are hidden or very visible throughout the map the post game this was quite the double edged sword for this game i would have to say a majority of my fun came from this section of the game but at the same time the method of reaching this post game is very convoluted and isn t explained well it is like the devs are actively trying to stop people from playing a majority of the content they ve made for the players i won t spoil how to access this post game however just know that there are likely not many individuals out there that could figure this out with the clues given within the game as before you reach the post game the gameplay somewhat punishes you for being too curious despite my qualms about the method of accessing and discovering the post game i believe everything behind it to be a joy it allows you to eventually ascend to proverbial godhood defeat new bosses enemies that you couldn t have beaten in the normal game have access to more perks experiment with more wand varieties and many more things it is a haven for experimentation and exploration but a hellscape for survival as a majority of this game venturing through the post game is very high risk but very high reward overall noita is a difficult game that is overly ambiguous at times but a very engaging experience many players that are fine with the difficulty will have a blast with the variety of enemies bosses the engaging wand system the interactive pixel environment and the bountiful biomes that are ripe for exploration i highly recommend giving this game a shot
