the good the game is amazing especially for one so fresh from early access there are loads of things to with high med and low intensity so you can do something to progress no matter what kind of content you re looking for the story is great and very compelling every single bug or issue i ve had with the game has been such a minor thing that it honestly doesn t take away from the game for me at all and the support team is very good at responding sometimes they use cookie cutter responses but i see no issue with that either because its generally just for things like when they re acknowledging your ticket the bad i ve experienced multiple bugs but given how small they were i m honestly not even bothered none of them prevented me from doing any content in any way it was small things like for example sometimes resources don t stack properly i had 2 stacks of gravel that should have stacked together but they would not so the result of the bug was losing a single storage space for a short time overall this is easily one of my favorite games that has come out in a very very long time and would love to see it become more popular
