2023 disregarding the overpriced dlc s this is actually a pretty awesome game immortal empires feels like the build up that the fans deserved seeing my dragons get shot by rats with miniguns and dinosaurs wreaking havoc on some poor dwarfs is extremely fun the sandbox elements are there and the player base seems healthy enough multiplayer needs some balancing and an actual ladder system instead of just rankings would be nice 10 10 will try to 100 achivements
