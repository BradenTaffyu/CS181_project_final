2022 haven t had any issues personally with a gtx 1070 sucks for those who have just been enjoying my time i don t know if this has anything to do with it but i would recommend people to consider updating their drivers or try different graphic settings may seem obvious but its the only recommendation i can really give at this time perhaps the stutter may also be due to lack of ram for some people i have 24 ram afterall also play as wretch all you cowards
