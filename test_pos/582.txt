2013 i could never really get into counter strike and counter strike source but global offensive is really easy to pick up is pretty polished has nice customization option lots of neat little things all around it s a good mp title i d recommend trying to play with a friend who already knows about the game s mechanics and the metagame too it s a very gradual learning experience
