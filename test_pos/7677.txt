2023 a while ago i gave a now deleted negative review for this game and for where the game was at i think it was well deserved requiring pvp in a game with so much rich pve content was almost worse for me than just releasing a completely awful game the wasted potential for a pve mode or a split progression system was incredibly frustrating and ultimately led to me abandoning the game there are plenty of games with pve modes and pvp modes that work do well and please both sides but they devs continued to try and force pvp only down our throats this was a few years ago and at the time the devs said they weren t looking at a pve mode and that it was against the spirit of the game fast forward to this week and safer seas their version of a pve mode was added to the game i m so glad the devs learned from their mistakes because this game is incredible now that the pvp mode is disabled safer seas certainly isn t perfect it needs more features like higher progression levels for factions etc i just want to experience all the content the game has to offer without the toxic pvp aspect i don t even really care about the 30 rewards the fact that i can t fully level up the factions or participate in events that don t require pvp is more of a bummer for me there are also features like captaincy that were taken out of safer seas that have no business being taken out but the fact that the devs listened to the playerbase at all and added a pve mode is such a positive sign to me that i actually have hope for this game to get even better which i couldn t say a few years ago so here s to hoping that the devs continue to learn grow and provide a fantastic experience for those who want pve pvp or both
