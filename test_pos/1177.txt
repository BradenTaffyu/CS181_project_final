what i like about the game in all honesty i think the game is great played it a year or two ago and completed it it was super fun with all the different builds you can do and all the endings to go along with it there are plenty of boss fights with different sort of weakness while you also have yours along with what i ve stated above i would also say it s fun because of the open world and caves you can discover and off course the lore of the game things i never found fun the elden beast boss fightdesign and phase aside a lot of players mostly took issue with the mechanics of the elden beast the boss is large moves constantly from one side of the arena to another literally makes most of the fight require the player to chase the boss rather than fight it at a distance the boss can also spam spell attacks which makes it super unpleasant to fight the communityi think there s an amount of players and fans who are cool but sadly i would have to say that it s ruined because of brain dead people who tell you what s the right type of way to play and have some sort of god complex over a video game most of dark souls community over the years have been known for being egotistical narcissistic and think that they are above other players because they are playing a different build or whatever grow upconclusionif you can avoid the type of players above i would recommend this game 100 as i said in the first paragraph for the open world and all different ways to play i think this game has a lot of replayability and i don t think one stupid boss fight should ruin that experience get the game and stay away from cringe lords
