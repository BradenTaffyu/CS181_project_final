2016 there are good and very very bad things in this game remember this is my personal opinion but i am reviewing for others i have 297 hours on record at this current moment so i feel that i can review this game to it s full extent just as i will with infinite warfare campaign cool weapon selection super powers pretty much such as control martial and chaos control let s you control robots and such martial is mostly close quarters such as a charge ability a slam ability and a invisiblity chaos is chaos you unleash swarms of mechanical bugs to eat people you shoot robots with fire bolts pretty much and much more confusing story at first very bad story once you understand it characters pointlessly dying if you re looking at cod for it s campaign i do not recommend this game at all multiplayer pick ten system large variety of guns though a lot of them are bad so there are few guns that are the guns that everyone uses one being the kn 44 which is the starting assault rifle the maps are actually pretty good though need to be larger spawns aren t as bad as cod ghosts or advanced warfare but they are still bad due to the insanely small map size the wall running is fun but shouldn t really be in a treyarch game treyarch should go back to boots on the ground sledgehammer can keep doing what it does most of the guns either have unique designs or are based off of modern weapons but look futuristic which is alright but if you re going to have modern guns just make it a modern game some people really like the multiplayer i do not but that is my personal opinion if you want this purely for multiplayer wait for it to drop in price if you kind of want it for multiplayer and zombies get it zombies much much easier then waw bo1 and bo2 perkaholics ruin public matches or any matches at all really headshot sounds are amazing they just feel so rewarding to get or to get the wunderwaffe or thundergun and just blast an entire horde of zombies the story is very good right up until the end which was more of a cliffhanger then anything soe is a very well made map der eisendrache is a very easy but very fun map with lots of replayability zetsubou no shima is a map that some like and some don t i do not like it gorod krovi is an overrated map ever since i completed the easter egg i have not played the map revelations is a dissapointment all in all the game is worth the 60 if you are into multiplayer and zombies but not for campaign also wait for season pass price to drop
