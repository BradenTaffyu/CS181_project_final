2019 this game is by far the best game i have ever played there is so much more to it than just a cod style fps some of the reasons i enjoy it are 1 one shot headshots are you tired or sneaking up on players and then not being able to kill them even when you have the advantage 2 wall penetration with more realistic properties3 a company that regardless of what the pros are complaining about actually cares about the game4 new reworked maps 4 times a year that dont cost extra5 some of the best movement mechanics of any game ive ever played
