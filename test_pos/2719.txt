2019 put in a nutshell amazing game terrible community but first things first the single player campaign is one of the best i ever played the concept of playing three characters is a welcome addition to the gta formula and absolutely pays off as with all the previous gta s the npc are fantastic i thought that brucie from gta iv was the craziest character ever until rockstar introduced trevor in gta v character and mission design are top notch also the level of detail of the game world is incredible too bad that rockstar has never released any single player dlc s now to gta online the concept is amazing as well and the game is continuously updated with new content i like the heists especially the downside is that you definitely need other players for them and that it takes ages to find co op partners especially for the heist set up missions where money and reputation rewards are scarce when you finally find enough players people often drop out in the middle of the mission which leads to an instant fail and you have to find another team not to mention all the player killers in the open world and the long load times in general however if you happen to find decent people to play with or play with friends the game is an absolute blast a word on the rockstar launcher sure it is completely unnecessary that there is yet another launcher to torture pc players with after the launch in september 2019 the game crashed regularly thanks to the launcher as of november 2019 it seems like rockstar managed to solve these problems and the game is running stable most of the time all in all an amazing game but especially gta online could still be so much more
