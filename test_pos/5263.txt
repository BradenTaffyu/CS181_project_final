2020 you may start enjoying this game when you start figuring out what is going on which may take a lot of time even though this game is five years old to me it looks like it s the best it s ever been i bought it in late 2017 and it has marginally improved in all aspects since then big maps and many operators this game has to offer along with it s rather unpleasant monetization scheme may overwhelm you at first but stick around and you might just discover a great game that you did not even know you wanted
