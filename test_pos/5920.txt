2021 ok i think i ve enough play hours in this game to finally put down a review i ve played both sides killer survivor at high level and from i can tell its a great game given the fact the game style is asymmetric this game is very survivor sided only if the survivors are plying in a groups and with comms note for new players we call them swf survivor with friends as they can constantly exchange information about the killer s activity and turn the game pretty one sided but there are some killers in the game that can completely ignore the swf variable to a certain degree the killer roster is pretty versatile but the option is very limited after you reach high elo as only fewer killers are viable in high ranks these are the only viable killers in high level against good swfs spirit nurse pyramid head blight hag doctor freddy twins sometimes bubba and pig rest of the roster are pretty useless unless you have like 2k hours on killers so that can basically end every chase within 15 20 seconds and slug when needed note even the top killers i mentioned takes a lot of time to learn especially nurse even spirit is no joke to learn a lot of game senses and predictions are required to play spirit efficiently as well i don t like how every time the devs buffs a killer they also nerfs the killer in some other way as well there are a lots of perks in the game that are basically useless and a little buff could change them into playable perks hit boxes are terrible in this game when i play nurse huntress the community is mostly toxic and unwelcoming towards new players especially new killers my first trapper game i got bullied with ds s head on flashlights unnecessarily and endless t bags at the exit gates having no clue half the game what s going on and on top of that abusive texts and endless insults in post game chat this is very discouraging towards new players if this goes on people will stop playing killer and abuse the very killer when they play survivor next time this not only creates a bad cycle but also heavily impacts the match making as fewer people are interested in playing the killer still there are many nice people in this community that appreciate the other sides when they play and i hope more people could have that mindset to make the community better
