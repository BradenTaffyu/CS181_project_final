2021 i played the game before it was on steam since s1 i missed out 6 season then i came back when the game hit steam maybe thats why i was banned anyway apex legends is the only game that banned me for being too good at the game i was unbanned after getting in touch with support and giving all the evidence they asked for then that lead to my account being suspended and locked out after they unbanned me btw they unbanned me after 2 or 3 weeks of waiting for support to get my case yeah it was headache but the game is fun and i dont have to make a 5 star hotel to win so hey d glad to be back in apex and i highly recommend it to anyone i love how the universe of titanfall is in apex maybe we could get some titans in game as an event
