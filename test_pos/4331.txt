2016 i made a review back in 2016 it s 2019 and i m back in the game with a better review tl dr at the bottom main features at the bottom before tl drpros 1 everything is obtainable if you play the game with the exception of the founders pack some of it is definitely grindier than others but you re able to obtain every single thing in the game without paying anything that is of course whether you re willing to invest a buttload of time into the game 2 fantastic graphics on low end pcsi ve had to use a laptop for majority of my gaming and warframe is definitely up there in optimization my potato laptop is able to load in fortuna and cetus open world content albeit slightly longer load times i run the game on the lowest graphical settings and it still looks like high quality graphics from a aaa game from 2012 ish 3 gameplay with the added open world content the gameplay has gotten even better archwing combat is actually viable now killing eidolons and profit takers without any guides are by far one of the most fun things i ve done in my entire life of playing video games the gameplay remains fast paced engaging and hardly gets dull 4 the dev team the dev team is by far one of the most dedicated teams out there bugfixes occur within a day of an exploit or bug being found this is nothing like ubisoft s r6 which i absolutely love dev team where it literally takes months for bugs to be fixed months even with the player community constantly updating reddit withh footage of the bugs and yet de manages to fix things within a day in a free to play game the dev team is awesome and they listen to the community majority of the times 5 community is so disgustingly nice it reminds me of the people from the good place veteran players are all copies of good janet and literally help newbies when they re bored in my 3 ish years of playing the game on and off i ve only encountered one player and even then it was mainly because he misunderstood things my in game warframe playtime has touched 1000 hours i think an encounter rate of 1 per 1000 hour is insanely good lol 6 the game now provides some guidance and direction 3 years ago it felt more like a diablo game collect stuff and make the best build to one shot everything now planet junctions along with a huge number of storyline quests to do provide the game a direction for new players to work towards these quests and junctions allow new players to unlock warframes and weapons progressively through increasing difficulty it s easier to play the game now without having to refer to the wiki every 5mins cons 1 still a pretty bad tutorial tutorial remains pretty unchanged since 2016 covers basic gameplay with maneouvers just the tip of the iceberg however the community has somehow become even better and more friendly since then a friend of mine who ve just started was shown the ropes by random players who he met during public missions though you ll probably have to google a few guides it does help that warframe has grown in popularity on youtube and plenty of youtubers like iflynn make introductory videos and how to s explaining many of the in game mechanics in detail 2 pay 4 convenience this remains unchanged you pay to skip ahead anyone who grinds will attain the same content as someone who has paid a large chunk of the content is only obtainable by playing the game 3 limited areas to play in still it wasn t open world when i first wrote this review they ve begun implementing open world content which i have spent hours upon hours on and they re planning on making even more which is insane however the open world content are still separate instances with a maximum of 4 players in each instance i feel like it would ve been great if the 4 player limit per instance for open world content were removed because it s so vast yet feels empty with a full squad at times 4 it s not as easy to get burnt out 3 years later and you ll get burnt out when you first start i recently got 3 friends to try out warframe whilst they weren t getting burnt out due to the addition of planet junctions they took frequent breaks due to crafting times a sizeable chunk of the early game content got them leaving the game to play something else because majority of it doesn t get looked at early defense missions can take over 10 15mins for just 5 waves because of the tileset and buggy ai easy missions turn tideous because the dev team doesn t really look into this 5 the lore is a jigsaw puzzleas someone who loves digging into the lore i spent years learning about warcraft lore warframe is one of those games where i can never bring myself to learn about the lore because of it s all over the place the quests provide information about the lore but it s poorly developed on not recommended for those who play games for the story features new updates all the time now with fortuna and cetus as open world content a lot of warframes which act as classes extremely flexible detailed mechanics modding damage 2 0 large amount of viable weapons majority are extremely different from each all are able to be molded to endgame though not practical at times fantastic graphics incredibly optimized expect smooth framerates throughout plenty of customization and cosmetics you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you limited areas to play in repetitive very limited number of mission types pvp is pointless you don t get much other than cosmetics ridiculously grindy at times limited trades each day tallies with your mastery rank which you can increase by leveling items limited inventory appears as a cash grab quite early on but you can earn platinum through trading tldr it s free and not pay to win runs on potato pcs you can obtain everything if you spend time and effort play if you like loot based games play if you love insane mobility and gunplay buttload of content which would take at least 400 600hrs to cover everything even with guides grindy with stupid unnecessary daily limitations and caps community is awesome devs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes
