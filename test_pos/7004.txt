2018 get it for zombies the zombies game mode is why you should buy black ops 3 i love how they added rpg elements into zombies i ve been playing a lot and have 258 hours on the game as of right now so i can say i know if i enjoy it or not i m prestiged 9 level 30 right now in zombies the characters are fun the cutscenes are cool and the gameplay is great bo3 zombies is my favorite zombies for a few reasons 1 rpg elements2 interesting story line3 customizable guns4 characters get to be badass5 double pack a punch overpowered makes wall guns do everything you need but still 6 you can play some of the old maps with some dlc gobblegum leaves me with mixed feelings it s way overpowered and monetized still also the dlc should be free at this point and that goes for all the cod games dlc shouldn t mean spend more money i bought the dlc because activision will probably never get their heads out of their asses
