2018 at the time i m writing this review i have played over 400 hours in this game that s campaign multiplayer and zombies combined but i would estimate that three quarters of that time i ve spent in zombies i ll give my thoughts on all three sections the best i can i have a lot to say on this game so i apologize in advance for rambling campaign do not buy this game if you re looking for a good campaign this is certainly the worst aspect of this game the campaign just lacks in a lot of aspects especially the story the story is confusing as heck and honestly quite difficult to even follow at all much too futuristic possibly worst of all is that it has basically no connection to either bo1 or bo2 campaigns which were both amazing there are plenty of steam achievements to complete in campaign which is the only reason i chose to periodically come back to it multiplayer i feel like i need to give a quick disclaimer for this one i know a lot of cod players mostly play the game for the multiplayer but personally i prefer the zombies because i don t play mp too much i m never too critical of multiplayer in cod games i just sorta find them all to be pretty similar i know they ve all got many differences i just enjoy them all more or less the same with that in mind there s really not a whole lot to say if you like the advanced movement system and all that you may very well enjoy this game i never really played aw or iw so i hadn t ever really gotten tired of the advanced movement however a lot of people think this isn t a very good multiplayer so i would certainly get some other opinions than just mine if you are considering this game for the multiplayer but i know i certainly had fun with this zombies the zombies mode in this game is what makes black ops 3 one of my favorite games ever i m not exagerating the only downside would of course be having to buy all the dlcs if you re skeptical on buying those i would highly suggest it especially since you can now buy the season pass maps without actually having to buy the pass i have all maps on the season pass as well as the zombies chronicles both packs are incredible if you ve played either bo1 or bo2 then you ll certainly enjoy the chronicles especially but what really makes this game great is just how stinking fun it is on the surface the game is really just shooting up zombies trying to survive as long as possible it s quite simple however as you get better and better and start to learn the maps more aspects of the game are opened up to you i love to play der eisendrache one of the season pass maps because it s perfect for doing anything it s great for casual or if i just wanna focus on getting the upgraded bows or if i m really feeling it i can try and do the main easter egg there s just always something to do there are times when i get on this game and i can t decide what to play because there are too many maps i just simply can t decide it s too fun whether it be by yourself or with some friends unfortunately it s pretty hard to find public matches now one more bonus is that if you get this game on pc there are loads and loads of custom zombies maps and some of those are real good overall many people would say not to get this game for the multiplayer and everyone would say not to get this game for the campaign if you re thinking about getting this for the zombies though definitely get it i can t begin to tell you how amazing this mode is you just have to experience it yourself and get the dlcs although this game wasn t recieved by the public too positively i d say the zombies mode carries this game to a perfect 10 10
