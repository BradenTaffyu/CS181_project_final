2022 depending on who you are this could be a really good game it s a perfect storm for toxicity but i feel like it also has a huge amount of potential for the same reasons a lot of people hate r6 for good reason but if this is the game for you then it really is for you pros game basically has limitless potential there s just so much to do strategy wise can be extremely fun with friends frequently goes on sale for 8 which is a pretty fair asking price imo frequent updates content occasional free weekends cons extremely toxic sometimes game was made with the sole purpose of raising your blood pressure unless you play escape from tarkov regularly you will probably find r6 stressful to some degree can be really frustrating sometimes even if you normally enjoy r6 insanely large learning curve you are much less likely to enjoy this game if you don t have friends to play withi think r6 is more of a strategy game than a shooting game and there is a lot of strategy to unpack between the operators you pick the map the way you interact with the map how you work with your team and what the other team does there are tons of unique ways to solve any given problem i have dreams of playing this game the strategy is fun and this is all ten times more true if you have a group of friends to play with that being said r6 is not for everyone randoms are toxic the game is inherently stressful there s a huge learning curve and it takes a very long time to figure out what s happening valorant s 5 minute tutorial is enough to get you into a game it takes 5 minutes of searching online after you lost a round of r6 to figure out why the floor blew up below you the moment you entered a room with no visible traps you likely won t see what makes r6 so good within the 2 hour return window and if you ll want to return it before then it s understandable if you re looking for a casual experience and aren t used to playing competitive games casually this won t be a walk in the park it s stressful and people are sweaty once you know what all the 60 operators do and what all the maps are like and which walls are destructible and if you have friends watching cameras for you your chance of cardiac arrest goes down but getting to that point takes some time tldr if you re looking at this game and you think you ll like it do you have a couple friends to play with this is the most important are you ready for a very big learning curve are you okay with playing a stressful game watch a tutorial on how to play the game just so you know what you re getting into maybe watch a tutorial on 1 2 operators you re interested in still feeling good if you answered yes to all of these questions r6 goes on sale for as low as 8 if you re still on the fence there are occasionally free weekends keep tabs on the game and try it out with friends when it s free to play there s a 50 chance this game will mess you up and a 50 chance you ll find it really interesting hopefully this helps you figure out which half you re a part of
