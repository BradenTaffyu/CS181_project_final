2022 its kinda funny cuz it s only been 2 months since 2022 started and i already know the game of the year resultsupdate now that i ve spent over 300 hours on this game i can really say that i almost enjoyed every second of it which is rare for someone like mehere s the things that i hated the mostsometimes when you not even fighting anything you can t access the map cuz somewhere something is agro on you and you gotta wait for it to leave you alone or find it and kill it weapons are not balanced yet for both pvp and pve which is fine cause the game just droppedlow fps and stutters on some of the most important open world areas i got a 3060 btw and my friend has a 6900 xt which is equal to 3090 and even he s getting drops you can t ride on mounts in coop mode i think that s all that i remember for now tbh the game is perfect and beautiful at the same time its not even a game at this point it s an art it has some issues that every new released game had especially an rpg game and its hopefully gonna get fixed soon and i don t know what other people that disliked the game expected from a newly released fromsoftware bandai namco souls like open world gamethat s all
