2023 best non fromsoft souls like by far very good combat although some enemies are damage sponges there s no jank also it s a perfect pc port haven t experienced any crashes or bugs performance is very good too on a laptop 3070 running on 1440p ultrawide locked 72fps with no dropped frames the story is also very interesting and kept me wanting to know more and a lot longer than i expected finished in 37 hours while trying not to miss anything
