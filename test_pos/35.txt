at first i thought this game was gonna be another souls like but after playing and getting my first death i didn t lose any xp or anything it all stayed with me feels more like a chinese version of god of war because of the mythology mixed with devil may cry with all the skills and stuff yeah this game s got that playstation vibe after waiting 4 years for this i gotta say i m not disappointed but the optimization could ve been better especially with the cinematic graphics setting other than that it s solid i didn t get any stutters or crashes and the game runs super smooth on very high settings
