2016 early access review never have i ever felt so satisfied off a purchase i made with tools to construct your own live wallpapers options to customize adding sound effects audio color schemes to select settings to maintain fluidity 60fps max controls for cpu and ram usage full support of steam workshop variety ranging from audio enabled interactive and resolutions upto 4k the ability to add your own custom video clips gifs achievements and trading cards to collect this is the best thing out there that is worth every penny of the price you pay for it if you are concerned about your in game fps or the tampering of the performance of your heavy software mind you that you can select in preferences to pause your live wallpaper when another program is maximized over the desktop or that which is in focus i could only wonder where this had been all my life this is way better than any of the other live wallpaper softwares i ve used such as stardock deskscapes 8 where you had to pay more than this product s price for its yearly subscription having features and content no where near what this offers i whole heartedly recommend this
