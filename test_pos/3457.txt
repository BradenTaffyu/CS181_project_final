2020 introgrand theft auto 5 is the current latest game from the gta franchise after the monumental success of grand theft auto rockstar games decided to make a sequel to the hd universe in sunny los santos inspired by los angeles the game was released on september 17th 2013 and is to date the most successful piece of entertainment media just to mention in this review i won t mention gta 5 online because that it a game on it s own gameplaythe gameplay for gta 5 is a great example of perfection everything is brilliantly paced nothing feels that it was shallow or rushed missions end with you finding new things out about the game and its lore gunplay is very satisfying aiming to feel so fluid and responsive the variety of weapons and their addons is massive there are 30 weapons all with customizability shotguns have a loud and powerful punch pistols having that firm grip and the snipers having that shrouded effect graphicsthe gta 5 graphics were in 2013 groundbreaking almost 7 years later that claim still stands the graphics are absolutely stunning rockstar games really are known for their level of detail every piece of shrubbery is unique in its own way it s amazing how they managed to stuff a world that big in a game storybefore i start spoiler warning ahead in gta 5 you play as 3 main protagonists franklin clinton a 25 year old guy trying to escape gang life and trying to actually do something influential in his life a newcomer to the criminal life he is also a talent for driving michael desanta townley a 48 year old trying to live a good life after being a full time criminal in the late 90s and early 2000s during a heist in ludendorff the united states michael and one of his partners in crime brad snider both were shot after fleeing the police brad didn t survive the shot but michael did michael made a deal with the fib to fake his own death during that time he tried to cut contacts with his other partner in crime trevor phillips which is are next character trevor phillips a close contact of michael desanta who in 9 years met new people in the outskirts of san andreas and founded his own company with ron jakowski called trevor philips enterprises an uprising drug smuggling company trying to get a bigger sponsor to make his company larger he is also a psychopath and he s talented in aiming and killing the story feels very good it all fits together nicely and in the singleplayer campaign you meet a lot of unique characteristics which you would never probably meet in real life the idea of having 3 protagonists is genius in my opinion mainly because you are able to see certain aspects in the game from different perspectives level designgta 5 s level design is of most rockstar s games linear and innovative in every mission you re given tasks which reap the main goal the recreation of los angeles is spot on having been in la i knew exactly where i was going most of the time some parts are of course fictional and don t exist in real life but it s executed so well that it might as well be in real life contentgrand theft auto 5 is a big game period it features over 60 innovative and diverse missions besides that there are a lot of little small quests that don t affect the main story the game took me over 40 hours to beat the first time and i enjoyed every single moment of it i ve even become fond of the mission fails controls and movementthe controls are fluid responsive and free movement by foot is a bit sluggish but that s to be expected because you have so many vehicles to chose from and walking is only used when necessary fun fact there are currently 464 vehicles in gta 5 including gta 5 online difficultythe difficulty of gta 5 missions isn t hard most missions are easy and are fun although saying that i can say i ve failed a mission more than 1000 times musicthe music in gta 5 is amazing for me it is up there with gta san andreas soundtrack the diversity of the radio stations is nice and it adds a bit of depth the main theme song for gta 5 is iconic it recreates la so well i can t describe it in words it s popularity shows that youtube video gta v welcome to los santos soundtrack intro
