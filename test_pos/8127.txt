2019 early access review there s a clear lack of polish to many elements there is not even a main menu and the game reboots to give you a new seed dungeon to explore the records after each run don t save you can t enter a seed however i haven t been able to put this game down beyond that the combat feels strategical and like everything is purely in your own control the spell customization is expansive and is easy to pick up but difficult to master it ll take me a few dozen more hours to figure out modifiers and multicasts the generated dungeons are expansive and interesting and destructible to the point where every corner is interesting despite being yet another mineshaft keep in mind though this game is difficult the first stage is kind of easy the second stage already requires a lot more to pass and the third one i have barely reached the fourth i reached once but instantly got obliterated by a skeleton wizard with a yet inpenetrable shield good luck
