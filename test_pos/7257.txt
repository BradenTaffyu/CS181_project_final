i was about to dodge this game due to all the reviews limited fast travel unless i buy more for real life money in a 70 single player game thats outrageous i felt like a pawn when i bought it how can i spend money on such practices do i lack a spine long story short it turns out you cant f king fast travel for reallife money this might actually be the least impactfull microtransactions i have ever seen you cant fast travel for i hate myself for believing all these people with that out of the way the performance is really bad i am playing on a 1080 and i have to run it in 1280 solution which i dont mind to much but keep that in mind when you dont have a nasa rig but the game itself is glorious the combat feels meaty your enemies fly all over the place when you hit them your pawns who talk waaay to much interact in unique ways for example catching you when an ogre attempts to throw you etc truely one of the games where you cant play a session without something memorable happening i dont regret paying for it and i recommend you to play it if you liked the first title it has the exact same spirit but way better
