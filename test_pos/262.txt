2020 my thoughts and opinions on cs gocs go is one of those games that has a really dedicated and rabid fanbase thanks to incredible success of counter strike 1 6 released in 2012 and eight years later the fast paced pc game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles partly because of its established core gameplay and huge active community a big part of its success is due to its massive esports following it s always talked about in streaming sites whether its twitch and mixer the game even includes its own watch a match section so you can follow and spectate live tournaments and competitive matches cs go is also very easily accessible it s free and all you need is a potato with a fine keyboard and mouse and maybe a headset with a mic it runs on basically any pc with decent frames rate a high end pc should give you over 300fps at ultra details you don t need anything fancy or powerful to enjoy which is another reason why there s so big player base pros valve has done everything it can to evolve the game and keep it fresh by staying true to the series one of the greatest competitive first person shooters you can play on steam massive player base and a game that refuses to die includes several maps and nine game modes types including the standard team based pvp casual modes competitive deathmatch arms race community made maps and servers and even a 16 player battle royale mode but you shouldn t really play it for battle royale as its mostly barebones and ugly 100 skill based gameplay and no casual power ups like seen in halos and call of duty cs go relies heavily on reaction time and twitchy movements thus line of sight is one of the biggest advantages you can create excellent sound design but very unrealistic at the same time bullet physics and explosions are still impressive for an engine that is now 16 years old excellent performance runs well even on potatoes and 10 year old pcs and laptops an example of games as a service done well cons well you ll often find some gamers helpful and tolerable to newbies the mass playerbase is unwelcoming and very toxic playing without friends is not recommended negative behavior includes trolls in the team chats people who scream into their mics and people who simply can t keep quiet d some of them might even vote to kick you out because you re new to cs plenty of hackers and cheaters that ruin the fun and fair play for everyone vac engine is mostly automated and not moderated by valve s employees unless during a few rare cases the anti cheat is okay but not any better than other anti cheat solutions seen on pc so yeah cheating exist nearly everywhere these days technically cs go looks very dated and mediocre it hasn t changed a lot from cs source the graphics are mediocre and 2008ish graphics haven t improved relatively much since 2004 s half life 2 aggressive monetization to the point it s become a live gambling show players can choose to spend real money on items and cosmetic material like weapon skins winning and completing tasks rewards you loot boxes that can be unlocked by purchasing keys with real money too much trading could even lead to online gambling addiction the bottom linecs go is one of the most fine tuned first person shooters to date sure while it may look like a 15 year old game and there might be major issues but the fact that the community is thriving speaks volumes this means that this game will constantly be tweaked towards perfection my rating 8 10 very good
