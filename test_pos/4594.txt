2016 this is a very grindy and self motivated game about loot for loot s sake that said you are a backflipping space ninja with unreasonable superpowers and overpowered weaponry basically the core gameplay revolves around running a few basic game types like defense and capture to gear up level equipment and collect resources for more equipment to do it all better though it is a grind it s one about setting entire armies on fire or clawing them apart with your bare hands with your buddies i didn t think much of it at first and it certainly looks like a standard pay to win time waster but after a few hours i found myself having some honest to goodness fun and a fair environment to have it in the movement is exciting and the community is refreshingly polite and helpful it s fairly easy and efficient to grind out valuable items that other players will buy for premium currency so even the most luxurious mtx cosmetics are within reach i do feel a small monetary investment i ve paid 5 so far is necessary to feel comfortable but that is a necessary evil of funding a game like this the decisions of the dev team can be questionable but the core gameplay is solid just expect the usual devs plz ordeal and trust that the overall direction is stable and positive overall i give it an 8 10 it s far from perfect but for a free or very cheap game it s a heck of a time i still enjoy logging in and killing 4 grineer with one arrow while spreading toxic spores over entire maps and that s enough reason for me to keep playing
