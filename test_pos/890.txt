2022 this game reminded me how much i missed exploring an immense open world and how gaming industries have lowered my standards over the years no unnecessary guidances no go and pick some flowers to craft healing portions constantly no warnings the only thing the game requires is people to explore this open world beautifully written i dont think i will be obssesed with a game like this for a long time
