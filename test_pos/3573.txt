2018 unlike the majority of the negative reviewers i bought gta v not gta online the game gta v is a lot of fun the world is big and colourful the characters are ok i really didn t care about any of their lives much and the story is enough to keep me going the radio is not as good as earlier ones too much stupid music not enough legitimately funny ads shows etc the tv was ok in this but kind of bland i play gta for the rpg experience of a deeply satirical and sarcastic world view of the one we live in and this one simply didn t deliver as before beautiful graphics fun to play it s worth the price especially on sale to obtain and enjoy gta v i can t review gta online because i didn t care about it i tried it didn t really enjoy the mini games and heists i think it s made for a niche crowd probably the kind who get aggressive over nothing hits on someone s sister coldly rebuffed which he deals with as an emotionally stunted individual then demands the blunt hurry up and be passed this person also vows that people on x box live will be dealt with in real life because they don t know him this person is probably also going to rage at me because i don t know how evil rockstar is for taking his money by making it hard to free play online but that s because i only gave them enough money to play the game i wanted gta v
