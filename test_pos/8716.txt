2019 this app is amazing i never knew what i was missing before i had it i ve probably spent more time watching all of my different wallpapers than actually playing games since i got it the previews in the store do not do the massive workshop library justice there are some very long and high quality loops as well as fully customizable audio visualizers that will make you hate static wallpapers for the rest of your life it s super easy to manage as well it becomes a hidden icon that you can right click to either pause or stop super helpful whenever you need all your ram
