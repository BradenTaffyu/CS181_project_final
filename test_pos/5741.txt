2015 ok so the interface with uplay is kinda buggy and when my roomate picked up the game it took us like 5 10 min to get partied up and start playing then it happened that first time you are hangin up side down off a 3 story building and you get a head shot on a guy through a bullet hole in a barricade and then you kick off and come swinging in to drop your shield and take fire from three other enemys while your team breaches from all angles to drop them in a blink of an eye thats when it is 20 hours later and you are trying to figure out why the sun is going back down lvl 27
