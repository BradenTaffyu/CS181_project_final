there is a limit to how much inconvenience and unfriendliness can be dressed up as something idealized it s unreasonable to call presenting an incomplete product from which many necessary aspects for enjoying the game have been removed a philosophy at this price point it s difficult to recommend the game with a light heart setting aside discussions about dlcs or game systems the most disappointing aspect was how many quests and stories felt incomplete or ended abruptly the most enjoyable moments occurred when i ventured off the beaten path to explore away from my backlog of quests however even these enjoyable experiences were often disrupted by inconveniences and an unfriendliness disguised as idealized or philosophical ultimately this recommendation is very precarious leaning strongly towards not recommending the game as i continued writing i found myself listing only the drawbacks nevertheless i recommend this game because i believe the fun it offers even if just a little outweighs the drawbacks
