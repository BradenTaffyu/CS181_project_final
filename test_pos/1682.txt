2022 some dubious performance issues and some crashes yet to be fixed but i m sure that will be ironed out in time unit rosters are also sparse compared to previous releases but mods will fix that on to the good stuff huge improvements to co op campaign including simultaneous turns diplomacy and siege maps are dramatically improved the game itself is generally better in every regard definitely worth it now or a little later with some patching if you prefer to wait for rough patches to be smoothed out to suffer is to love the god bear for kislev and ursun
