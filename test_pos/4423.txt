2015 lotus its the grineer the grineer tennnooo scooom the long story but make it short space future ized tech alien and robot enemies slicey dicey swords a mind bending storyline that will make you think the public school system failed your critical thinking and physics skills what else do you need the long story played this game since before there was even an orbiter and your home screen was actually just the star chart they ve made an incredible amount of player centered content and story additions since that time and de gets a 10 10 from me pros good gameplay nice graphics so many customization options p s runs amazing on the steamdeck oled one of the nicest gaming communities known to human kind and the devs actually care about us im crying right now actually really free to play if you want something you can earn it for free instead of buying with platinum you might have to do a ridiculous amount of stuff to earn it for free cough cough voidrig but its possible at first i was really confused by the dormizone love that update and deimos world additions thinking those could ve been totally separate games but now i understand really detailed story de good job tying everything together cons nightweave missions 1000 street cred a relatively small amount if you do this one mission no one likes 9 times
