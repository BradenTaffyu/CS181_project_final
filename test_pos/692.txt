no wonder cs is 20 years old this game is so addictive i was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion this is one of the most accurate fps games ever made with 128 tick servers this game requires passion dedication hardwork skill a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun rumours say cs go is going to shift on source 2 engine within 2 weeks really excited for it when you will play on low tier like silver gold nova you may lose many games because of your teammates they may do basic mistakes like run gun team flash etc but never rage on them always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners i know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm make sure to teach the beginners our community is already toxic lets not make it more you win or you learn you never lose cs will never die
