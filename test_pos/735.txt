ive been playing cs go since 2016 i sadly lost my old account the game was always a bliss ever since i started playing this october with the release of cs2 the game was bad for at least 3 weeks to a month after the hitbox bugs and weird peeks were fixed the game even tho less smooth became good again on the other hand cheaters are literally partying in this game wallhacks are everywhere and it seems like the vac live is blind overall the game is great and i reccomend it to anyone who likes esports and doesnt get frustraded when he dies all the time
