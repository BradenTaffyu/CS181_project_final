2019 early access review been looking forward to this one for a while these are my first impressions from a guy who has loved nolla games output since crayon physics deluxe and loves roguelites in general first bear in mind that this game is mega early access at the time of writing this there are numerous elements that need polish such as fullscreen windowed pretty much just being standard fullscreen and so on the game is plenty playable or at least it was on my rig and runs very well especially considering its main gimmick speaking of yes the gimmick is awesome my concern with this game was that nolla games would just lean back on the gimmick and then just make a generic roguelite off it but no they really exploited this to the max and i am so happy here s just a small taste of what you can do with this system maul bodies to cover yourself in their blood to put out a fire light a gigantic gunpowder container on fire to burn the gunpowder and cause a cascading downwards explosion as a kind of artificial drill position an oil barrel by kicking it then pierce the barrel to create an oil jet out of it to fill up a pit of enemies with oil then shoot a lantern above to fall down into the oil and set it all on fire melt snow into water and then boil it into steam which can get a little chaotic in the snow zone where most of the environment is snow and iceevery single pixel is simulated and that really does add to the game on top of that enemies drop twice the loot if you kill them with the physics system instead of just relying on your normal weapons which is great speaking of though the wands these are also really awesome equipment is in two categories wands and items and you can carry 4 of each items are just that and don t do more than what they say on the tin but between each zone wands can be customised and the customisation system is very deep just on my first playthrough i quickly assembled a wand that fires a magic arrow that bounces once and upon hitting a target or a second wall it leaves behind an imminently exploding mine that blasts in a vertical cross shape and a constantly burning wand that can indeed set fire to stuff at close range passively but can also shoot a rolling fireball that s honestly more like a grenade launcher that resurrects everything it kills the customisation system is difficult to describe but i ll try each wand has a set of specific stats unique to that wand like how many spells it can hold how quickly it can fire its mana cap and so on however the actual spells it fires aren t set in stone and you can shuffle them around between the zones buy new spells for your collection ecetera you can strip wands for their spells then discard them or pick up empty wands with no spells because said wand might have really good stats so next floor you can make your b f g the spells themselves and their order determine the behaviour of the wand for example you might have your basic starter wand that s setup is 2 spark bolt so it fires two small bolts in succession and then reloads but if you apply a y shape behind those spark bolts it ll shoot those two bolts at the same time in a cone pattern instead there s also the items themselves which are mostly potions essentially some liquid that you can toss out at a moment s notice when you need to you can even drop potions and shoot them to create a barrel like leak effect spray a small amount of it at foes or just toss the whole thing and potion effects vary from teleporting anything in the liquid to a random location in the zone or turning anything into a sheep or literally just being lava and the liquid lingers so you d better make sure you don t need to traverse where you throw a potion or you might just be doing it as a sheep some other things to note that might affect your purchase decision noita currently has no progression system as far as i know beyond a discovery catalogue of the things you ve found i actually don t see this as a particularly bad thing as i m used to experiences like spelunky where your starting tools are essentially all the tools you ll ever get but if you really need goals to be working towards in a roguelite beyond simply improving your own skills you won t find it here at least not for the time being i think it s likely something will likely be added in the future like at the least different unlockable colour schemes for your wizard perhaps different starting loadouts or even new characters but not yet noita is definitely a more slow paced roguelite which is pretty unique in the genre while noita does have moments of action even these are slower than a lot of other roguelites and dealing with enemies well is more about planning and strategy than combat itself once again early access so while the game is very playable and very fun it s still something to keep in mind
