2020 when i first heard about this game i thought it was a clone of friday the 13th that would die off in a matter of months and noone would ever hear about it again personally i ve seen gameplay of friday the 13th and was not impressed moreso skeptical about balance and fun for both sides this skepticism carried over to dead by daylight and i ignored it on steam and brushed it off as a game i would never play then a few years later my friend came to me saying hey check this game out it s so cool and of course i brushed it off until i watched him play what i saw was not a buggy mess like friday the 13th but a genuinely fun and well made horror action game so i picked it up and was immediately hooked i wanted to learn everything about it how to get good as survivor killer how to counter and mindgame i was fully sucked in the atmosphere and basic gameplay are amazing and when i first started i felt very immersed into the trials i was in all was great and dandy until i played online up to this point i only played custom games with the friends that got me into it where we all played relatively fair with no mori s or keys etc so once i played online with randoms i came face to face with the games issues balance if there s one thing that sums up the major problems with this game it s this either side can if they choose to make the game horribly unfair and unfun for the other side all because the developers have chosen to keep the explosive options in the game so they community community comes up with their own honor code with strategies perks and offerings that are so powerful people don t use them only problem is not everyone honors it and of course the code varies from player to player and blah blah blah quick solution balance the game some killers power s could also be buffed or nerfed and like 90 of perks are useless and the 10 people use are super powerful however you can get some amazing close games with both sides not bringing their explosive options or playing customs with friends where you dictate the rules overall 10 10 if everyone avoids the explosive options or the devs finally removes them4 10 when you get moried 2 mins in after getting tunneled also you can now kick babies in the ptb so if you re into that sort of thing
