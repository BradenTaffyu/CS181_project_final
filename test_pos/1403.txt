2022 absolutely loving the game people are having stuttering issues because of the day one patch screwing things up its unfortunate but fromsoft is aware and will fix it within the week that being said i have not been plagued by theses issues and this is by far the best souls game ive played and im only 7 4 hours in at the time of righting the atmosphere is amazing the combat is fast and deliberate i personally could not be happier and i know this is going to quickly eat up my life im 8 hours in and have seen roughly 40 enemy types not including bosses have killed only the first boss and only explored the first map area its gonna be a long one boys strap in dont listen to the hate give it a week and itll be early game of the year contender edit gonna be game of the year and i absolutely cannot wait for dlc
