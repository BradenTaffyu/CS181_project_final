ah yes lies of peniswho else s penis has been lying to them their whole lives a game so hard it will cure your erectile dysfunction lies of p is bloodborne meets sekiro meets twinkified pinokio my wife calls it pinocchioborne bloodnocchiro is my wife s boyfriend preferred term whichever comparison may actually be more accurate i m just glad that with this game we are now one step closer to a jack and the beanstalk souls like let s be honest the only reason we got this was because we were too depressed at not being able to throw our money at bloodborne still this game in my opinion is one of the few masterpiece level games that have come out in recent years from the beginning lies of p had me so in love and invested that i m almost addicted to just every part of this game lies of p is probably the first that apes bloodborne so blatantly that actually succeeds it s really really well done it s the strongest souls like not made by fromsoft i ve ever played the animation quality weapon feedback level design even if much more linear than anything from fromsoft enemy design just feels right they took everything great about from software games and then added their own unique flare to it this is how you do a clone correctly i never felt that with any other souls like and i tried nioh 1 and 2 mortal shell and other souls clones but they just don t hit that spot that fromsoft does but lies of p i just want to keep playing it s just that good to me aside from being an excellent iteration on the souls like formula this game really does seem to have a soul despite us playing as a puppet it sounds clich but lies of p literally feels like dark souls bloodborne and sekiro had a baby it could have been an absolute mess of borrowed mechanics that don t work well together yet somehow they incorporated the fast dodging and health rally mechanic inside a victorian nightmare of a setting from bloodborne while presenting an alternative parry prosthetic play style and tight action adventure storyline reminiscent of sekiro without ignoring the true underlying influence of the equipment level and boss design that s classic souls and honestly i liked this more than almost every souls like to date with the exception of bloodborne it feels like they ve added every qol improvement that those games could ve sorely benefited from every detail of this game s design was well done where i usually find myself shouting at souls games because of the bulls t for the sake of it elements i almost never found myself frustrated when playing this one lies of p takes the tale of pinocchio and cleverly twists the story into something much darker even weaving in other fairy tales some of which are almost guaranteed to be dlc made into a sequel classic fairytales re told as a soulslike is an amazing idea and whoever came up with this idea for lies of p is a genius the story is excellent and the characters are actually really well done there s enough story up front that you don t have to spend time reading several item descriptions to get even a surface level story there s direction and purpose to your actions and progress characters feel far more connected to the story and have a bigger direct impact on the plot if you want more backstory there s a ton to find i ve never been more invested in a game of this style and that s explicitly because of how i didn t have to go through pages of item descriptions to learn even basic principles about the world and characters the level design is very similar to demon s souls each level is self contained but some levels have branching paths within that level it s also very corridor driven like the souls games not as open as wo long sekiro or elden ring the stage design is absolutely marvelous though and i think the devs over at neowiz really know what they re doing there s this one enemy you first meet early on as a midboss it s imposing has high defense and will probably take a couple tries to beat for this first fight the devs give you lots of space a short run from the bonfire and it doesn t respawn much later on they reintroduce the enemy as a standard enemy and it comes in a much smaller space with reinforcements if you re like me you ll sh t yourself when seeing it with friends and run back to think about what to do but after calming down you ll probably take care of it without much trouble having learned the fight strategy earlier on after this refresher a few minutes later they put it on a narrow walkway with instant death chasms on both sides with almost nowhere to dodge but see it feels fair because the game just reminded you how to fight it excellent stage design the enemies are pretty simple but how they build up the complications systematically is top of class and shows great confidence in game design i was also so relieved about the linearity of the game i am very tired of open worlds being open worlds jut for the sake of being open worlds i ve recently played a few focused linear games and realized i had missed them so very much linearity gives you the pleasure of having moments filled with meaning at all times versus just meandering about until you find something enjoyable the combat is just as fluid as your tears will be combat feels great weapons are super fun to use and the grip handle system is quite clever though it could do a bit more to encourage customization and bosses are few in number but generally pretty fun memorable and decently challenging there were maybe three or four encounters that i found super challenging but eventually got through them by just getting better at parrying i do feel like the parrying system was better than dark souls but not as clean as sekiro s though bosses feeling fair is what probably stuck out the most to me with this game i can t think of a single fight that actually annoyed me and they all felt fair and their designs all felt tight contrast that against like the godskin duo in elden ring which had me ripping my pubes out in anger for days when i died in this one i pretty obviously had screwed up when i succeeded it was because i finally learned to dodge left you stupid idiot oh my god why did you bother with college if you re not capable of learning jack sh t jesus christ stop trying to block that he s going to kil aaaaand you re dead are you happy now i also really enjoyed learning all of their moves and figuring out which ones you should parry which you should dodge and which you should avoid via spacing beating bosses like the king of puppets and laxasia the complete had me on the edge of my seat and it also has the honor of having one technically two of the only good gank bosses in soulslike history in the end the setting music visuals and tight polish makes this game a pure pleasure to me and has emboldened me to really try harder on other souls like games so i cannot express vehemently enough how much i adored this one as i feel it has literally opened up a whole new avenue of enjoyment for me lies of p could be mistaken for a fromsoft production and that s one of the highest praises i could think there is for the game and what the developers set out to make it is a project that is what it claims to be the game is pretty much bloodborne s aesthetic and dodges sekiro s block and parry and demon s souls level design if you re a fan of the souls genre then this game is a no brainer and you will definitely enjoy playing it 10 10
