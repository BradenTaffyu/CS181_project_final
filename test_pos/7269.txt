great game great successor to the first game as somebody with 500h movement a bit clunky worse than in the first enemy variety in general isn t great otherwise very enjoyable ran perfect no crashes microtransactions absolutely irrelevant you can get pretty much everything in the game very easily you wouldn t even know they re there if there wasn t such a big fuss around them
