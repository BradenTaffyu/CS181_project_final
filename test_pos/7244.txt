okay i wasn t going to post a review originally but i feel that this hate train has gone on long enough so i m throwing my two cents in not for the people who are convinced they hate the game already but for those who look at the countless negative reviews and wonder what in the world is going on i m going to try and be as unbiased as i possibly can here and weather you want to take what i say to heart or throw it all in the trash is on you i also don t do tl drs you ve been warned i ve spent a little over 800 hours in this game gone through about 6 and a half playthroughs with the main goal of getting all the gear i felt i would want before i stopped and first i want to say that i enjoyed it did i enjoy everything no just like every game in existence and every future game it has it s problems people need to understand that first and foremost before going on a smear campaign for months on end complaining about the same things some them being just plain silly and most likely started by whiny keyboard warriors with nothing else to do but tell everyone else what to do with their money and if you disagree with anything they say then you re just dumb i just want to say don t let anyone tell you what to do with your own money and don t believe everything you hear on the internet that goes for this review as well take what everyone says with a grain of salt take people s opinions into consideration but the ultimate decision is yours don t be a sheep and blindly follow what people tell you with that said let s begin let s start with the price one of the main hot topics i don t think anyone can deny that this game is pretty darn expensive but the real question is is it worth it well from the hours and repeated playthroughs i have put into this game at full price honestly no i don t think it s worth it at 15 25 off i would say it s fine but even though i like the game enough to sink a lot of hours into it there just isn t enough here to warrant full price i say wait for a sale with the aforementioned discount if you have the patience for the people who say they won t buy the game for more then 30 all i can say is have fun waiting a few years might as well just forget about the game all together at that point if you re going that far because that s just not realistic when the game is only a few months old at the time of writing this review despite what people want you to think the game sold very well and capcom has no reason to lower it so low another thing that has been disputed time and time again is the performance of the game it s been talked about so much that i m frankly sick of it at this point is it that much of a problem honestly it depends on who you ask and what kind of rig they have everyone is different some people won t play a game that can t at least hit 60fps which is fine some people won t play a game unless they can run it with unlimited frames which is also fine still others straight up can t get the game to run at all which is not fine and others like myself can t get it to run more than 30 fps everyone is different but i ll say that on my end i still enjoyed my time with it despite the 30fps this isn t the first game i ve played with bad frame rate i like to see myself as a patient man and the game was playable enough for me to 100 the game so the frame rate didn t make the game unplayable of course it was not the best it could be but it was playable enough to be fun i know not everyone will think that way but to each their own there s more i could talk about but this review has gone on long enough i m just tired of hearing complaints from entitled people who expect every game to be flawless at launch every time so yeah don t be apart of the hate train please especially if you don t even have the game for goodness sake also take a good hard look before you judge something or just have a little patience before you go slinging around hate i just hope this review makes a least one person take a step back and reevaluate things
