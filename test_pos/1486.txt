2023 i finally had secured all of the empire under my banner and the vast nation of men towered as the strongest faction of the realm secured to the south by the treaties held with the various mighty dwarven kingdoms that stood between men and the undead to the west by the great ocean beyond which the proud elves mainly desired to be left to their own devices and to the east kislev the formidable ally to the empire stood guard against the orc threat thus i led the armies of men on a glorious campaign to battle the forces of chaos in the north that had been plaguing the realm with unrelenting incursions for as long as history had been written how could i have even suspected that without the slightest hint of their betrayal the entirety of the dwarven tribes would suddenly unite and in the same breath declare all of mankind their enemy turn their combined armies around and start ever marching north with nothing to stop them but hastily erected voewfully inadequate walls manned by whatever had been deemed unfit to battle chaos as the empire now lies in rubble with its remnants holding out on its few remaining islands the once glorious army of men being only a shadow of its former self let this be a cautionary tale to those of you who ever consider turning their backs on a dwarf but then again i am immortal after all so dwarfen scum in this life or the next prepare to pay for the sins of your forefathers
