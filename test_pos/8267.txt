2020 early access review now here is yet another breakthrough in gaming a roguelite that teases simplicity yet delivers far more complexity then you could ever get through and to top it all off it s still in beta if you are considering this game at all i would happily say go for it here s the thing yeah starting off it will be frustrating it will be difficult it will be down right unfair but after that you have probably one of the best payoffs ever in gaming you ll start to anticipate enemies you ll learn their attacks and range you ll discover ridiculously powerful spell combinations you ll find hidden areas you hadn t seen in your other 300 playthroughs you will become insanely powerful and die to something insanely stupid but just one of those times you just might not and when that happens you just might understand why i love this game so much
