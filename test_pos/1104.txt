i have spent hours in both the base game and dlc here are my thoughts i am in no way a hardcore player this is the only game i have ever played by this company this game pissed me off so much because i didn t understand that is was out the box a difficult game i have since then completed 100 of the achievements and got through the dlc the dlc is rough but if you you just want to progress and beat bosses with ease there are options spirit summons youtube cheese videos i enjoy exploring i love the graphics and sometimes i want the challenge of a boss however i have completed the game made it enjoyable on my terms and don t care if i don t kill the boss without a summons i don t get paid to play games so i take advantage of everything i can find and do in the game to go from point a to b i recommend the base game and the dlc i looked at the dlc as how can i defeat and cheese the new bosses not how do i learn the mechanics so people will know i am a good player i just don t care i want to beat the game start to finish if i can do this and i am not a good player then spend the money and beat it your way in anyway you see fit
