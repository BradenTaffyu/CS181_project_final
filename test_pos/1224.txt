2022 this game is amongst my top 3 favourite souls like games the open world innovation definitely takes a positive step in this direction and does not hold the player s hand for guidance the boss design level design in certain areas and the soundtrack make the entire experience very memorable the build variety is unlike any souls game released and you will most likely find a build out there that suits your play style 9 10here are my pros and cons for elden ring pros amazing soundtrack throughout the entire game bosses are incredible in terms of design and spectacle legacy dungeon areas are perfect with tons of exploration being possible as well was some being non linear main progression route has flexibility on what the player decides to do which is a great feeling massive variety of builds to use which all feel unique and fun some being stronger than otherscons it can be easy to over level early on due to the map being open world kind of expected and can t be fixed many of the catacombs or caves will re use bosses which can feel repetitive the open world areas can sometimes feel empty but this isn t massively noticeable occasional lag spikes when going through areas caelid leyndell etc overall an amazing game to play definitely give it a try
