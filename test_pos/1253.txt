after much thought i have to crown this the best game ever made to date while i still hold other games in high regard throughout gaming history legend of zelda mario and mass effect series for example elden ring is the pinnacle of gaming for me the extreme depth of build variety game play art map layout and lore is unmatched it is not perfect no game is in my opinion but this is as close to perfection as it gets for me
