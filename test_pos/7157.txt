2015 call of duty been a fan of the games title for years since mw till mw3 and after that it got worse and worse because the series became a yearly which feels like the same idea over and over again sadly now let s talk about call of duty black ops 3 s cons and pros pros parkour system the graphics are awesome the soundtracks are pretty good zombies customize characters and different abilities for each character you choose cons bad port to pc race which brings some memory issues and massive fps drops especially to i5 processors the zombies have only one map and if you join sessions you ll have crazy lags the story is again in the future about robots and special robotic suits personaly i dont like it so i think this game does not worth the 60 price at least not in this shape if treyach manages to fix the issues of the game and make it more stable it would probably worth the 30 s bucks
