2014 both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire steam library cs go has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly as i ve enjoyed over hundreds of hours playing this joyous game from the teamwork player rankings campaigns competitive gameplay music replay value and much more this game is a king amongst most modern multi player fps games and still going strong even over just a measly three years just like its predecessors the player assumes the role of either a counter terrorist or a terrorist both with their own unique missions depending on the campaign in general the newly added campaigns deathmatch and arms race is a great exclusive extra if you re just a casual player whereas there s the competitive session for the more experienced intense and determined players out there with every match starting you re brought into freeze time where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal just ready to be bought either with the money you ve earned by killing opponents or indeed losing a match respectively still giving the losing team a winning chance while with your team you could stick together as there are power in numbers or go alone to face your opposing enemies i wouldn t talk for every individual player out there as i ve seen power in experienced players trust me i have witnessed a russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents all in the same vicinity and yes he was a rageful one indeed i also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments definitely pushing the source engine to its absolute limits but doesn t go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game the gameplay the gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect as you can easily navigate along with the controls are fast and sometimes responsive on the other hand the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious numbered team just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming as it does help much more the original music used is also a big step up as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match each time around from the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is and with an added bonus with the steam music player at its peak in popularity the update with the musical kit useable in game was a great move as you can listen to classic music as you slaughter your opponents joyfully i ve also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real life history and origin in a very formal informative and creative way the statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second hand pistols when reloading your main gun that takes precious time along with how they flesh out damage with a great controlled accuracy as you can tell this game serves many different ideas strategies preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other and yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple yet fast updates the homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest cs go news such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe or special deal offers on those elusive cases if you re ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins you can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back but my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be the community yes a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional but i m not talking about those great people i m talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning kruger affect where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players in a much more biased fashion it gets annoying pretty quickly so i would usually block the most revolting swines who do this all in all this game is a big big big recommendation from me and if you think i m lying just check top selling games list at the start of the steam page there s a reason why this game is on the high ranking list and that s due to its high and successful popularity
