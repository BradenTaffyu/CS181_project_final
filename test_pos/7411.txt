keep in mind that with all of these reviews you never know who or what kind of person wrote them so they might aswell be a complete idiot that did not play the game or they re someone along the lines of a video game journalist as such i want to tell you that i have hundreds of hours of playtime in the first game across multiple systems xbox switch pc and was quite a fan of it s unique albeit unpolished gameplay but even then i was only sold on it once the game started opening up which is when you beat it so i let me preface this by saying i do want you to try this game as i greatly enjoyed it and yes i am biased but there are points in this game that left even me wanting specifically endgame has performance issues ranging from minor to medium i tested it on multiple setups on the one im sticking with rx6600 ryzen 7 5800x3d it runs smoothly at 60fps high ultra settings sans stuttering in one city that i literally havent visited in the last 20 hours of playtime which accounts for 50 of my first playthrough that solely being the major city in the first region bakbattahl and the minor settlements and the open world all run really well personally i didn t mind one bit as it never impeded me in playing the game as you almost never fight in the city though the fps issues there still really need to be improved upon it s really not an acceptable state but you can live with it i really don t get why people say the performance makes it unplayable do you run a 1050ti 2017 ryzen in 2024 or what it might be that this game greatly benefits from the 5800x3ds cache though no idea as for the gameplay i think it improved upon flaws the first game had and gave it some much needed quality of life no more running all the way to gran soren to swap out your skills as a mage because all of them are simply not fit for fighting the specific enemy you re going to encounter as you can change skills while camping now it really wonderfully ties in into the exploration because that s what you ll constantly want to be doing as you play through it i had to often remind myself to not keep exploring for 4 hours at a time and get some progress on the main story in the first game you often would lament playing melee because of flying enemies i found this not to be as big an issue in this game as the melee vocations vertical attacks gained some range so unlike the first game i wasn t just standing around waiting for my pawn to do it for me but actually leaping into the air and beating them myself this game is perhaps the closest thing there is to what i d want to a dnd experience as an action rpg the combat travelling and exploration aswell as the ways things can get messy really make it feel that way for me if there s anything bad i would have to say about it that would be that combat while it does have some weight to it it feels as though the first game had more to it and i miss that feeling i would like to speak about the difficulty of the game but i as someone who is experienced with these games cannot tell a potential buyer the game is too easy it is a little tough in the beginning but you lose that feeling after 10 or so levels and then only drakes and lesser dragons will seem imposing to you however they will seem that way for a while even ogres still mess up you up if they get you good later on however it certainly doesn t feel as esoteric as the first game and that i miss mystic knight fighter even though it got some skills from the class just isn t quite the same without the seal orb cannon i don t think the game is particularly unfinished or untested and anyone who says so didn t play the game but rather that people had high expectations for something that was never going to be more than dragon s dogma 1 2 and honestly i blame ecelebs in part but that s capcom digging their own grave if there is something that i disliked about the game it would solely be the post game content i already had expectations as to what would happen in postgame due to dragon s dogma 1 so i probably wasn t as surprised as someone who would experience it for the first time again in that regard this is really just the first game all over again but it s missing something akin to the everfall from the first game if this game would receive dlc or atleast something akin to the first games dark arisen i believe that would make me strongly recommend it to everyone instead of only strongly recommending it to people that enjoyed the first game and even those will have one or two bad things to say about it people like and dislike games for different reasons after all i think it s really funny that people complain about the microtransactions as they re on the same level of buying red orbs for dmc v if you even think of buying them there s something wrong with your head i sincerely believe they just put them in to satisfy some capcom suit that really wanted mtx and they put these in knowing noone will buy these though i wish getting the first games ost available for this game wasn t mtx either i can somewhat understand why it would be the same people that complain about mtx here readily spend 20 bucks for cosmetics in other games by the way they wouldn t be here if people didn t keep buying them this sort of thing is why this is so prevalent everywhere should ve gotten used to it cause this is the future you chose there s a reason why fans of the first game kept chanting stuff among the lines of dragon s dogma is the worst game i have ever played i love it it was never for everyone especially not with what the avg modern gamer wants but i think with just a little more it could be for everyone
