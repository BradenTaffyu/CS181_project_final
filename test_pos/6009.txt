2018 i want to start by advising you to take the recent negative review burst with a pinch of salt the game has been rebalanced a bit and a vocal minority of the community feel less powerful this has ruined the game for them i would say the changes are amazing and expand the viable options available which makes for a more varied and interesting game this is a great asymmetrical pvp i ve had a lot of fun both surviving and hunting it s been a really unique experience for me if you like being startled and fancy a solid horror challenge this game is great don t get me wrong it won t be for everyone sometimes you ll lose and there s nothing you can do about it sometimes as killer you ll be up against four survivors who wreck you and rub it in your face the whole game sonetimes as survivor you ll be hooked in minutes with no chance to escape along with the asymmetry this can create vocal cliques of whiny survivor or killer mains if you will be upset about not feeling powerful this may not be your game if you like the premise and can lose with a bit of maturity i d bet you ll love it
