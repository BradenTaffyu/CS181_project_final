2017 absolutely love the game but ofcourse there are flaws not gonna say its the community or op killers but a major glitch in the system the whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch and how to fix it today my data 58 hours of gameplay was completely reset while playing i got a connection error then a message saying the season has ended when i went to check out my characters they were all level one now to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game here s a fix step 1 go to the location of your steam data then your dead by daylight save which in my case is os c program files x86 steam userdata 129389900 381210 remote profilesaves step 2 copy the file located within profilesaves to a safe location i leave it directly on my desktop optional step 3 make a shortcut to your profilesaves folder and place on desktop for easy access step 4 update your save copy save and replace everytime you close the game if you dont do this you could lose hours of progress like i did today i lost about 4 hours of progress good luck to you noobies and have fun because this game is amazing
