2022 it s 2022 and the price of this game is insane but that s corporate greed for you anyway call of duty black ops 3 has the best zombie mode compared to all the other cods the workshop mods are a lot of fun and i find myself constantly downloading new zombie maps everyday the best part of zombies is that you can look up servers in game that are using custom zombie mods which makes the game even more fun i do not recommend buying this game for multiplayer because well its dead 100 the zombie community however is very much alive and lots of players still playing that whether its in on the server list or the actual zombie mode itself i do not recommend buying this game at 60 but if you ever see it on sale for 30 or less then sure it s a lot of fun and worth it as long as you re a zombie fan
