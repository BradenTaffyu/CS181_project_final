2017 early access review i purchased this software hoping it would return the same functionality dream scene live wallaper did in windows vista that was later removed for performance issues the truth is this software is what dream scene should have been and is far more complex and configurable then the official feature ever was i did a full review of this software at that will be published on 3 9 2017 at 6am pst i am in no way affiliated with the company that makes this program and purchased the program for full price from steam after discovering it i would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as i would love to speak to him her about some other features moving forward since i come from a software development background myself thank you jerry berg aka barnacules youtube 840k subscribers 91 million video views
