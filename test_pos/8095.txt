2021 noita is essentially for a particular set of players some people who play this game won t enjoy it i ve seen that happen particularly with streamers who like to play the no backseating way the game while not necessarily requiring you to search up information in order to perform some of the various side objectives or even to understand wand crafting for that matter does heavily require you to spend a considerable amount of time to fully comprehend the deep functions of much of the world the enemies the secrets the spells the wands the items even the bosses and when i say considerable i mean tens if not hundreds of hours of time spent even getting to that point requires a great degree of patience and persistence as ultimately the game is also random and a hiisi enemy could end up picking up a nuke wand killing you instantly i think that s where the greatest divide lies there is a mod on the workshop that allows the player to go through a series of basic and progressively complex wand spell puzzles and this is a concept that i greatly would have liked to seen in the base game but due to this being the last major update i doubt that will ever be the case no form of greater tutorial or help it could be deliberate but really at the end of the day this decision much like the majority of the game is very very obtuse it s jarring to a portion of players and it always will be especially for those that expect a true rogue lite experience i ve met people who think this is the greatest game they ve ever played and i ve met people who simply couldn t get into it it s a divisive project at heart and further on i don t think that will change maybe with noita 2 it will if you go into this don t expect hand holding but also don t let that hold you back exploit the world break it create a tool of destruction the likes of which the world has never known think of it mathematically think of ways to survive use the practice mode i guess though it s pretty out of context for new players i love the game i really do but i m not going to sit back and say everything about it is pitch perfect i m not even going to tell you that if you can climb the slope of early play that there s going to be a rainbow on the other side but i personally do enjoy it i enjoy a lot of the depth of the experience and i enjoy how crazy things can get whilst also making you come back to reality on your fragility every now and then noita while not being my favorite game of all time is a game i will never forget
