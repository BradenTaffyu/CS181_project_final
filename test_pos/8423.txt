in memory of a great writer carlo collodithat is the lyrics this game meets a player and i have to agree with that one because devs sure did a good job on the game and story they worked on now about my experience with the game and ups and downs of this game on the plus side very interesting story with some twists very cool bosses weapons and level design a memorizable characters and interesting story telling of pinnocio very friendly ergo system you dont lose it all if you die second time like in soulsborne series and most of the soulslikes you just lost a part of it and with a certain upgrades of p organ you can make it so you lose even less interesting system of the p organ upgrades that makes you have locked abilitys and more heals etc hard to miss anything story wise unlike miyazaki and fromsoftware gamesfor the minus sides very weird curve difficulty i personally gave up on beating bosses alone and started to summon a specters around chapter 8 delayed hits yes elden ring also had such issues but not to such a scale unblockable red attacks that autoaims at the main character that is such a pain in the back that got myself burned a few times some of the abilities that should be in base game are blocked in p organ such as a good dodge that should not be a thing perfect parry i am not really a fan of the idea since i need to get that 0 5 second of a perfect block i wish the window were at least a bit bigger animations of some enemies and bosses sometimes they are so alike that its hard to tell if the enemy gonna do 1 hit or 3 true end boss not allowing me to summon a specter to fight it had to perfect the fight my personal issue through overall i will give that game a score of 8 out of 10 good almost perfect kinda like a bloodborne for pc we are all keep asking for lol but i wish the devs a good luck in their next project that should be in the same universe or the dlc for that game cant wait for those ones
