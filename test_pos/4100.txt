2018 this game is what modern 2017 2018 aaa titles should look up to the single player is extremely fun and the multiplayer is just as fun yes the online side of the game is quite grindy but the grind doesn t seem to bore me which makes this game a gem there are hackers and there are plenty of modders but please don t make that influence your decision as you can create a private online session i give this game a 9 5 10
