2017 the basic concept of competive counter strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years 5 terrorists and 5 counter terrorists fight each other in order to detonate defuse bomb or eliminate entire enemy team to win same old story but everything is polished to a perfection you usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes when playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly cs go servers are really stable and i have never experienced a server or game crash if one players happens to quit drop crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot this is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100 sure lost there are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive i strongly suggest atleast trying arms race and demoliton modes they offer far more easy going less stressful and quicker game sessions counter strike has always been all about teamplay playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast paced you get most out of this game when you are playing with friends most of the cs go community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing bullying insulting and bad sense of humor pretty much in every single game with strangers i have played counter strike since 1999 and playing cs has never been as easy smooth as it is today with cs go easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans history lesson just to point out how easy competive match making is made in cs go i tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000 s first you had to gather 5 friends to play sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players because everyone had to be part of the same clan team you couldn t play with strangers after that you had to go to a specific irc chat channel to find your opponents 5 mins if you had a server of your own up to an hour if you didn t then you confirmed the match with your opponents at clanbase a site that keep track with clans teams wins and losses finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server use console command to start recording your gameplay in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating and start playing after the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning history 10 perfect game9 excelent game best of the genre8 good game worth your time7 average game nothing really special6 bad game avoid5 painful to play completely waste of time4 failed game unpayable
