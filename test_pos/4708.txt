2023 nvm game wanna learn how to make atom bomb first a phd level of training in metallurgy to determine all of the different metals and alloys needed to fabricate the parts of the bomb phd level training in nuclear physics to determine exactly what isotopes and how much will be needed and of course exactly in what shape they will be needed a phd level of training in explosives to determine what type and how much explosive will be needed for the various non nuclear parts of the bomb a tool and die level of expertise as a machinist to fabricate the parts correctly for the bomb so far all of these areas of expertise are readily available a couple of lifetimes of study will get you there naturally you will also need a very nice machine shop to fabricate your device now comes the more difficult part getting fissile material this type of material is usually available only from nation states i have checked at walmart and they didn t seem to stock it so buying enough is going to be a problem a big problem a very big problem in fact an insurmountable problem fissile material is much better protected than gold and many times more expensive so even if you can overcome the various expertise requirements you will have a very very big problem getting the fissile material however that is just one of many problems i will leave to the ambitious bomb maker to solve were you to decide to make your own fissile material you would need to decide whether to use u235 or pu239 in either case you will need many tons of uranium metal a purchase of which may draw the attention of various 3 letter agencies this will be a fundamental decision since they are made in completely different ways the u235 route will require thousands of ultra centrifuges with a huge power plant to run them while the pu239 will require a nuclear reactor both will require very large laboratories for the industrial separation of the different highly radioactive isotopes just a couple more problems for the inveterate bomb maker to solve it might also be noted that were you to somehow manage to acquire said fissile material there would be quite a number of agencies interested in how you got it where it is and just what you were planning to do with it the fbi cia mi5 kgb or whatever their current name is mossad and a few others come to mind these tend to be very unfriendly and also very curious their methods of getting answers may not be pleasant but since you will probably never be seen again after their visit i would consider that aspect your personal problem and again one for you to solve in due course so there are a few challenges to making your own home made atomic bomb however with enough determination and money you might succeed i don t recommend you try this at home though and don t forget your neighbors won t appreciate your testing it either
