actually one of the greatest games i ve ever played it s incredibly deep rewarding and much more expansive than it seems at first depending on your penchant for punishment and capacity for persistence going in blind could either be a great benefit or a hindrance to your immediate enjoyment of the game for me i tried playing noita a few times without knowing anything about it and kept bouncing off of it noita just seemed like another overly difficult roguelite admittedly one with cool physics and an intriguing modular spellcasting system however a few months ago i caught a youtube video the worst guide to noita that revealed a little more about what s just beneath the surface of noita getting a confirmation that noita had a lot more going on than i initially thought spurred me into giving it another shot it took me 60 hours and 112 deaths before i finally finished a run and now i m in the middle of an adventure to explore some of the more obscure and esoteric elements and mechanics hidden in noita anyways if you re like me and noita didn t initially hook you don t hesitate to spoil a little bit of what the game actually has in store for you it might motivate you to jump back in
