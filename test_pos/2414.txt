2020 if you have never played apex legends its essentially a multiplayer battle royale version of titanfall without the mechs and before anyone says nuh uhhh its not like titanfall it was literally made by the same developers and in the same game engine as titanfall anyway its a good game sometimes frustrating but overall if you like first person shooters and want something a little less childish than fortnite i highly recommend apex legends its free and all the battle pass does is get you cosmetic crap and allows you to pick more heroes but its no big deal
