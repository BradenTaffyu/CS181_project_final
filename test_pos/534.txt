2016 since the dawn of time i have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises the sky had no color food had no flavor after playing this truly amazing life altering of a game i can honestly say i m a changed man cs go has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub conscious this game has made a profound impact to me never before i felt like ripping another human beings head off uninstalling reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their cool skins i guess skin skill matters more i feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching fragging etc is unlike anything i ve experienced it takes me back to the good old cod4 gears of war battlefield days having clan battles either gb or underground rules blah blah blah a true fps that is fun for all ages for the casual players you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive you will def enjoy this from the your mom 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people this community is toxic as you d expect but from the smurf and hackers you ll either quit or keep on trying
