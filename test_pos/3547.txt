2015 it s the good ol gta what could go wrong exactly noticereview is only for the solo mode not the online gameplay a good cover system realistic movement and more guns are solid as you bet they hit and boy do they hit good shooting from vehicle s has been improved on driving and physics isn t bad personally i like them gps and map has been very improved a i has been improved on vast they will even flip you off lol many activities to do on tennis strip club lol golf cenima hang out marathons race events hunting and alot more many side quests and random missions many online mode only vehicles can be purchased from the internet vehicle customization is top notch amazingly detailed from cars to bikes each story mission is replayable from start to finish first person view makes shooting easier no difficulty options i love it makes it so that everyone haves the same challenges cool transition between switching characters it always shows what they were doing a moment before frist person fov is changeable smooth animations alot improved many many vehicles weapons and much more it s just enjoyable fun and really just impressive at times some deaths feel very unrealistically cheap the game may punish you for using different tactics in missions not all missions where you can enable that first person collusion s can get odd and bugged at times many mission s have poor briefing introduction with little or no info no access to eating food except just sodas and liquids air craft controls are odd and unsatisfying the a i can get wierd and bugged at times where a teamate will just be circling around each time a mission starts it sets the currently equipped weapon to whatever it feels like to thus adding a bit o frustration all your clothing and eyeware gets reset each time you start the game thus requiring to change them every time story amazingly directed funny serious amusing at times overall a great story it just keeps you wanting to play immersion due to it being realistic on many points of society very just detailed behind each missions there are belieble reasons it gave me many emotions some sad at times to what the characters do but i believe this was done on purpose and they made it right it shed alot of light on our society great great dialogue and voice actinggraphics very detailed environments objects and much more best lens flare and sun i have seen great skybox just so pleasing to look at beautiful beautiful scenery water wave s are just done right the best wide scale of options biggest yet i have seen explosion effects and more have been improved on option for benchmark greatly optimized no fps drops smooth 60 fps textures on low look like really ass now it s on low of course but hey come on when the system requirements are decently high wouldn t you expect more better textures many updates do tend to bring many stutter and fps problems design menu is simple as it could be and responsive in game art works are fully macthing and gta style death screens and alot more have been improved on map design is actually great while many generic buildings but overall big and beautiful just not many interiors as you would expect only buildings where you can do a activity are open while all the others are just pure dead sounds ost all environmental and effects sounds are a job well done from guns to vehicles from walking to riding a bike you can listen to your own music sound track is overall just amazing it builds up the mood from boredness to just pure action many radio stations and funny commercials plus commentry in total many many radio songs a big variety and good to listen while many just bad songs some even just made me laugh overall thoughts and points sound overall just pleasing from guns to vehicles many variety in songs 16 stations and good commentary while many just bad songs some being even just laughable design great design overall from map to menu while just not many accessible interiors story just amazingly well directed funny serious sad at times and a a notice on many points of our society graphics amazingly detailed environment and a great skybox plus over all effects great port smooth while bad textures on low and bad fps due to some updates gameplay overall improved upon just every aspect and many new stuff most just welly executed while some little problems but nothing game breaking a bit just pure fun as always the game has many many graphic torture disturbing or even offensive scenes violence is in many amounts here due to many loads of realism from nudity to well alot more online mode has script kiddies problem syou can get banned even with having solo mods on online some users have reported crash to desktop and such issues rockstar social club is required and it is glitched as hell many issues you must have internet connection to even start the game just dont expect a completely different game cause it s really as gta has been but with a heck load of tweaks and overhauls conclusionjust buy it already man and stop looking at me face in all seriousness i fully recommend this game it is down right fully worth that 60 dollar just heck load of improvements and new stuff great execution solid gameplay good optimization and beautiful graphics and scenery and alot alot more while some problems but not game breaking at all just throw demm dollas
