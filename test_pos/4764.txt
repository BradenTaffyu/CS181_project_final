this game is abusive its fun enough with friends to want to keep playing it but the sweats on top of the hit box mechanics when said sweats are jumping around is enough to make you wonder why you keep punishing yourself by continuing to play this game at the end of the day its a game you can hop on and play for 10 mins or for 3 hours and leave either frustrated or satisfied that you got in some good firefights or even got the dubs play at your own risk
