2023 apex legends is a battle royale game that has shown a fair amount of growth since its release in 2019 most battle royale genre games have fallen in popularity over the last couple of years but apex legends still holds a strong fan base this game builds off the titanfall universe for characters and story but combines it to a battle royale game with abilities for each character you play when starting off you get a fair amount of characters but it will take a long time before you earn all of them for free since this game is published through ea it s not surprising to see micro transactions being littered across the game with apex packs collection events and unlocking characters and weapon skins since the game is free to play this doesn t bother me as much because it s completely optional and you can earn characters and apex packs for free just not as many it is likely that if you invest time in the game you will feel like investing money too the gameplay for apex legends is pretty decent considering that this game is live service there are constant balance changes and updates with new characters and weapons to shake the meta up each season most characters have their strengths and weaknesses which is up to the player to decide which legend suits them best here are my personal thoughts on what apex is good at and bad at pros has constant updates and changes to make the game more interesting has a long term grind to work on with unlocking characters and levelling up to the max level 500 has fun moments with friends and is more fun when you take the game less seriously ltms during different times of the year are very fun to play usually have good incentive to earn rewards from playing them with character weapon skins trackers or badges cons matchmaking in terms of waiting time is quite long sometimes can be frustrating matchmaking in terms of who you match against in matches has been changed a ton which is making it seem like you are punished for playing well in public matches because you will immediately be matched with incredibly sweaty players next game ranked has seen a lot of changes to balance how lp is earned a point system based on match performance and this has seen huge issues in the past with players simply camping in zone to earn lp up to master predator ranks there is no playlist activity for solo vs solo players you are stuck with duo or trio due to the fact that apex legends is a teamworking based battle royale it would be nice to see a solo activity for players overall apex legends is a pretty well thought out game with plenty of content to play for no cost there are times where i have personally felt burnt out from playing due to the nature of the game being a battle royale it s definitely worth a try if you are interested in this genre but i wouldn t try it if you aren t into battle royale games
