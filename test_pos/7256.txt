at first i found the save system a bit odd and having pawns jump off cliffs or run into water to their doom really annoying but i persevered and began to learn the games mechanics and got really into playing with the different combat styles the story is a bit crap but the combat makes up for it and i didn t have any game breaking bugs performance was pretty good throughout as well definitely deserves better than mixed reviews on here 7 5 10
