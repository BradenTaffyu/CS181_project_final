2019 early access review don t get me wrong noita isn t a bad game which is the exact reason why i can t give it a negative review we just have to get few things straight this game is ridiculously hard and unforgiving after the first two caves you will need good spells perks and wands to succeed if you don t you will most likely die the enemies become so tough that simple 3 5 dmg spells just don t cut it lets talk about the enemies they have pinpoint accuracy later on the amount of them is just cruel and the damage is insane don t have a shield of some kind too bad they will rip you a new one they don t care if you are in a safe zone also called the holy mountain or not sometimes enemies will straight up bust into the safe room or they will form an army under the exit there are some mini bosses in the game whom will spawn minions to fight with them the bad thing is that there can be multiple of them in one cave and they spawn more minions every time you damage them one of my playthroughs ended because there was two mini bosses waiting for me when i jumped out of the safe room i managed to defeat the first two but not 30 seconds later third surprised me from behind a corner and shot me these situations don t feel too fair if you ask me perhaps i should have played better who knows but it s too late for that now also on the topic of shields the game is really rng heavy one thing you have to get used to is that most of your runs will end because r n jesus wasn t on your side maybe you didn t find any good wands or the shop didn t have anything worthwhile to use doesn t matter you can almost give up if you don t have anything when you get to cave three i m not suggesting that the devs should give us the best wands and perks right away what i mean is that the game should at least give you some kind of a chance instead of just screwing your sweet b tthole the first opportunity it gets so what do i think of noita i think it needs some balancing here and there the amount of mini bosses should be limited and the enemy zerging at the start of a cave should be stopped there is a reason why the game is in early access but as i stated at the beginning in my opinion the game is good there is so much more to do instead of the first cave you spawn in front of the world on the surface is filled with places to explore should you buy this game sure why not if you like hella challenge oh yeah i got a little hint for you be careful when you test new spells you are not familiar with and pay attention to the wands and how they function they can cost you your life
