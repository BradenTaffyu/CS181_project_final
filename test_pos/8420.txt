2023 i ll be making several required analogies to the soulsborne and sekiro games to highlight their similarities and differences fairly so since it attracts many characteristics and players from those games lies of p follows the story of the mischievous puppet pinocchio and craftsman geppetto involving many of the characters found in the books however apart from subtle expressions and meanings subtextually correlating with the books the game doesn t have too many direct connections to its source material i would argue the narrative of the game is far grimmer than any other adaptation possibly even so than the original book which i love especially in the context of a souls like game it s definitely a standout feature when picturing a contrast between lies of p and dark souls the former does not have the depths filled with lore or the presumptuous storytelling which leave many parts of the story up for interpretation nor does it have the intricate world building with that said it s still a fantastic piece the puzzle together story with great environmental storytelling and great dialogue it just has bigger pieces to fill in the empty slots and not as many missing ones which i believe to be for the best it allows casual players to better understand the interpretations of the writers without the need of reading 200 items descriptions watching 5 videos and making 3 reddit posts just to appreciate the lore of the game the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic the game has records which you can find and play there are not many but they are surely magical the first record you find and play titled feel really sets the tone and mood for the rest of the playthrough it may not have the orchestral brilliance of dark souls or bloodborne but it blends in with the story just as well alike dark souls every npc gets its own little fable perfectly woven into the fabric of the story each one portraying a different moral lesson very fitting seeing they are inspired by the animals from the book there are also window npcs with little quests but i feel they are not as interesting as the ones from bloodborne one small detail i enjoyed from certain windows you can hear people coughing animals barking and sometimes music been played showing that there are survivors in the abnormal world of lies of p the parrying is definitely not as intuitive as in sekiro fairly so in my opionion the enemies are not humans with ostentatious martial arts attacks they are puppets and insane monsters with crazy attacks so in a way is fitting however it still is very annoying to parry certain attacks they did make certain enemies attacks to be more intuitive i do not find the bosses or enemies to be as annoying as dark souls or any other souls like but the frustration is there and will differ for each person the level design is way too monotonous in dark souls you at least have some choices to avert and explore different roads lies of p is as linear as it gets there s not much depth to the design of the levels the game is a straight path with enemies put in the middle of it maybe it s simplistic design is more favorable to some people than a maze in which you can t find the exit the idea of combining weapons together it s probably my favorite mechanic instead of having 500 weapons of which you will only use 5 here you get like 30 you can combine the blade of a weapon with the handle of another weapon each having a different ability most handles do share the same abilities and overall making your own unique weapon legion arms are a prosthetic arm weapon with different abilities that you can upgrade but outside of cheesing certain mini bosses and enemies i found them to be mostly a novelty and not as usable as the prosthetic arms in sekiro i wish there was upgrades for the basic arm you first get that maybe would ve had more utilities the other mechanic of the game called wish cubes another devastatingly pointless novelty you would mainly use them for summons that help with bosses but the summons are just as useless as the cube itself there are 2 types of leveling systems one requires ergo echoes souls your usual level up system and the other one requires quartz which further upgrades your damage more defense more sustain and so on very fitting when playing as a puppet i wish each upgrade would change the way your body looks or the more upgrades you put on the more the aesthetic of pinocchio changes but you have costumes for that there is one last thing i find weird about the game from the start it tells you to lie the whole premise of the game is about lying because a puppet would always tell the truth just the way they were designed to but you are different lore wise it makes sense it builds up the story and the character of pinocchio but from a gameplay point of view it just forces you into making choices you would ve otherwise not made the game is great but lacking in depth be it some gameplay aspects or the deprived level design with that said the game was clearly made with passion and it shows when playing it and seeing the amount of detail and work put in which is rare these days i would rate the game a low 8 but the fact they keep improving and changing things based on community feedback shows their love for the game which merits more credit if you enjoyed any of the from software games or dark fantasy genre in general definitely buy it if you are not sure you will enjoy it buy it at a discounted price overall 9 10
