2022 this game saved my life im a 36 year old man that works a dead end job every day when i come home from work i turn on my computer console and just stare at the screen for hours my whole life ive been a lone wolf i cut ties with all my friends because i have that sigma male mindset but recently ive been wanting to have freinds again but all of my old friends dont want anything to do with me thats the reason why i bought this game i actually consider all the npc s like blaid and patches as friends ive built up a relationship with them that is stronger than my very own family everyday at work i get really excited thinking about this game and spending time with them these npcs give me a reason to wake up everyday now and its made me realize that i dont need to be a lone wolf anymore
