2016 been playing on and off since launch i ve seen this game grow from it s humble beginnings to it s current form and i m very amazed at it s journey so far little by little the devs have made the game better such as upgrading the graphics updating the sounds getting rid of a lot of bad bugs some of which have plagued it since launch and lastly they added crossplay which is a nice feature to have imo overall i think this game is amazing and i hope it continues to do well for another 4 years and beyond
