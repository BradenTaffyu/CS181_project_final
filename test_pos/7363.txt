i love this game it s an improvement all around to the first one combat is very fun and story so far is very good the mtx though it shouldn t exist to begin with misinformation is absolutely absurd people are overreacting and blowing it wayyyyy out of proportion if you don t take anything else away from this review please at least read this part you do not need to purchase anything to customize your character fast travel or get rc it is all very easily attainable as you please don t let the misinformation dissuade you i love that it doesn t hold your hand i like thinking and figuring out where to go on my own i love that the time passing actually matters in some quests the pawn system is really cool combat takes a little getting used to but once you get it down it s very very fun performance wise i am running a rtx 3060 with a ryzen 7 5700x im playing on high settings but if i play with the settings i m sure i could get more frames i get 35 45ish in cities and around 50 frames outside of cities i m on a 240hz monitor so the performance could definitely be better but honestly i don t notice it as much as i thought i would i don t get any stutters or anything stupid probably after a few updates this won t be so bad if that kills it for you i d wait and see what future updates bring i m not a fan of the one save slot i mean it s keeping me honest and i m not reloading saves for better outcomes but i m worried i m going to screw up my save i m not saying anything i feel that anyone else hasn t said but i do recommend this game if you re missing out on it because of people lying to you just watch actual gameplay or something it really is an amazing game that doesn t deserve the crap it s getting hope this helps
