2023 this post summed up in a sentence to save you my rant great game but enter at own risk will be verbally abused and have anxiety attacks if you didn t have anger problems you probably will now this game was everything i wanted in a ship pirate style sailing game too bad the community and player base receives a pirate game and immediately dictates its a slaughter fest even after shooting up a white flair to show us they mean no harm can t enjoy the game with casual merchants runs without 2 sloops or paired galleons jumping on us the moment we spawn the foul language and racist rants from 10 20 year olds on the daily if you think you can enjoying a game where you sail the seas and find buried treasure then prepare for server hopping to avoid aggro trash or 3 straight hours of avoiding ships that refuse to leave you be perfect landing mark for trolls and people with aggression problems to vent and let out their anger this game can be fun challenging exciting team building and beautiful and yet its one of the most anxiety triggering aggressive troll magnet games out there even siege and league have a better player base we ve managed to find very rare decent players wanting to pvp minus the toxic rants and accepting being sunk the one time and calling a truce i can count on my hand how many people have teamed up with us or allied and help raise the feeling of the game until the racist slurs and being called the b word repeatedly over playing the game makes me want to avoid this game at all cost
