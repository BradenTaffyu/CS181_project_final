2017 where to begin after 2 years playing csgo i decided to buy r6 seeing that everyone was saying it was kind of alike so i could only like it but in fact r6 is way better than csgo i was getting very tired of all the russians toxic players etc i was getting insulted in almost every game just because i m a girl the community on r6 isn t perfect but most of the time there s the minimum respect between humans being that we re asking for the gameplay is a little like csgo desamorcing a bomb saving a hostage but there s also others gamemodes like for example securing an area my favorite or terrorist hunt you gotta basically kill all the ia ennemies presents in the map it s also way more realistic and harder to aim etc and you gotta be very tactical the operators also are very balanced everyone has its own special gadget and is usefull for the team for me the only cons are clearly ubisoft there s a lot of problems with the servers these times after a game sometimes i don t have the renom i should gain some other times the game don t launch like the server is crashing or something and the players in the room are just stuck together in a loading page and i also think the operators and cosmetics are too expensive and i don t even talk about the 2nd year operators who are almost the double of the price of the 1st one and if you don t pay it will take a hell of a time to get them all but it s still okay cause it doesn t make the game pay to win there s no operator more op than another and i think for every operator there s one who can counter it but i don t think we should really pay attention to these kind of things cause which game never had bugs none especially in ubisoft haha d and never remember that the r6 team is one of the smallest team in ubisoft with the smallest servers so they do what they can if you hesitate to take this game just do it you will enjoy it so much especially if you like cs totally worth the price and i bought the 15 one who can be annoying at beggining cause you won t have many operators so if you have the money i suggest taking the normal one and not the starter edition
