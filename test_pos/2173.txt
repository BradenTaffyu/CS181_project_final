2023 i love it its so much fun playing this with friends but also against other players it s hilarious what can actually happen in games the game has currently 20 maps some you fight with each other and there are also a lot of mini games so i would say there s something for everyone and even if you die and are out you can still sabotage the game by throwing items so in the end you ll never know who will actually win sure there still are a few problems but which game has not any problems they re even taking suggestions to help with better gaming quality of life so i would say they are working really hard to make this a really good game a lot of people can enjoy but if you re quick to enrage to sabotaging or some other small stuff i would say this game is not for you don t be toxic to others hope that will solve some misunderstandings that are going on i can highly recommend this game 3
