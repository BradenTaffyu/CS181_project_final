2017 edit there s some things about this title that did not age wellperformance can be hit or miss now recommend getting the patch by serious remote code execution vulnerability that is only solved by 3rd party patch you re only playing this for zombies at this point nobody should be surprised that mp is dead almost a decade after release mp was really fun while it lasted though i remember the campaign fondly but couldn t tell you anything about it it s absurd that it s still 60 usd ten years out from release but that s how all the call of duty games go pick it up on a good sale plenty of great custom zombies maps to play if you don t feel like shelling out for the chronicles dlc original review below things this game did right splitscreen stable silky smooth 60fps not a port great technical setting options i e primary display option mod support longetivity after lifecycle remastered classic zombies specialists add tactical depth to classes alternate zombies campaignthings this game did wrong i mean getting weapons out of crates purely by chance is a bit of a farce controllers have a teensy bit of aimbotoverall worth your time and money
