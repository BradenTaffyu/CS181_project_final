very good ambiance music world building amazing water graphics co op potential and fun ship management interactions some what decent combat and events updates all ruined by a ton of bugs poor server connection errors that they know about and doesn t fix i mean game breaking kind of errors the list goes on but most importantly the players being a live service multiplayer sandbox type of game is expected to have issues with the different play styles of your player base but the game not wanting to give the pve casual players a good time without the intervention of pvp fanatics because the core gameplay revolves on stealing loot i like to call it progression rewards for you own time rather than loot betraying living the pirate s life is what can and will kill the fun to many people including me the game has an interesting idea and it can be very fun it just depends on how much free time of your life you can pour into it your luck with which kind of people you encounter and if you mind progressing achieving something or not
