2020 sea of thieves is one of the best multiplayer coop experience you can currently get it highly depends of your crew you and up to your 3 friends can join to have your own adventure the beauty of this game is that it does not have any progress in developing your character at first it may seems pretty repetitive and boring there is no way to make your ship stronger or character do more damage this makes every encounter on the seas challenging the only progress that you can make is by knowing the core mechanics better and use them to your advantage by smart managing your ship and using all variety of different cannonballs it is deffinietly possible to sink a 4 person galleon while flying 2 person sloop the only things that you can buy for money are clothes and different skins to your weapons and equipment but you won t gets any benefits by using endgame and rare varieties of this skins you can look whatever you like fitting in many different sets of clothes not losing any stats game had a pretty rough start in 2018 by a lack of content but now rare took a good care of their masterpiece by adding regularly new content and even new core mechanics such as fire rare is one of the most transparent and connected to community companies i ve ever seen they love their game and care about community the updates are well thought and makes changes that make me go back every time the new update is released however this is not game for everyone its mainly for people that have lots of free time to spare quick in and out voyages can become a long hours of traveling thru seas collenting more and more loot just to the point that other crew will decide to attack you and steal all the loot yes this game is pvp only that doesn t necessarily means that everyday you would find someone so desperate to kill you that he will chase you thru all map and eventually get you in confrontation but loosing your hard earned progress just few minutes away from outpost in with u would cash in your loot is a part of game i literally have a thiev word in the title so by setting sail be sure that you will eventually lose many thousands cash by other players it is in my opinion a great test whether you really like this game if you would sail for like a 4 5 hours on duo sloop with your friend just to be downed by a galleon of reapers bones and after a break to chill after this loss you would still want to play and maybe make up what your lost it is definitely a game that i would recommend with all my heart after 1 5 year couple hundred hours and millions in cash stolen from me i am still waiting with a smile on my face to buy this game second time just to have an hour counter i love the aesthetics unique climate developers and every part except double gunning of this masterpiece i you are not sure just buy a 1 dollar trial on xbox game pass with your buddies and give it a shot like i did in march 2019 trust me you won t regret
