2020 early access review in noita there are a handful of things that are true wands cast spells monsters attack you the world is malleable you are the noita this game hates you it actively mocks your attempts to learn each time you descend into the mountain noita is not hard because enemies are hard to hit it s not hard because it s fast paced noita is hard because it is designed exploit at least one loophole in your fragile human skull if you play meticulously inching along you will be killed if you rush in landing shots on monsters left and right you will still be killed the game asks for a level of wisdom about its own world that you will not have for very long time this game is difficult to learn and almost impossible to master as you collect perks spells wands and items you ll get brief glimpses of what you can become you might even reach a point where you think you re as powerful as you can be but then you ll be back at the entrance for the cave wondering how you ever died as you play and explore the world you may find places and wonder why they are there and where they lead you will go places until you wonder why you are still walking you will be alone in an empty world that does not care about you press on learn all that you can find ways to stay alive to win noita there are certain things you must learn learn to edit wands learn to kill all learn to shape the world learn to be a noita
