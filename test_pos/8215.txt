noita is a masterpiece at first the game seems very difficult but the interesting mechanics lured me in to keep playing i was originally looking for games like powder toy and powder game that used falling sand mechanics in an interesting way as a result i found this game day one and i ve loved it since even when the game didn t having over a hundred spells enemies and powers i loved the simple game loop of discovering what could be done with the different spells as a programmer and powder toy enthusiast this was the perfect game for me today the game has many hidden secrets that have even gotten me into cryptography and the strong community of players has really pushed this game far
