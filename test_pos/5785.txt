2020 r6 is a great game i can t recommend it enough if you just want to have fun the first person shooter puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and co operation between players such as your own friends or the funny random people you meet each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage defusing a bomb and taking control of an objective within a room although it may seem like there aren t many ways to play out each game i can say that every round has felt different to me r6 gives players a large selection of operators to play as on both defending and attacking each operator has their own guns skills and abilities to help them win the game with each season or operation comes new operators maps reworks and more r6 comes with a few different gamemodes including casual unranked ranked and sometimes arcade games and events that all come with different maps to compete on this game is one of the few that give you such heavy adrenaline rushes in game that make you feel so satisfied when you see that you ve won the match although this game has it s ups it has its fair share of bugs and glitches and hackers each season that sometimes makes you feel extremely low when playing it s developers and community are for the most part a big help to make the game better even looking at gameplay from when the game first came out you can see that the developers have seriously improved the whole game since getting the game i ve worked my way up to level 100 and looking back i can easily remember how large of a learning curve there was if you re willing to get past that you will have fun and it ll be worth the time and effort put in
