2018 dead by daylight one of the games i really have a kind of love hate relationship to i like the concept and the game itself 4 survivors trying to activate repair 5 generators to activate the exit gates and 1 killer trying to prevent them from a successfull repair escape and kill by chasing catching and hooking them to ultimately sacrifice the survivor to the entity sounds fun and it definetly is if you play with friends but be aware when you play with random players this game can get really frustrating due to a quite often toxic selfish communityin my opinion as a survivor you re not supposed to have a 100 chance getting out of the game alive you re supposed to try and reach the exit by teamwork using any tool you ve got with you or find on the map in case a killer is camping well who cares team up to free the survivor on the hook instead of teamwork loads of times you ll end up in a match having selfish team mates not caring if you got hooked or downed by the killer minding their own business or after a very tense match feeling good about the game you return to the lobby to find either survivors killers or both having a go at each other for whatever random reason killers ranting in the lobby when the last survivor tries finding using the hatch instead of just surrender and let them kill you however if you are lucky enough getting a nice group in a public match you ll have loads of fun tension within a game environment offering a great athmosphere as well as a levelling system so you can obtain items and special perks for your survivors killers
