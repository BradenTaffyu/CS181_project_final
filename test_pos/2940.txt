2019 has a great single player campaign and now i m soaking up hours in online so much to do and so much fun i cannot uninstall just yet edit so much has changed since my 2019 review r has killed any fun gta online had to offer i ll still recommend this game for the campaign but a big thumbs down for online play not looking forward to gta 6
