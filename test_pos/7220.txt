the game is actually pretty fun and what i expect from dragon dogma series that being said the performance issues may hinder your enjoyment and having bunch of microtransactions in addition of us 70 pricetag does leave bitter impression despite most of the items are obtainable in game there s however some tips to improve your fps option 1 for nvdia user nvidia control panel manage 3d settings global settings shader cache size change to unlimited or if you cant find it on global setting just go to program setting and add dragon dogma 2 option 2 for nvdia rtx40 series use dlss3 enabler 3 for psychopaths massacre bunch of random npcs so the amount of npcs and the fps balanced as all things should beoption 4 save yourself and dont buy the game at least until devs fix this problem because you dont deserve being treated like this after paying 70
