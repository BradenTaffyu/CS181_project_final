2023 i am a 28 year old nun probably one of the youngest single mothers playing this game i am the sole guardian to my gamer son who is now 12 my son recently downloaded dead by daylight and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out repairing generators while i was busy comforting those who were affected by the recent dota 2 update so i decided to get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you were supposed to do much like claudette mains when they have to use actual skill i asked him for help and he happily showed me how to play the game i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since we went to bronycon with his father my ex husband 8 years ago this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again since we actually spend time together laughing and re enacting the legend of the facecamper bubba this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
