2020 at first i thought this game was not going to be my type but i was wrong after 30 or so hours it has become my go to game for every day to have fun and relax you can never know what will derail the next adventure a wild kraken spawn a galleon controlled by other people sailing your way unlike other games there is not a strong narrative or by this time i didn t discovered it most of the good memories comes from the experiences the random unpredictable funny yet chaotic nature of the game provides you just to outline a few positives and negatives the negatives awkward to invite friends have to use the xbox comapnaion app one time only if you log out all the stuff you were carrying cannon balls chest de spawns vanishes there are some micro transaction in the game character creation is more like choose one of the less ugly random character generated or reroll the dice the positives the water looks beautifulnice amount of player character equipment and ship customisationcosmetic only affect looks but not stats if you play with a party each member can individually change the cosmetic on the various ship parts that is visible for everyone there are not many other players on the server but most encounters are memorable no place is safe from other players each ship class has a different set of advantages and dissadvantagestipps and advice if you decide to buy the game i would advise to get a friend with you and beware of other ships and crews everyone can sell your loot and so can you if you can sink their ship
