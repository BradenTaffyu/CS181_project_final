2023 warhammer 3 is like a new pair of expensive shoes with a tiny piece of glass jumbling around in it that you will never get out you will turn it upside down and shake it you will change socks you ll walk differently you ll think you ve taken care of it and you ll feel amazing in your new shoes on a beautiful day for a while and then you re stung again foremost is that it s addicting because of its excellent core gameplay and there always being something new to try or get better at wh3 is huge various and it s good it s awesome even speaking as someone who played rome shogun and medieval 2 for a decade if i want to play medieval again i ll just start a bretonnia campaign and that s just one of the many factions unless i want better music pre battle speeches and those cool event movies as you find out things that excite you engross you and build your book of strategies you will find out other things such as the loooooooaaddd times actively discouraging manual battling the performance is poor for the visual quality especially on minimum it still chugs after you make it look like dough and you need mods to demake it enough to not cook your gpu the amount of factions lords you can play with the base game is low and you re expected to have warhammer 1 and 2 to access their races and a lot of dlc after you ve already paid full price dlc content isn t intrinsically bad but it s likely that you ll be a bit disappointed if you just purchase wh3 new factions are starkly powercrept old ones are being updated but at a glacial pace there exists a downright silly anti player bias where enemies will sometimes ignore all reason and self preservation to march full stacks at you from preposterous distances sometimes they declare war the instant you discover them and perhaps they were building armies and waiting in the fog doing nothing but waiting only to launch them at you once you meet them even though they were adjacently surrounded by other hostile targets edit this may have been retuned as of 4 0 will update later the empire is supposed to suck and have an agonizing start position and it being recommended as a beginner faction is a cruel joke chaos is the main character and general favourite and you will feel it enemies take less attrition in higher difficulties to the point of rendering it irrelevant this hurts vampire skaven tomb king and nurgle players skaven plagues do unavoidable unmitigatable attrition to an army putting it out of commission for 5 turns plus 2 5 more to heal back up moreover they do not care if you are allied with them allying with skaven does not stop them from plagueing you because they plague your common enemy and they spread for a long time having war declared while being next to your new enemy s lord or city will trap you inside of their zone of control and not let you leave unless you initiate an attack and then retreat some critical strategies that make your faction not miserable or even quite powerful will take many hours and new attempts to discover unless you watch a video first in other words racial tutorials are barebones and don t describe practical play expectations as cathay chaos will ignore the great bastion outside of a rare scripted event and backdoor you with a hilarious 20 turn journey through the mountains the ability to build walls around minor settlements was removed even at the maximum growth stage and maximum wall building tier huh unit performance is not insignificantly dictated by an undocumented animation metagame which governs splash damage and entity finishers quests and grudges that require raiding a region or attacking a city lord with a hero don t complete if you do more than that claiming the region claiming the city or slaying the lord in battle nope you have to specifically raid that region and you fail the quest if you conquer it instead every time you leave a section of your border undefended you are punished severely and have to learn repeatedly to always expect the most annoying inconvenient bs to occur even if taking it slow means crippling your campaign this does make some starts where you re totally exposed on multiple fronts reliant on big gambles pathfinding around walls in siege battles may cause hemorrhoids playing chase the goose with an enemy lord in march stance that just perfectly slipped by you will cause hemorrhoids ai factions have a hidden faction potential which gives them artificial extra production regardless of difficulty and autoresolve power when fighting each other legendary lord factions have much more fp than minor factions and will erase them by virtue of fp difference rather than actual military difference this also means allying with minor factions is pointless additionally when the player hasn t discovered these factions yet they have another invisible mechanic shroud their fp based autoresolve advantage is doubled this means that you drastically change the nature of the world simply by having vision of it and if you re not careful you can significantly nerf factions you like while distant enemies keep their undiscovered bonus fp is both randomized and weighted based on your starting faction so now you change the nature of the world just by what faction you start with this is silly it s understandable to give ai production and military bonuses based on difficulty but to include these arbitrary invisible modifications just confuses the player and tempts them to metagame rather than play normally beyond your comprehension if your ambush trigger fails and the enemy declines to engage he can just walk right through your army and raze your settlement instead of being forced to retreat backward like the player is while passing your turn and sieging an enemy city if they sally out to fight you and you don t slay enough troops such that the enemy garrison survives and you don t claim the city your siege is canceled and a all of your equipment building progress is lost b attrition will not tick that turn and c another faction can initiate their own siege on the city stealing the tag from you new factions are added without care to how they affect the situation of old factions the immediate neighbours of chaos dwarfs perhaps the most juiced up faction to exist received no rebalancing when they were added despite it wholly changing the nature and demands of their faction starts the dammaz kron shuts other than that it s fun sometimes a lot of fun see the shoe metaphor if you re looking for more complex diplomacy and economy other tws like three kingdoms would be more to your taste however in my opinion tw diplomacy was never good no matter how deep it was and having to meticulously manage your trade network would be silly in the face of kragbock teh eternel killer coming out of the fog whose sole responsibility is to well it s in the name diplomacy is there and it s deep enough though missing a joint war declaration option instead of one of you having to be at war first it could be tuned better economy is the same different factions have fairly different styles of diplomacy and economy so i suppose that s how the game makes up for it breadth over depth but not too shallow that same principle applies to much of the title i reiterate buyer beware if you expect to make a single purchase or even a few and be done with it
