2015 very fun game with a great an amazing gameplay pretty decent missions and length graphics stepped up and the story was great and enjoyable but in my opinion it could have been improved the charactes are well made and the story of each of them is well written small things are important and gta 5 has a lot of them and you are not getting bored that fast a lot of mini games and missions to play alone or also with friends one of the better things are the heists you need to cooperate with your mates to succeed gta 5 has also a beautiful expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn t that small at all a lot of things to do and areas to explore one of the things that annoys you in gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that pros fun enjoyable and well written story a lot of missions to play either with friends or alone beautiful graphics gorgeous open world heists good customization for cars characters are awesome impressive degree of freedom first person camera cons not that great mm large number of hackers character customization could be better not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode in few words gta 5 it s an amazing and fun game without doubt it s like a next gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far you can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day it begs to be played all over again especially when you have company it s a must for everyone to try out those who didn t play that masterpiece yet they definitely should i recommend this game to anyone without remorse cheers
