2019 i ve been playing dead by daylight and streaming it since the halloween chapter came out and i love the game so much all the work and effort and love put into the game really shows yes problems show from time to time but that will happen no matter what game you play really wish there was a way to combat toxic survivors and killers but until that time me and my community will do our best to foster good vibes and good times
