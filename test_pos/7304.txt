dd2 is a genuinely great 7 10 rpg that was hampered by performance issues at launch ok for starters the story is waaay better than dd da and frankly the people saying otherwise have got bad nostalgia goggles the story in dd da is literally a dragon makes a cult to bait you into a fight there is no intrigue or real side characters in the story in dd2 most of the complaints about the side characters are from people who did the initial quest and then did not bother to find do the remainder of their quest line now is dd2 simple yes is that bad no it makes me so happy to have a great 60 hour rpg that doesn t really hold your hand and lets you find your own adventure while also providing a solid 7 10 main story if you are looking for another baldurs gate 3 then i d probably skip this but if you want a solid as hell 7 10 rpg then hell ya i d get it if you are still on the fence then i would probably wait till dlc comes out and they do a bundle sale for it
