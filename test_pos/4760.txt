2022 after seeing streamers complain and cry about the next iteration of a franchise they ruined with their sweaty metas and movement exploits i decided to buy it and i can safely say that it s the best cod in years it s fun the weapons and customization is great the game looks amazing and the sound design is incredible the gun play feels good and every hit feels impactful and packs an extra oomph that the last two titles didn t manage to do here s some of the main issues these man babies a k a steamers keep talking about fast time to kill ttk people have become so accustomed to the warzone ttk that they forget how fast paced the standard multiplayer is don t believe me go look up some old mw2 or bo2 death match footage and compare the ttk to the new mw2 spoiler it s the same bad no movement yes you can no longer slide around like a kid that discovered what knee sliders are the movement is slower and heavier because the game focuses on gunplay and positioning what most of these aim assist controller streamers that need to run vpn s and cronus zen scripts aren t good at basically conclusion yes the movement is slower and more grounded but still cracked up on cocaine compared to the og titles like mw2 mw3 bo2 that we fell in love with again don t believe me look up some footage and compare campers sentinel meme yes people camp yes they sit and wait for you to round the corner is it anything new no it s been a part of cod since forever people are just so used to zooming around the map carelessly and not getting punished for it nonetheless there are multiple gadgets equipment streaks and field upgrades that let you expose these so called campers they literally added a grenade that goes through walls skill based matchmaking when you enter a game you are up against people of your level sound reasonable right well at least for the majority of players yes but the man baby streamers are angry cause they now need to extend their tunnelbear vpn subscriptions not sponsored to play against people that are worse than them and stay relevant on twitch tv s b m is only hurting the top 10 of players that play the game like it s their f cking job and that need the satisfaction of on a lobby and get their moab s off regardless to say sbm has been a thing in cod forever and isn t new if you don t believe me how do you think one of the biggest game franchises retains their casual players biggest player demographic answer a queue the casual players up against sweats to get their pushed in answer b queue the casual players up against other casuals so they can feel like they re good spoiler the answer is bconclusion don t let these non issues deter you from enjoying the best cod in years and play the game yourself see if you vibe with it you can always refund the game if you don t like it thank you gaben now for the actual issues 70 price tag for a digital release is just mind boggling game is poorly optimized and crashes constantly if you mess with your load out while queuing up even on high end pc s the maps selection is way too small for the price tag ground war is fun and could ve ended the battlefield franchise especially after 2042 but infinity ward did not capitalize on it same modes with a couple new modes added in to spice things up albeit not enough ui was improved since beta but still feels too messy
