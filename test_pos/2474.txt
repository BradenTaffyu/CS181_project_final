2020 this game is great and makes a lot of fun nice maps nice abilities nice fights and the game is quite fast and intense if you re fighting versus multiple squads or getting gangb excuse me sandwiched between them and due to it s such a fast game i don t really care about winning getting champion i just want to make as much kills as possible and if you die well let s go for another jump so yeah i m recommending it to everyone who loves battle royale cod ow and similar games cya ingame
