hello i don t tend to review many games and i certainly don t do them early but i feel like this one needs a review due to the recent review bombs i have seen pros the pawn system is interesting fun and unique build variety being able to change class at will and experiment is great fun exploration you are really encouraged to explore to uncover secrets which has you playing the game at a more methodical pace combat this is fun and refreshing action based combat consequences side quests i enjoy the fact that there are consequences to actions and the side quests are decent it doesn t hold your hand which encourages rpg elements such as figuring out some quests not all as many do still have markers and making you live with the consequences of your actions which i feel like will add replayability it does have ng cons performance in the capital does drop a bit it is still very much playable for me and doesn t bother me but it is there the most annoying bit is npcs popping in the game is cpu heavy so don t expect graphics to fix it you will need a higher end pc to play it currently movement is a bit slow it would have been nice to maybe have a mount or have it where stamina doesn t drain out of combat encounters can get repetitive the game throws enemies at you a lot and since you have to walk everywhere and are slow you end up fighting the same enemies a lot micro transactions aren t great and i will never condone them but at least you can get all of the paid for items in this game early on i don t feel a need to buy anything and they haven t unnecessarily slowed down your experience to make you want to buy them like ubisoft does verdict is this game for you it is hard to say dragon s dogma was always a polarising game it is not like many other rpgs and you shouldn t go into it expecting it to be if you want to play it safe you can get the first one in a heavy sale and very cheap to try out the style of game before buying this one this game doesn t really feel too much like a sequel in all honesty and the developer s have even sort of confirmed that it wasn t meant to be this is more like dragon s dogma 1 5 it is what they envisioned the first one to be but didn t have the technology at the time to make so the first one will give you a very good idea if you are on the fence i would highly recommend just waiting for a sale before buying and do plenty of research maybe watch some let s plays reviews critiques but try not to spoil it too much in case you go for it i m not entirely sure myself if it is worth the current price tag but i do think it is a good and fun game and is worth playing so long as you understand what you are getting you can always wait for a price drop and some patches to fix some of the current issues edit i have now played the game for a lot longer than i had with my first review i am still enjoying it massively and think it is worth the price if this is your style of game i see personally see myself playing this for a very long time
