2023 if you like a good shooter this game is for you apex is a tough game sometimes matches dont go your way and you can have a really rough time once you learn the game though and learn how not to die off drop its a drug when i get a killing spree and wipe multiple teams the dopamine flowing through me is exceptional there is no better feeling then winning a apex game with over 2000 damage and loads of kills i feel like god has come down to honor me and my amazing skills after wiping half the map truly a wonderful blood pumping dopamine hitting feeling
