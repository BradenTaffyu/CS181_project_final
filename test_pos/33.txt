as i face the reality of my terminal illness diagnosis this game has become a rare light in my life growing up i found comfort in the unforgiving challenge and beauty of soulslike games and now in what may be my final months this game has given me a chance to reconnect with that comfort one last time the developers have created a visually stunning and mechanically precise action rpg that offers both the challenge and the sense of achievement that we crave the intricate combat alongside the visually striking environments makes every moment memorable it s given me something to look forward to allowing me to lose myself in its rich world when i need it most if you re a fan of soulslike games and appreciate the art of a well crafted challenge i can t recommend black myth wukong enough to me it s not just a game it s a gift providing a final sense of purpose and achievement my deepest gratitude goes to the developers for creating this masterclass
