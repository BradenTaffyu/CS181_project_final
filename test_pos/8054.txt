2020 early access review okay time to finally review this i ve waited quite awhile and for good reason my opinion of the game sort of jumped back and forth alot for quite awhile sometimes i loved it other times i hated it no way i could write a review when i wasnt even quite sure how i felt about it noita is amazing in alot of ways but it does some really bizarre things that could really push some players away or that just make it really hard to get to that point where it clicks for you i have occaisionally referred to noita as the next spelunky when talking about it with people yeah in alot of ways the gameplay isnt really similar other than the fact that it s a platformer and you go downwards through a dungeon but what i really mean is the wild emergent gameplay spelunky is famous for being hilarious due to the bonkers things that might happen in the third zone for instance a yeti across the level might throw a rock which hits a ufo dude which plummets to the ground and then explodes sending a landmine flying which then hits you in the head stunning you and then it lands next to you on the ground and explodes it does stuff like this often there are so many hilarious death compilation videos of it on youtube the emergent elements of the game add to it in so many ways and they ensure that it s constantly funny instead of frustrating noita is alot like that for the most part the falling everything engine creates a world where every little particle can interact with every other conceivable thing and physics takes over from there heavy wooden beams liquids of all sorts fire explosive barrels giant tentacle monsters bloody stupid worm things all these things and so many more interact in ways that will constantly surprise you you ll die alot but boy will it be funny mostly and everything about the gameplay works with this you can use all these elements against your foes or against yourself if you re not careful on top of that you can build wands combining a bazillion different spell components in all sorts of ways to create tons of wild effects you have alot of freedom in how you go about doing this however like anything else in the game you gotta be careful with it lest you simply blow your own face off with some sort of boomerang deathray wands have lots of different stats as well and there are all sorts of perks for you to use to build your character in addition noita is stuffed full of secrets i cant remember the last time i saw so many in one game you start with the dungeon of course like in spelunky but it doesnt take too long before you ll find a way to go over that mountain or right through it and find yourself in the gigantic overworld that giant dungeon it s pretty darned small compared to what s out there there is so much to do noita is a big game and there are so many ways to approach it so with all that positive stuff why did i have such a love hate view of it well for every amazing thing noita does it then does something that can kinda ruin the fun for some players for example that wand editing pretty great and all but you can only do it inside of the temples between each dungeon floor and you cant really test those wands in there because if you damage the temple the gods get angry and you re in big trouble so you have to design your wand get your perk leave the temple and that s pretty much a one way deal and then if your wand experiment turns out to be bad well tough you cant do anything about it until the next temple this means that despite all that design potential the game heavily discourages players from experimenting because the slightest misstep in wand design could either leave you stuck with something pathetic that cant kill anything we ll get to that or something hyper dangerous that kills you when you try to use it and once you re dead well it s a looooooooong trip back to where you were speaking of not being able to kill anything ever played enter the gungeon you know how in the game enemy hp bloating just keeps making things take longer and longer to kill but without actually increasing the difficulty of said enemies noita grabs that concept and takes it up to 11 enemies have waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much hp outside of the first couple of areas in terms of getting anywhere in the game one thing and only one thing matters sheer dps the game has all sorts of cool utility spells and such but they re irrelevant in the face of that monstrously bloated hp of pretty much every foe i ve had so many runs that i havent finished not because i got asploded but because i got bored and simply quit because i just couldnt find the things needed to do enough damage so that each fight didnt take 20 eternities of course you can also bypass alot of things by digging through the levels but that s almost entirely dependant on finding the extremely specific spell that can do that black hole which is a limited use spell by the way note that this spell is required to do most of the game s big secrets digging is really important yeah there s bombs but they cant damage dense materials in addition the game seems to place extreme importance on certain perks it often seems absolutely necessary for you to have at least 2 or 3 of the important ones while some other ones are mostly useless there s a bit too much rng here and too much potential for just a couple of them to totally break the game s challenge and then there s the secrets hoboy look i get what they re going for here but you ll find that many of them require a guide how anyone figured some of them out in the first place is beyond me want a good example look up videos on the game s hidden alchemy mechanic on youtube see how it works and you ll see what i mean many secrets are super cryptic and if there s any real clues anywhere as to those i ve never seen them while others are quite easy to find simply requiring you to go in their general direction and overall there s just too much dependance on rng you need the right spells the right perks the right everything and if the game doesnt give them to you well that s a road to frustration i say this as someone who has beaten the game numerous times and gotten multiple endings and some of the tougher secrets fortunately it s fully moddable with workshop support you can completely customize your experience so that does help alot dont like the whole angering the gods thing get a mod that turns it off want even more crazy content yep modders have you covered noita is a game that can be spectacular hilarious frustrating and bloody stupid all at the same time a game of incredible potential yet one that might have you throwing your monitor out the window in sheer frustration i strongly suggest watching some playthroughs on youtube before buying so you get more of an idea of what it s really like and whether or not you would like it this is one of those games where just looking at reviews doesnt quite cut it but if it does click with you you re going to keep coming back to it for a long time to come
