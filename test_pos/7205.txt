pros the world looks amazing and stunning it s huge more options for fast travel no spoilers explore it multiple vocations classes than can be changed anytime in cities villages combat is fluid not clunky lots of items there are things that can only be found in different places because it s like an exclusive option to buy stuffs for real money for players that don t want to grind everything can be achievable for free so you don t need to pay for it if you like grinding pawn system is fun you can meet other players pawns and when you dismiss them you can even give feedback and a gift to the other player during a sale it is definitely worth buying you can have a lot of fun with dragon s dogma 2 cons optimization problems mostly in the cities the variety of enemies can get pretty boring if you stay in the same area for long periods of time the dialogues of the pawns can be repeated several times within a short time which can frustrate some players pawns roam the map and different pawns may repeatedly try to stop you to introduce themselves to you to try to recruit them some people are bothered by this but if you avoid them and not go close to them this can be avoided it has a hate train because of these the microtransactions which is optional bad launch and this is not a sequel of the first game but rather a reboot there are things that were in dragon s dogma dark arisen that are missing from dragon s dogma 2 beside the problems dragon s dogma 2 has i really enjoy it s gameplay hopefully we ll get a dlc that fixes the existing issues and will arrive with a lot of new content thank you for reading
