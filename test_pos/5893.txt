2020 while i generally love this game i have a few warnings to those who are interested in buying it the community can be toxic as hell there s three basic types of toxicity new players who are uninformed not your fault who do things the community considers bad manners experienced perfectionists people who enjoy other s suffering higher learning curve than some expect learning survivor and killer perks is important regardless of what you main common tactics to avoid getting downed or looped prioritization situational awareness where is everyone what are they doing what should you be doing community slang matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired inexperienced paired with experienced but in a one gets dunked on arrangement not teaching sometimes often seems to be under the influence when making lobbies wait times however there s some pretty nifty things dlc characters can be unlocked through gameplay it takes 9000 iridescent shards which are gained through leveling one s account up the shrine of secrets changes every week and potentially has perks from dlc characters available folks who can t afford dlc can still get the characters perks friends not required but make experience better no in game voice chat for survivors some use discord instead in game emotes used to communicate as well as crouching relatively easy to find new friends if you re nice most people who play survivor want full swf crews replayable wide variety of maps characters perks opportunity for a wide variety of play styles private or public matches for whatever your purpose including goofing off lots of shenanigans get waterboarded by puke throw a flashlight rave thiccness knows no morals or gender overall i d recommend probably about a 8 5 10 have not pooped my pants due to this game but have come close a time or two thanks ghost face update may 28 2021 new content is still being released more mechanics are being added to the game which changes how survivors play ex zombies being added in the r e chapter in player test build at the time of this update some cosmetics can be purchased with shards unlocked through game play or redeemed via codes released by bhvr periodic events currently there s an event to find gnome chompski once the exit gates are powered map and graphical updates the game generally looks a lot better now multiple variants of maps maps tend to be smaller now which can be both good and bad gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks the rift a battle pass has been added to the game auric cells paid currency are part of the reward system if you complete the rift you actually get your money back players are rewarded with cosmetics lore the archives and various forms of in game currency challenges from the rift add an extra layer of fun or psychological distress and anguish to matches matchmaking again queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon evening i m a filthy survivor main heathen so i can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon evening still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair but it s better than it used to be there s a lot more player consistency in terms of skill but also toxicity in higher ranks if you want to meme and enjoy the higher ranks tend to be very serious hit boxes make me cry this is just a game please self it s just a game sobbing intensifies in all seriousness though the hit boxes need some improvement lag frame perfect timing and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face i may be a survivor main but if a huntress nails me across the map i m impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer s behalf if it doesn t register what accessibility options changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences an option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful a fade in solid color then fade out screen aura might be a good option for this it would preserve visual information without giving an unfair advantage to players for the record players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else if your primary concern is giving players an unfair advantage please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field i d say that the changes boost my rating to a 9 10 but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2 10 to bhvr if they ever stumble their way into this review the new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated and it would increase audience reach and profitability keep up the good work update april 21 2022 some mentions boon totems were added aoe survivor buffs experimental wiggle mechanic skill checks instead of button mashing hit boxes are still whack the game is playable if you re in it for memeingful not meaningful gameplay most of my points from previous updates still stand cross play was added can be disabled matchmaking is now skill based leaving ranks obsolete there s still grades based on pips but these have no influence on a person s actual mmr content it doesn t feel like in game content has changed substantially new killers and survivors have been added but i rarely see them or their perks after a couple of weeks pass cosmetics are nice but ultimately they re just something to collect the stranger things chapter is gone i m out of characters so no more updates unless something drastic happens and i delete old points overall 7 10 fun but flawed
