for me warhammer 3 is probably one of the best 3 strategy games out there and the best when it comes to warhammer warhammer 3 is the perfect application of the total war series game principle in terms of administration diplomacy combat with the addition of warhammer lore anyone who likes to get information about their units i e apart from numbers the characters in the game the races etc will find many texts describing their backgrounds in the warhammer fantasy world on the world map which has been designed with great attention to warhammer detail there are also plenty of points of interest to see and read and i think i ve even seen felix and gotrek as an army on the map the base game has included the almost complete warhammer fantasy map and races for some time now however you can only play a few of them after buying the basic game you then have to buy expansions or the two older games to be able to play more races but all the races are in the game and they are then controlled by the ai the technical side also fits the graphic art style the music and the voice acting create a dense warhammer atmosphere and the game also runs stable for me the low rating of the game seems to me to come mainly from players for whom the prices of the dlcs are too high and i have to say it s true they are expensive but i d rather get new dlcs for a few more years than have the game cancelled just to make it cheap anyone who plays warhammer as a table top knows the price issue in terms of content however i also found the last dlc too shallow for the price i paid regardless of such fan discussions it s a great strategy game that can really be fun for a very long time
