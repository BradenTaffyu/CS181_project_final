if you like destiny 2 but hate getting disappointing every 3 6 months then warframe is the f2p game for you there is so much to do and grind for that you wont have any time or energy to complain because the time you took to complain about something 4 primes and 5 quests came out and now you re 2 years behind with no relics and no credits and no endo and no build
