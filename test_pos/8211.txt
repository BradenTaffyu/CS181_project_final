2022 honestly i have absolutely no idea if i like this game or not it s the most frustrating difficult complicated and deep game i ve played in a long long time but i ve definitely played a lot of it i can t seem to put it down every run i learn something new or feel like i m improving even after 100 hours as a game dev myself i hold this and baba is you as the gold standard for innovation in video games i think both of them are must play games for anyone that s even remotely interesting in video games as a media
