2020 first impression review firstly i feel that the 40 price tag is fair there s a lot to do in this game it gets major event updates every month i would recommend you buy it on sale or game pass to try it out it s definitely worth trying in my opinion the developer cares about the game and provides regular free updates if you can play with friends it s even better i have been playing solo and i m having blast it takes an hour or two to get used to micromanaging as a solo player it s absolutely playable as a solo player i ve had no problems playing on my own rare honestly deserves the love they ve gotten for this game while it had a rocky start and it took them a while to bring all their vision to light they promised continued support and development they ve been honest with us on every issue not tried to sweep things that were genuinely game breaking under the rug and ran a few decisions past the players too in conclusion the game is excellent definitely worth buying if you have some money to spare if you re on the fence about buying it sign up for the xbox game pass this lets you get access to the entire library for a monthly fee and has a two week free trial you can hop on board cancel the subscription get your two weeks in and make your decision then
