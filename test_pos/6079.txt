2017 i appreciate the free weekend for day by deadlight since i was very interested in playing the game and now that i put some hours into it i can say for sure that this is a very addictive survival horror game i want to explain why to me this is a love letter to fans of the classic slasher horror movies like halloween friday the 13th the texas chainsaw massacre it really does a fantastic job by creating this foreboding atmosphere where you can actually simulate those terrifying moments that you watched on tv now instead of being the one sitting comfortably on your sofa shouting at the protagonists for making the wrong decisions you can now be the protagonist and try to overcome the situation yourself or if you want to see the annoying teens of the movie bite the dust you can now be the murdering psycho that finishes them off at its core dead by deadlight is a cat and mouse game where four survivors are up against one killer in one of many scary locations the group must work together repair five generators in order to activate and open the exit door all while avoiding the killer of course it sounds simple enough however the key to success is to cooperate with the other survivors you will quickly learn just how important it is to keep everyone alive the fever you are the easier it will be for the killer to track you down what i love about this is that you are not given any in game chat the only means of communication are hand gestures the survivors are at a serious disadvantage because of this and adds serious tension during every round each killer has its own means of attack and abilities to which they can use now something that is important to mention is the camera view while the survivors have a third person view the killer has a first person view this brings balance to the game although it does not make things easier two hits from the killer and you are down they can either leave you to crawl in agony or pick you up and hang you from a meat hook the other survivors can rescue and heal you at the risk of being caught themselves while many might hate the fact you cannot harm the killer i think it s a cool aspect since survivors must use their wits and plan a strategy to survive there is clearly lots of grinding to do in this game just to level up each character that you play not only to unlock items that you can use but also perks which are quintessential i don t mind it though there is such a rich experience to have every single round lots of thrilling chases lots of new stuff to discover and learn there is a lot of fun content here to keep you engaged there are many flaws here as well many glitches many network problems lack of tutorials lack of pc options had to disable vsync from ini files and the matchmaking can be awful at times i also strongly believe that this game is not for everyone i suggest giving it a try while it is still free to play before purchasing overall i ll say dead by daylight is a very nice multiplayer game with decent challenges good co op and with an immersive atmosphere for any horror fan to enjoy
