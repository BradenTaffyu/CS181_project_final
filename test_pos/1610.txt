2022 pc intel i9 10850k 3 60ghz rtx 3080 32gb ram win10 2560x1440 144hz long review tl dr at the end visuals and performancethe game offers great visuals it runs smooth at max settings on my pc so far i got one random crash but some people with older hardware report more using alt tab does crash the game often annoying but no big deal i notice no major framerate drops only a tiny drop if there s four full armies in battle normalizes after some units die the prologue presentation is well done except you are forced to press buttons or watch ingame cutscenes where the camera moves all over the place before you can progress it distracts from an otherwise speckless prologue in terms of ui the demonic khorne red menu layout reminds me of a mobile game menu ultimately it works looks ok and you ll find total war elements where you d expect them to be the model quality is great but what did catch my eye is that some units have odd animations for example kislev streltsi units will shoot an enemy and then crouch or stand still instead of reloading their gun you will hardly notice this though most animations are great the game offers great graphics style and performance for my hardware but it lacks some polish for perfection gameplay factionsi will not go in depth on each faction but we have kislev chaos demons the four main chaos factions ogre kindoms and cathay considering that we are used to in mortal empires this feels like a meagre quantity but mortal empires was also added to tw wh2 at a later time to see chaos collide with we will have to wait for immortal empires for now we can finish the campaign quest line for these factions for kislev it means taking relics of the primary four chaos factions to free ursun while politically stabilising your faction really kislev is an alternative russian themed empire campaign summaryyou can use chaos rifts that appear from events every x turns to move of course other factions can travel to you if you want to be safe you must close them they can also spawn chaos rebels it s always a surprise if something heads your way rifts appear all across the map so you need to be ready to use both defensive and offensive armies you will find yourself at war on multiple fronts while you struggle between building faction mechanic or economic buildings this time you can t make random demands in diplomacy this was prone to cheese in older tw games you make deals based on faction approval without the approval you need to balance the approval gap for example with gold before you can make a deal there are some deals where you can try to threaten the target faction risking approval drops if you cannot make a balanced offer factions generally accept a deal as long as you have the required approval and or a balanced offer also you can trade settlements if you take settlements you don t need or don t want to defend you can give them to your proxy buffer allies perhaps even get one of theirs there are many fires to put out at once at the start of a campaign so having a defensive ally act as a proxy buffer will help other than that it has the usual campaign elements of a tw wh game that don t warrant further review combatcombat mechanics are largely unchanged ranged magic and lord hero units still dictate the course of battle the offensive power of frost and tzeentch magic impressed me but the way in which it s used isn t new winds of magic regeneration is improved though cavalry is still only useful for cycle charging or running down enemies they can still get stuck in multiple units in melee their speed is meaningless if they can t pull their own weight in damage and utility i only use cavalry as bait or to run down routing enemies melee units are good to hold the line but you ll never encounter any enemy for which the answer is not ranged magic or both instead you can still use fast units heroes as bait the ai is not improved the ai fails to deal with cheese like corner camping ammo wasting and luring enemy units sieges changed a bit defenders can build ramps a la atilla and towers however on most maps attackers can still exploit blindspots the ai is never in control of a defensive siege tw wh3 hasn t taken steps up or down from tw wh2 however the formula can get old 1 there are mechanics that give penalties to your faction 2 you build to counter penalties while fighting off enemy attackers 3 your army bonuses become so good that the the ai s only strategy of attacking you cannot work anymore that s the part where you start mopping up and stop caring i still enjoy it but there s room for improvement humanity developed chess tournament winning ai yet we can t develop strategy game ai that can do more than spam armies and send them at the player but lose every battle to cheese game opinionthere is a lack of polish and waiting for immortal empires makes the game currently feel like a teaser for itself mechanically it brings little new things to the table as a warhammer or tw game however i just want to see all fantasy warhammer factions in their full glory that this game does well i expect the same for immortal empires this game is not the second coming of something holy but it s one of the best pc games i played in recent years i didn t recommend tw wh1 for a full price pre order because i did not approve of pre order schemes and an incomplete chaos faction i did not like all the tw wh2 dlc however tw wh3 is definitely worth my 60 because they get it thematically right and it s a functional ejoyable total war game opinion on chinese review bombingfrom what i understand this is about keys being handed out some time before the official release to chinese streamers who are not warhammer tw fans they spoiled the game for the chinese audience while long term chinese fans had no opportunity to play it i can see it wasn t a great move by ca so i can sympathize but this means a lot of negative reviews are not submitted for an opinion on the game itself i don t think review bombing helps the community the opinion on a game or developer publisher can vary by localization and this isn t the first time maybe the positivity rating should be something you can filter by region so users can get more context on public reception that said i do not think someone else receiving a key to play a game before you do makes for much of a negative review or should really affect your experience criticism of a game tl drthe game is not the second coming of anything it does not revolutionize anything but it s a great pc strategy game and a great addition to the tw wh series chaos is thematically done really well and that alone is a reason for me to play this if you have doubts wait until the release of immortal empires if you are chinese and are outraged by the streamer key situation write creative assembly an email but ffs review the game for the game
