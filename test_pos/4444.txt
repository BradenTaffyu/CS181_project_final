2023 read this might help i played this game for years tho not via steam so my hours here don t say much if you re new and you heard this game is very grindy it s definitely the truth but you ll love it anyway there is a great story line to follow well written emotional even more emotional thanks to some amazing music writing there is plenty of other things for you to do aside from the story from fishing on a lake or playing your string instrument to waging a war in the open space or commiting a ge cide daily you can play solo or with a squad or simply invite your bros massive amount of different weapons and a bunch of different characters to suit your playstyle plus warframe community is one of the best communities i ve ever seen i hope this review gets somewhat of an attention to reach new players and in the meantime i m gonna go put a few more hundreds of hours into it time to wake up tenno
