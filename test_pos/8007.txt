2022 i had attained godhood my sparkbolts dealt tens of thousands of damage i was immune to almost all damage then i shot something i hadn t seen before it exploded and i instantly died another time i was immune to almost all damage including explosions i had a wand that shot infinitely quickly i unloaded on an enemy i had not seen before and died instantly as it shot back every time it was hit there is no pain quite like falling from hubris in noita this is the definition of not for everyone but for some of us this game is a masterpiece
