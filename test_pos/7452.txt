2020 this game is very enjoyable though for those that are solo players be prepared for frustration and anger as a new player i ve had nothing but bad experiences meeting other players though they re far and few in between i m constantly being shot to pieces the dynamic events will jump on you at the worst possible times surviving a kraken straight out of a respawn is not possible i don t have irl friends to play with and i think that s 90 of the experience in this game i don t know how i feel about playing with strangers but we ll see i might try signing up for a crew soon enough don t know yet i ve been shot in outposts safezones had my boat sat on fire and you name it it s not a solo friendly game know that when you buy it if you hate pvp well take a guess i ve only played 28hrs as of this review and it s been solo i hope you get to enjoy the game if you buy it edit on 07 06 2020to clarify on whiterabbit s comment i m not saying people shouldn t shoot each other but that i used the first hours of me playing this game trying to learn the mechanics and it was overwhelming i ve been attacked straight after spawning in on new ship while docking for my first voyage while in town the pirate code is just that a code not a rule and i think pve minded players need to be aware of that there s no safe place you can be shot killed and sunk anywhere at any time even as a new player who just opened the game i ve also tried turning my back on my ship to turn in my treasure for like 20seconds i came back and a galleon had docked and sat my sloop on fire they apologized and repaired my sloop and when i was out on voyage again i noticed they had ripped my sloop for every possible resources as an anchored sloop trying to do a voyage meeting a pvp ready galleon was by no means fun and they shot me only for the sake of shooting me this type of encounters can be grueling and very demoralizing new players need to be aware of this because it makes or breaks the game for some of them not everyone is okay playing with other people due to anxieties and playing solo is their only option this game will not be for them i m simply trying to make a certain group of gamers aware that there s no single player version of this game and you won t be left alone out there on the seas solo and single player is two very different things if i m going to play with other people i ll play with someone i know in real life the game does encourage team work and i love that even the alliance system is cool and i know i m making it sound like the game is such a bad thing but i just have to highlight certain events that ll make some people really bumped out about having spent 40eur personally i love the game to bits there s things and details that annoy the living out of me but i understand why it s done as it is the treasure system is fantastic i love the riddles and bounties i love the different factions and that some items can be turned in to any of them for extra experience the sailing mechanics are very enjoyable once you get it down and sailing a sloop alone is almost therapeutic while the game is very linear and grindy it s a joy
