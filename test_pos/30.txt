9 10 for me this is one of the best games in history this game is proof that a project doesn t need battle passes paid cosmetics or in game shops to be successful this is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane starting with one of the top selling points the graphics the graphics are absolutely absurd unreal engine 5 is the best looking engine on the market as of 2024 and this game makes very good use of it yes using ue5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems although they re minor compared to other ue5 titles released recently the combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd elden ring is an amazing game and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety wise every single enemy in this game is unique and original with highly detailed models and movesets there s only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop the game has a lot of different skills and movesets transformations and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter although i gotta admit that i wish it had more spells the biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map this game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration sometimes even on clear paths that look like they d be explorable otherwise and this is the reason i m not giving this game a 10 10 the soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game the osts are magical and epic each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music with different stories and meanings for a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game it s a magical experience for sure i would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in chinese folklore and mythology the story is amazing i was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme and after playing it i gotta say i really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories i genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history
