i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 15 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he let me borrow his controller me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game has helped build my relationship with my son back to how it was before he lost his mother
