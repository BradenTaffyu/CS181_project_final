2015 do not listen to the kids who have played this game for less than 5 hours at least i see a recurring theme and it is that kids who have played this game for 0 2 hours are saying dont buy this game its horrible optimized i have to run my game at low setting even though my computer is worth 500 the reason is because most of the people writing these reviews are either kids playing this on the 200 family laptop or people who are just too damn picky about their game not looking absolutly amazing i have a geforce 650 which is nowhere near the best and i have to run it on low setting i m fine with this because the game looks very similar regardless of how good your quality is me personally if i can get 60 fps on bo3 which i do then i couldn t give a what it looks like if you want this game to look great then buy a 2000 dollar graphics card or you can buy the console version btw ps4 gets dlcs a month earlier too stop giving this game bad reviews because your computer can t run it go ahead and dislike the out of this review just like everyone else that dislikes and kind of positive review
