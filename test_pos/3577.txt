2019 grand theft auto v is probably one of the greatest games i have ever played just due to all the fun i ve had on it whether it was on xbox or pc didn t even matter i always have fun playing it sure there is a lot of modders and tryhards who are out there to make things much harder but you can just leave or go passive then i will admit that something annoying about the game is the fact that it is very obviously a p2w type of situation especially with some of the cars and planes alongside other features like the orbital strike that demolishes whoever it hits the new casino update however is a very easy way to make those who don t want to pay for shark cards have a chance at getting rich one thing i found so much fun on the pc version is that you have access to singleplayer mods i m not talking mod menu wise i mean stuff like the zombie apocalypse mod or the superhero mods which are pretty fun to play around with overall though grand theft auto v is a masterpiece of a game and i hope that the next gta can be even better
