narration audio9superb dialogues and writings depicting riddles and storytelling variety9voyages may have the same ideology but every journey is different re playability9endless possibilities and encounters price8 5only goes on sale during season steam sales but worth the base price as the game is based on pirates who are known for their riddle ish vocabulary and mesmerizing tales there are multiple missions and interactions that are encoded in the form of riddles so i will try my best to explain everything by balancing the straightforward names and in game names sea of thieves is probably the only pirate themed game that is developed and executed marvelously everything from the point of spawn to deadly adventures boosts the gaming experience the game delivers what it promotes a thrilling pirate adventure when you read the word thieves from the title sea of thieves it doesn t mean the threat imposed by other pirate players but from the ai skeletons and deadly sea weathers too so raise the anchor open the sails and cruise through the ocean of dead and alive gameplayspotlight on preparationsafter selecting your closed or open crew and the crew size with the appropriate ship expanse you spawn on a random outpost it s a place where you can get some free supplies a lot of dialogues voyages and customizations no this is not a player friendly spawn point everywhere from the spawn points to scarce islands to underwater tunnels is pvp enabled with no mercy outpost is a good place to frame your journey pinpoints but the sea is always unpredictable so be prepared for everything filled with multiple interesting npcs you can get gold hoarders voyage find the treasure merchant alliance voyages delivery and retrieval of goods order of souls voyages hunt skeleton captains and bring back their skulls and much more from them for the customization part you are also blessed with a big stack of skins for every usable piece of equipment and the whole ship itself not only that but multiple timely events follow the monthly theme there will be an in depth link about voyages in the miscellaneous information section at the bottom of the review start of the journeyafter selecting voyages from a hefty availability it s time for you to grab the helm ship wheel and command your crew to advance for the voyage you will encounter multiple unpredictable confrontations so make sure you have enough supplies to battle the dead or alive now depending upon the voyage you voted for your journey might contain digging up of treasures battles with the skeleton captains or retrieval of goods but the threats of the sea remain the same you can run from the players or volcanic eruptions but how will you run from the wrath of sea weather it s not about the treasure you loot it s about the memories you yield during these deadly adventures this unpredictability is the reason that makes sot alive and immersive encounters from the npc during journeyit doesn t matter whether you are traversing the realm or cruising through the sea you can get attacked anytime for the coast interactions skeletons emerging from the sand wild animals volcanic eruptions are all possible threats but the sea is the deadliest territory skeleton ships ghost ships flying boulders from the volcano a fatal storm are visible from afar and can be avoided if you are fast enough but just coz there s no visible threat it doesn t mean you are safe chilling in the sea and suddenly you hear some sensational music upon looking you see a fierce megalodon chasing your ship with a full force ship wrecking bite if you somehow survive this beast using all your cannon attacks how about a giant kraken that stops your vessel in the middle of the sea and proceeds to damage your ship and suck you up just to drown you in the sea yes the marine shows no mercy creativity and balancing of pvpremember that everyone has the same arsenal of weaponry the players are not always hostile but you never know maybe you are wandering on an island and some pirates sunk your ship don t worry as you can always respawn back to the ship which spawns on the outpost losing a ship only cost you the loot that you were stored on it this reduces the blood thirsty encounters as there s no point in wasting the supply in sinking an empty ship but it s not totally pve as they can steal the loot and deposit at outposts to yield the profit for all the hardcore pvp lovers there s an arena mode competitive where they are assigned a common treasure map and the first one to retrieve and sell gains the silver coins but do you have the guts to eliminate other pirates to seize the treasure graphicsoh my god sea of thieves is the only game i have the most screenshots and clips in it s tremendously eye pleasing all the elements follow the same art design and fit perfectly with the overall mood if there was an oscar for best water graphics sot was the easiest pick everything from player characters enemies landscapes seashores underwater sky elements ghosts animations respawn ghost ship are top notch standing on the bow front part of the ship and staring at the flowing water is a magical feeling that will make you calm and speechless even going out of bounds turns the sea blood red and damages your ship like a deadly curse it s surely deadly but beautiful pros and conspros best pirate game available out there top notch graphics endless content multiplayer availability cross play fun and exciting no pay to win itemcons bugs that get your characters stuck until you kill yourself pvp is a gamble either you can get good pirates or blood thirsty chasers tips to new players always maintain your supplies to ample amount you can only hold a limited number of voyages and they reset once you leave the game so make sure to buy the voyage that you are looking forward to completing buying a voyage flag boosts your rewards but it s not permanent you will lose your flag and perks once your boat sinks also staying afk will end up disconnecting from the server miscellaneous information voyages voyages are the quests that players can buy from trading companies or the black market at all outposts for a further look at the possibilities of voyages please check out the link ratingall my time with sea of thieves was enjoyable and pleasing this is a must have experience for everyone i tried my best to cover everything but the game has to offer much more than that truly a masterpiece that has engraved a happy memory in my heart don t wait for the sale just buy it and play with friends rating 10 10 volcanic islands
