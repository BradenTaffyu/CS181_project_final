2017 early access review wallpaper engineso my first impression from the title itself was rather mhh lets say interesting so i watched the trailers which steam had to offer the trailers actually just show a little part of whats possible in this its a really really amazing eninge and i dont see the money i ve spent as wasted no it was worth the money and since there is a workshop for it and lots of talented people uploading their work in its even better there are a few issues with the audiodetecting wallpapers since when i use my razer kraken chroma 7 1 it only detects the sound from my microphone basicly what i say but not the music without it works perfectly but this is the only thing which bugs me sometimes maybe i just need to change some options and it ll be fine anyways i really think this is a great engine worth to buy its such a simple idea yet its so briliant really i hope to see more content for wallpaper engine and i think it has a long way to go but in that time i wont leave it i will join and see where it will go to my rating is 10 10 looking forward to more
