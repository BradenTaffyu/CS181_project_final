2017 straight out the gate i d like to clarify something gta online is terrible it s badly balanced badly designed and the team is charge of it have a contempt for it s users i even got banned for litterally just lagging at one point and i am now perm banned for money exploits ban was fair perm wasn t that however does not change gta v being an excellent game one of the best ever made in fact the online is an extra and is not and should not be the main focus of the game the world r have created combined with the excellent shooting driving and just general gameplay make it an incredible experience the story is weak esspecially compared to gta san andreas however that doesn t change how incredible the experience is don t let the bad reviews made you think the game isn t good it s just people justifiably annoyed about the poor online experience
