some games have a learning curve noita has a learning cliff you ll be hard pressed to find a more unforgiving game you either play for 3 hours and give up because you don t understand a thing or you sacrifice your sanity for a peek behind the curtains as the game puts it the sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge is the highest tribute to the gods but when you when you get the god run that would put buddha in his place the world is your playground literally entering parallel worlds for your own advancement nothing can challenge you then enters polymorph then you turn into a flying sheep die and question life if i were to give words of advice gain the knowledge to exploit the game mechanics or it will exploit you the game balance was designed with you needing to break the rules there won t be another game that gives you as much freedom as noita offers for a very long time for the wand building completely unparalleled magic system and no other game even comes close to scratching it genuinely leaves morrowind in the dust it s kinda sad to think that the magic system is so ahead of it s time because i don t want to have to wait 15 years for something similar to pop up
