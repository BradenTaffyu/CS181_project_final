2021 naraka is personally a 10 10 game for me most fun pvp game i ve played in years i have over 1000 hours in pubg and apex legends but this game does not really feel like a traditional br it s more like a fighting game somewhat similar to mordhau while being hands down the best action combat melee multiplayer game i have ever played and i ve tried several the overarching br element takes a lot of inspiration from apex legends while feeling different enough to not feel like you re playing the same game pros every weapon and every hero is very well thought out the souljade system adds a lot of variety in gameplay each melee weapon has a variety of options for attacks and combos that make the game not feel repetitive instead becoming very addictive and rewarding for improving in the skillcap is not that high so even new players have a chance against the best players in the game if they read a few games and get enough practice unlike other games in naraka you never feel like you can t beat even the sweatiest player the grapple and free climbing system is absolutely amazing considering that you can grapple and climb almost any object you see it has the best animations i have seen in an action combat game and its not even close even subtle things like shimmying around corners has its own animation the game does not feel janky at all unlike other games i have played recently new world bf 2042 beta elyon i have not encountered a single bug like falling through the map getting stuck glitching through objects etc which is remarkable considering you can traverse and climb everything the textures and model designs for the heroes weapons and environment are fantastic the audio for each weapon and hero abilities makes them all unique and you can easily tell what is going around you the ui is very intuitive minimalist and easy to use the gameplay is very fluid and you can even cancel animations without the game feeling janky or glitchy the downsides the downsides of the game have nothing to do with the game itself all the downsides come from the player base the most complained topics are meta picks region switching long queues strange ranking system but all of those issues all boil down to a low player base at least in the west difficulty is the other issue this is a game that will turn away a lot of new players because those who are experienced will smash their face in it is a hard game to start as you will get rolled a lot but for those that stick it out they will hopefully see what a masterpiece this game is and lastly many players complain about the rng lootboxes the lootboxes are purely cosmetic there is no pay to win in the game let me repeat no pay to win in the game incredibly refreshing for an asian developer the shop has plenty of great skins that can be bought outright to balance out the best cosmetics being locked behind rng you can play the entire game without being disadvantaged for the base price the only thing locked behind a grind are the glyphs but it takes only a few days to get all glyphs maxed out to be on fair ground with all opponents and teammates i have played many games this year that were an absolute embarrassment particularly new world and bf2042 beta in terms of gameplay fun and fluidity i primarily rate a game based on how fun it is to play and for me 99 of that comes from the gameplay not how shiny the environment is in naraka everything works it feels great to play its a whole lotta fun if you invest the time to get better it feels rewarding to duel someone and come out on top or hunt someone down third party get a multikill a clutch play a snipe a satisfying ulti etc the game feels incredibly well made and i think the developers put a lot of thought and love into everything i wrote this long ass review in the hopes that more people give it a shot it s a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the west and i really appreciate that there s still some developers out that are focusing on gameplay over glitz and glamour
