2022 sea of thievesnowadays this is the best pirate themed game in my opinion there s no game perfect all games always have their own pros and cons the game had a terrible start it had minimal game content the game was very boring as there was nothing to do the only thing that might have been fun was fighting with other players and now after four years the game has become what it should have been since it was released seamoon community created artwork for sea of thieves by crist masu pros let me start by saying that the game has a great pirate atmosphere this is one of the main advantages of the game because it s hard to find a good pirate themed game these days and there are still no normal releases each player does what he or she wants to do there s nothing stopping you from raiding an enemy ship or just sailing around the islands in search of adventure content compared to the beginning there is a lot of content in the game although i admit i would have liked more content pleasant relaxing graphics in addition the optimization is at a decent level sea of thieves a screenshot of sea of thieves by dragon ark cons the game is time consuming it takes a huge amount of time to get to another island small number of enemy types this game needs more variety in terms of enemies sea of thieves is a strictly co operative game of course you can play alone but you ll quickly get bored with this game i advise playing in a party with ur friends or at least online with random people sometimes in the arena or while searching for random people to play you have to wait a long time community created artwork for sea of thieves by ciki i m dishonest and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest honestly it s the honest ones you want to watch out for because you can never predict when they re going to do something incredibly stupid sea of thieves is a great game with a promising future it has a lot to develop and i hope it will become the benchmark for pirate games in the next few years
