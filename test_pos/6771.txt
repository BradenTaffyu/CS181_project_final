2020 hola to the few random people scrolling down into the comments and reviews im home from school today so ive decided to write a review on one of my favorite games im gonna be breaking this review up into different categories on the three main gameplays and the bonus ones zombies multiplayer campaign and the bonus mode also i just hit my 300th hour on the game so i think im somewhat qualified to talk about this game also this is my first review so i would appreciate some criticismzombies 1 gameplaycall of duty black ops is notorious for zombies they revolutionized with every new installment and took a different turn with the release of black ops 3 black ops 3 included two new main additions that carried over with every map gobblegum and double pack a punch and each map had their own unique features gobblegum was a contreversial addition for the reason most people thought it made the game too easy and wasnt necessary but i beg to differ gobblegum adds another path to take with the game another way to approach your run you could either play without the gums that carry you throughout the experience or you could do my personal favorite and complete the easter eggs in 1hr moving on to the next addition double pack a punch pack a punch was a staple of all zombies and treyarch took a turn and said lets make it even better dpp allowed for infinite damage making high rounds attempts effortless and much faster inscentivizing the player to continue playing and trying out different abilities that best suite their gameplay style 2 map designthe map design of every map is similar in the fact that you can go either left or right to reach your objective like i mentioned before each map has its own unique features for example gorod krovi my personal favorite this map has dragons manglers drones more dragons robots drunk russian and a flying eyeball and thats barely scratching the surface you dont need to be a veteran to understand or interact with the features of the map 3 easter eggsevery game has their own little easter eggs that you can do to maybe get a secret weapon or some bonus currency but black ops 3 says you look at what i can do every dlc map offers some sort of easter egg that you want to do shadows of evil or commonly seen as soe is the base map the one that everyone starts off with this is a four player easter egg and the objective here is to defeat the shadow man repent for your sins and obtain the summoning key you have to perform for rituals collect souls get a sword kill margwas which are based off of hp lovecrafts cthulu mythos then after that you have to defend a flag while meatballs go at it at full speed then the final step is a bossfight with the shadowman himself you pour 100 s of bullets into him hoping to defeat him only to fail and have to try again the easter eggs are so interesting and each deliver some sort of small message to the player 4 the storythe story is by far one of the most interesting stories ive seen in a videogame which is saying a lot this story isnt some carbon copy thats used in every game its its own new idea that jason blundell made and a story that i think everyone can appreciate the four main characters are takeo a japenese warrior that cares only about honer dempsey who loves to tell you to drop the chips richtofen basically hitler if he was a scientist and nikolai who is on his ninth wife these heros go around from dimension to dimension attempting to restore reality 5 replayabilityyes this game keeps you coming back for more you always want to improve your time in easter eggs always want to find out how to optimize certain routes and wanting to go for higher rounds if you get really good at the game you also can join multiple discord to help people that just started 6 conszombies is an overall great experience but not everything is perfect one major downside of zombies are the graphics in some areas of maps sometimes a map will look phenomenal but then you move 5 feet to the right and it looks like a potato another bs thing in some maps are the dumbass mini bosses that come every few rounds tedious easter egg steps and zetsubou 7 final verdictcall of duty zombies is amazing i didnt mention custom zombies because thats not part of the main game like what treyarch made thats more community fueled i would recommend this game to everyone for its great story good graphics and overall fun gameplay its fun on your own but even better with friends granted it has its flaws but what game doesnt multiplayer1 gameplayme personally im not a fan of bo3 multiplayer its super pay to win so in any encounter whoever has the better gun will win this is a lot less skill based and the meta rarely changes you could call me bad at the game and i would accept that but there are a lot of over powered weapons that really ruin the experience but one new addition to the black ops series was rocket jump boost if you double tap space bar you can fly up for a short time the downside of this is it makes noise and alerts others to your position 2 map layoutthere isnt much really to say about this since every map is mostly formatted the same way there are two lanes one on the left and right and there s a middle part with some obstacles on all three paths your spawn changes throughout the game to prevent spawn camping and most maps have a window in the middle to camp in 3 specialistsone new addition that was in bo3 s multiplayer was the ability to have specialists specialists each grant you and ability that fills up throughout the game with each specialist you can choose between one of two abilities usually one passive and one that more for attack you can also customize the appearance of your specialists with crates that come from the black market which i ll talk more about later 4 black marketthe black market is how you get cosmetics and dlc weapons you can either spend money to earn crates faster or you can just do missions and play a lot you can win either common rare epic and legendary you can get emotes skins camos paintjobs and emblems 5 final verdictmultiplayer is personally not my favorite but ive heard mixed review on it you can load into a game and have the best time of your life destroying everyone else in the lobby or you can get unlucky and walk into a prestige master level 1000 and start throwing things if you get bo3 i would still recommend giving multiplayer a try maybe thats your style or what youre good at campaign1 gameplaythe campaign is the worst out of all of the black ops granted thats purely subjective but its just bad the only positive thing i can mention about it is that its fun to screw around with it but only with friends the bots are super easy to kill unless youre playing realistic theirs no incentive to go for collectibles class selection and loadout is pointless because it takes so long to level up your guns 2 storyhorrible just bad i couldnt follow it at all and honestly i just couldnt give a crap about any of the characters involved the person you play as isnt likeable and isnt relatable and i gave the story a try but i couldnt follow it there are just too many things going on 3 map designthe map design is different every time but the layout is the same theres an open area outside the you go inside the after that you have to go outside again maybe take control of some robot then go back inside just to go outside again 4 final verdicti dont mean to cut this short but i reached the world limit lmao overall bo3 is an amazing experience and i would recommend this to literally everyone to give it a shot if you made it this far thank you and i would appreciate some criticism on my review also i didint have room for the bonus review but just know that its fun thanks again papa
