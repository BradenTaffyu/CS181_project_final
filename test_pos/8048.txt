2019 early access review i died because of a fireball i died because i drowned and just a minute ago i fall after my spell rebound i died because of poison on my pretty robe i died cause i got frozen sliding down a slope i died cause i got bitten by a sneaky little spider its a pity that down in the mines there s no healthcare provider continuing the saga i just burned in lava i try and try i am resilient and this game is bloody brilliant
