i love pasta i love classic pasta with red sauce and i also very much enjoy white sauce or buttered noodles i m really not picky however when i order a supposedly new and exciting dish on a fancy plate covered in garnishes only to find i ve actually just been served last week s reheated leftovers i m less than impressed in that same vein call of duty modern warfare 3 s multiplayer modes are fun comfort food gaming and i am enjoying the mayhem with the return of some classic maps like highrise rust and afghan but i cannot get over the feeling that it s more of a map pack for modern warfare 2 than its own spin on the series ideas and that s a letdown compared to what call of duty has spent years training us to expect from a full sequel sure there are some quality of life changes in gameplay mechanics in modern warfare 3 but they come along with some questionable progression tweaks that certainly don t make it better and i m not feeling like the time i ve invested has been rewarded as much as i d expected
