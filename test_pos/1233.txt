it s a great game but i can t help but feel disappointed and disillusioned with the direction in which they re taking these games these games now have such a large focus on boss fights specifically and the combat still isn t particularly interesting or deep to engage with you re still just rolling attacks and counter attacking with little depth and variation possible there is still a large divide between spell casting and melee combat now with a more prominent third option being summoning that being through spirit ashes there have been attempts to lessen the divide between these playstyles but they re still so far removed from each other that the difference in combat between them is practically another game bosses have completely meta game attacks that have unnaturally long startups to throw off your dodge timing excessive tracking obvious input reading obscured attacks due to visual effects or have such a specific way to dodge them that i m no longer sure they were even designed with a deliberate defensive maneuver in mind all of the bosses still suffer from a variety of technical issues and other issues that were mostly already resolved in sekiro losing lock on being unable to lock on to bosses even though it s an analog choice input buffering still being inconsistent etc there have been definitive improvements to the combat ash of war jumping crouching stealth horseback and stance breaking are all notable additions but their implementation all leaves something to be desired spell casting also didn t get as much of an improvement and still feels clunky and antiquated with the way you cycle through memorized spells critiquing the implementation of the open world feels wrong as it s relentlessly impressive and in many ways the best part of the game considering it s their first attempt it s incredibly commendable and it s led to some of the best moments i ve had playing their games that being said it s disappointingly formulaic and isn t particularly interactive either a lot of the time it serves as a large impressive landscape to meticulously comb over so as not to miss anything meaningful since the meaningful stuff is packed right in there alongside some of the less meaningful stuff the intended progression path through it is also unintuitive and leads to you easily to being underpowered or overpowered this game really is a sequel to dark souls 3 more than anything i didn t like that game much for a lot of the similar reasons i have issues with elden ring with each new game they release in this style we lose more and more of what made them so unique in the first place some of the most unique features and ideas of the earlier games never got the privilege of refinement this game really is great but in a lot of ways it s far removed from what made me really fall in love with the originals and that just always leaves a bad aftertaste
