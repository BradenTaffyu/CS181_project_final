2019 nolite te bastardes carborundorum3 5 5 my feelings about warframe are decidedly ambivalent on the one hand it can be a lot of fun on the other it can be a soul crushing grindfest how you react to this will depend entirely on how much you can tolerate the endless mission replays needed in order to get the relics drops you require in order to build that next weapon or frame and what for just so you can rinse and repeat but as i ve already said it can be a lot of fun at least for the first few hundred hours i loved it for 350 hours but now i find myself increasingly disinclined to play it although i expect i ll dip my toe in from time to time but what about the game itself well in general i m not a huge fan of the f2p model there are one or two notable exceptions usually the developers struggle to make it work but warframe is probably as good an example of this type of game as you re likely to find these days in many respects de have got it right it is possible to play completely for free although i would encourage players to buy some platinum i have as de deserves to make a buck or two for all their hard work playing for free can put you at a slight disadvantage but only when playing with players who ve bought higher level weapons and frames success lies more in the mods you have available and how you use them than in anything else personally i ve only used my platinum to buy additional inventory slots as a large part of warframe is the farming for and building of new gear and here s where the grind comes in it goes on and on and on and as i ve said it can be both tedious and frustrating warframe is also the most complicated game i ve ever played mainly i suspect due to its having been developed and modified over such a long period be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to fathom out what the hell you re supposed to do and then there s the gameplay itself this is where warframe scores most highly the movement and combat mechanics are excellent every weapon and there are so many of them has a unique feel lots of them are just levelling up fodder but they re all fun to use the same applies to the frames of which there are approximately 60 at time of writing of course there are keepers in amongst the chaff and these weapons and frames bring the most enjoyment the parkour style movement is well implemented and very satisfying once you get the hang of it the mission types are limited but the main story line does offer some relief from the routine and is deeper and more fleshed out than the stories found in many aaa paid for games the community is good for the most part a git gud attitude does exist to some extent but it s not prevalent all in all warframe is an impressive achievement it s a well designed game with lots of content and it offers a good deal of enjoyment it s just a shame that it s marred by the dispiriting grind recommended with the above qualifications i thank you
