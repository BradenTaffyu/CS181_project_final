2014 update steam awards let s all nominate for labor of love warframe is the epitome of digital extremes ethos a living project that has been cultivated year after year no other game or developer has come close to what de has done with warframe are you a fan of dark souls are you a fan of monster hunter then i would highly recommend giving warframe a shot this game is the best of both worlds bringing difficulty and fun gear collection to the forefront of free to play games without requiring any money to be spent contrary to popular belief first glance after delving into the deeper aspects of what this game has to offer i am without a doubt mesmerized by its beauty and presentation the overall design and scale of this game has been a welcoming experience as i am tired of most games lately the same cut and paste formula used from one game unto another yes warframe is based loosely upon the sci fi genre but the way digital extremes has gone about creating this particular universe and breaking the mold of every other sci fi game has been much appreciated on my end the strange and unusual that pushes others away from this game has drawn me closer and given me the desire to learn more about its unique direction key aspects this game has a lot to offer i will admit that i was one of the original beta testers that walked away after closed beta the fact that the game only had two different tile sets and lacked content was an immediate turn off but now after returning many months after my last login i find the game has grown substantially thanks to the community developer relationship which in respect has gained a lot of traction due to the various features that keep veterans from the community and development team going what this game has to offer is simply boundless once you ve peered through the veil 280 procedurally generated missions which include standard missions alert missions randomly generated location and reward infestation missions guaranteed reward invasion missions guaranteed reward x3 challenging boss fights void missions private instances earned via key drops orokin derelict missions nightmare modethen we have character progression limitless ways to customize your warframe via mods limitless ways to customize your weapons via mods clans and clan hall building clan research for clan specific gear materialsand with each patch there is a special event that takes place something big and eventful that ties into the lore and awards players with unique gear that can no longer be collected after the event has ended talk about gratifying pitfalls the only drawback i see this game having is with people and their lack of patience if you ve made it this far into my review then by all means get to downloading it should be mentioned that most crafted items need to take 12 72 hours in real time also using revives is limited you can only carry a set amount of revives and when you re out you re out until you gain another one one per 24 hours on the flipside all gear and warframes can be attained through gameplay and the only things platinum real money need to be used for is additional weapon slots warframe slots and aesthetic items earning platinum through the game is easy as well selling rare mods to other users is an easy way to attain this currency in order to make the small purchases you need to maintain your collection of warframes and weapons therefore real money from your wallet is not required to help alleviate confusion while playing keep this warframe wiki warframe wikia com close by understanding from the moment my friends log out i find it interesting how the community in this game thrives aside from the recruiting chat channel to enter hidden zones with a pre formed party there is little to no communication between users it s as if there is an unspoken language between those who have survived the tutorial and beginner missions experienced players in most missions have zero communication and there is a strong sense of synergy as if role playing our speechless tenno comes with the experience and territory conclusion i feel most people overlook this game by the sheer fact that their first experience was miserable and they didn t take the time to give this game an honest chance from the surface it s overly complicated and doesn t hold your hand but for those who carry on that is the draw that is the appeal set your own goals and the game will become very rewarding what are you waiting for masterful tenno persevere while the inept are left to drown
