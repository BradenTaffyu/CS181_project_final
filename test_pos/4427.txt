this game this game is one of the only games i keep coming back to despite me wanting to not go back to looking into the abyss from fun gameplay loops to amazing devs to probably the most customizable game ever it s got it all my total time has been around 3k hours but just got back to playing on steam for achievements and what can i say this game is a treat if you lime playing a space ninja that s a part time fisherman part time miner part time space battleship captain and more then this is the right game for you the game has become unrecognizable from a couple of years ago because the amount of stuff you can do you can play for hours and not run out of things to do which could be detrimental sometimes but nothing is really mandatory customization is this game is outrageous the color of your ship the color of your warframe the color of your pets the color of the trail you can leave behind to an absurd amount of cosmetics you can get outrageous amounts of customization done hundreds of weapons melee weapons pistols etc you can mix and match to 40 warframes and make some unique customized loadouts all of this for free basically besides some cosmetics that are paywall all weapons and most other things can be farmed and obtained for free one big con this game is not new player friendly as i said the game is 100 free to farm for all the weapons warframes the premium currency platinum but it s not good for beginners as of now the game takes about 50 hours of gameplay to become an addictive game the first 49 hours though not so fun the quests in the beginning also need a huge rework because the later parts of the game has quests that compete with some of the best quests in other games the first couple quite lackluster would i recommend heck yes it s a phenomenal game with a phenomenal dev team that does their best and makes the best
