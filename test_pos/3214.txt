been playing this for many years and have always loved it as well as the other gta games i love the characters the people who play the characters and i thought the story was pretty good i only really play story mode and never really was a fan of online mode especially with rockstar milking the hell out of it but despite that i still love it and play it i played it on my sisters ps3 beat it on my ps4 and will continue to play it on my ps5 and pc with mods until gta6 that is anyway that s my review and remember michael was never in witness protection
