2022 in a sentence fun but conflicted and shallow at time of writing there is no doubt in my mind that sea of thieves is the pirate adventure experience it s got everything i want from such mermaids grog treasure maps sea monsters and an abundance of hidden burried sunken treasure as well as the rare interesting and nervwracking player encounters a la dayz but it suffers from several major problems that keep it from being a true gem the combat overall can suffer from hit reg issues but is otherwise fine ship v ship pvp however has major issues primarily because of the ships in short the small 2 man sloop is the best ship in the game the 3 man brig and 4 man galleon are slightly faster have way more cannons and are much more imposing but in reality they simply can t compete with the sloop s maneuverability meaning the game actively punishes sailing with a larger crew then there is the issue with conflicting player desires some people are here for fun naval combat some are here for a fun adventure on the seas some are here to be the terror of those seas the problem comes when those meet when i ve just spent an hour going through a story voyage hauling the treasures i fought tooth and nail for the fastest way of ruining my experience is to be ambushed by hardcore pvp players and cordially invited to eat dirt while they espouse my mothers enjoyment of their big bananas frankly the game needs community servers there is so much in the game that would benefit from actual in game communities like the alliance system burying treasure and the new seaforts that can be maintained as temporary player bases once cleared but that s apparently not on the board there is also exactly nothing in the terms of endgame and i don t mean i expect them to put in some kind of world boss actually that would be freaking sweet i m more referring to the fact that this game about plundering golden treasure has practically nothing of interest to spend it on once you ve bought all the promotions in the different factions and bought all the cosmetics you like there s nothing to put your money into besides making more money there s been talk for a long time of the fabled captaincy update that would let you make your own customized ship and help you realize that fantasy of being a recognizeable crew with your own reputation but it s been teased so long that people have started treating it like a myth currently the big goal for those dedicated is the dark adventure set of cosmetics that are certainly cool looking but also arbitrarily expensive a good session of looting might net you around 50 000 gold and sure you can get a basic hairstyle option or makeup pattern for like 200 000 gold but the basic tunic will run you over a million if you want a full set of clothing along with the weapons that s gonna run you close to 20 million and the ship set is close to 40 and it s not even the the coolest looking set you can buy the game rewards you with small amounts of premium currency from time to time a design choice i can t praise enough so if you just save up you ll earn enough to buy a cooler looking premium ship set in the countless hours it ll take you to grind the money for dark adventures to sum up fun until you ve gotten to pirate legend and done the story voyages and world events then you ll pretty much only have roaming pvp and a pile of money with nothing impactful to spend it on
