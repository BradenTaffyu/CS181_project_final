2023 hands down undoubtedly the game of the year the sheer scope and grandeur of the game along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched among the very best that games have to offer it plays as a truly great game for the first 2 3rds of a typical playthrough after which i am dumbfounded by how sharp the drop off is how can a game provide 40 hours of near perfect experience and be tarnished by 20 hours of uninspired and truly baffling decisions at the end from poor use of repeated content and poor late game balancing to truly boring and at times truly unfair late game bosses it s frustrating how sullied my experience is with the game because of how padded and unnecessary certain sections and bosses during the late game were youtube video essays such as joseph anderson vg matthew and neverknowsbest s do a great job detailing these more than any review you will see here this game is well worth playing it s an experience that almost universally is agreed upon as near perfect at least until the late game however the joy of finishing the game is simply not there for me i didn t feel that sense of triumph in overcoming adversity and culminating in a fitting end to the story instead i am simply glad that it is over along with botw this has shown me what a truly great game is like at least in some aspects i am glad that this game has inspired me to get into playing more singleplayer games where competitiveness is not the be all and end all 8 10
