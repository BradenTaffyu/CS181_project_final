2022 never played a souls like game before elden ring and let me tell you how regretful i feel elden ring is a master piece the scenery the gameplay the story the characters everything is very well built you embark on this adventure as a maidenless tarnished on a quest to become the elden lord on your way you ve got to defeat the enemies that don t want you to even dream about becoming the elden lord you ve got dungeons you ve got area bosses you ve got day night bosses the demigods aswell a massive map to explore tons of different weapons to use and tons of ways to go on about the game loved every second playing this and even after 2 years i catch myself coming back to the game to give it another run its a hard one but the satisfaction you get there s nothing like it totally recommend it 10 10
