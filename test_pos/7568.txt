2023 ok so the primary reason you d not enjoy this is because of the squeakers the waves of little prepubescent wetpups completely lacking house training are my only real complaint here squeaking along the high seas doing things their tiny little minds find entertaining which is essentially squealing they are friendly then shooting you in the face and giggling about it short of this annoying and usually avoidable nuisance this is a very satisfying title the core of this game is sailing with the hunt for lootables and returning them safely to a vendor the underlying prime directive along the way you ll be faced with debilitating rain squalls with a smattering of shocking lightning strikes starting fires on deck bouncing off islands you didn t see in time resulting in holes torn all along yer larburd bow laddie infestations of bony pirate hating skellingtoons ghost ships rising out of the depths to challenge you unspeakable horrors lurking below waiting to hinder your progress and claw at your sanity and even a a few player ships who might choose to attack you at your lowest or come to your aid this is all played out in a simple yet incredibly effective visual style the graphics and cpu requirements being an xbox port are very low to achieve streamlined performance at max settings is not a great leap even for a dated machine however the implementation is most impressive with constant moments that are screenshot worthy and a truly immersive environment the key component to effecting this is the wave modelling lurching along then screaming your way down the backend of waves or calmly puddling with a cross wind pulling your vessel to full heel is an incredibly satisfying experience while the game itself is wildly open ended with tons of fascinating little islands hidden grottos undersea shrines temples fortified outposts sunken wrecks and other special locations to discover and explore there are also organised activities along the lines of tall tales and event quests that appear in conjunction with the games seasons currently in its 8th iteration tall tales are what one might term campaign missions and while the lore and backstory of the area we are playing in is provided through these there is also a superb pirates of the caribbean tie in with good old captain jack sparrow and the rest of the movie characters showing an appearance while many believe johnny depp was used to voice the iconic wobbly captain it was in fact a voice actor by the name of jared butler i challenge you to detect the difference mr butler has voiced depp s part in other cartoons and video games including depp s mad hatter character to circle back to the seasons these have been used to further major plotlines as well as game dynamics with the 4th season introducing an entire new island and faction for example while the current season has organised ship vs ship pvp queues that result in your vessel diving beneath the waves flying dutchman style to emerge adjacent to your matched enemy for some swopping of cannonball holes ship combat has some unique additions to what you may be expecting from similar titles while the standard hurling of wirling iron is the primary combat choice your cannon may be filled with firebombs shrapnel shells chainshot cursed balls forces dancing or inebriates entire crew and even yourself or your pets launching yourself out of a cannon is the most effective if aimed correctly method of boarding enemy vessels and while you have harpoons at your disposal climbing a ladder out of the water will most likely result in meeting a blunderbuss to the eyeball as you clamber on deck all player combat is on an equal footing as the 3 gun options and sword you have on first spawn are the only ones available in game the hp percent taken per weapon is sword 25 swing 75 thrust flintlock pistol 55 eye of reach sniper 75 blunderbuss 10 shells 10 eachfor those that find pvp a hinderance to game enjoyment it is 90 of the time avoidable once you learn how to be aware of your surroundings simply scanning the horizon will alert you to potential threats and using chat to ask people their intentions can be effective once you learn that most squeakers are idiots however if you are accosted on foot dying will respawn you on your vessel if it is still floating after a quick visit to the ferryman the different vessels are threefold sloop 1 2 person crew turns fastest and when sailing directly in the no go zone headwind is the fastest ship in game 2 cannons brigantine 2 3 person crew possible to solo but tricky has medium turning speed and is the fastest on a broad reach 4 cannons galleon 4 person crew really hard to solo and tricky with 2 has slow turning speed and is fastest on a dead run 8 cannons this obviously translates as well to pve ship combat vs skeleton crews tall tales events and ghost ships as well as other things overall a personally suprising title with something for everybody a very affordable steam price and longetivity to boot arrrrrrrrrrr for more reviews and rantings march over to my curator page the imaginings of a gamer
