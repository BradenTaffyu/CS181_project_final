2018 early access review i got this as a gift from a friend more than a year ago i ve been using it ever since both on my desktop and on my laptop it s purely brilliant and well optimized it barely uses any resources of course that also depends on which wallpaper you re using and what settings it ll give your desktop a great feel it will bring it to life wallpapers are easy to make or you can make some in after effects or you can just download them from the workshop there are thousands of them although i d recommend to use the discovery tab in app otherwise you d be riddled with anime wallpapers if you just browse the workshop on steam there are also web wallpapers game wallpapers with little games you can play whenever your desktop sees the light of the day if you ever minimize your windows which rarely happens in my case it can also stay hidden so you won t appear in game while using it and you also can play or do whatever you want on steam at the same time i was worried i won t be able to do that at first it would ve been a very big design flaw it s very worth the price you ll enjoy it and you ll have an awesome desktop
