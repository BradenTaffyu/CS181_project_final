2022 i think people miss the core point of this game pros large map with plenty of content for both pvp and pve players alike insane amount of quests and objectives or just motive to sail freely and explore a great deal of depth an equal playing field when it comes to ship combat loot a non aggressive mtx system which is cosmetic only incentive to learn and get better at the game graphically it is utterly stunning developers who care and are constantly updating the game cons now take these with a pinch of salt because there is plenty of it there is one meta for ship combat and that is boarding as long as you can deal with that then you are fine a hard game to play alone wouldn t mind subscription based private servers a small portion of the community ruin the game for others toxicity look sea of thieves is a damn good game don t let a few players sinking you destroy your experience that is the way they want to play it and fair enough each to their own the reality being that if you plan ahead if you stay out of sight and play smart then you can normally avoid combat if you wish to do so also you will find that over 50 of the players you come across their one meta is to try and board you they are not good at the game and you can deal with them fairly easily other than that it is about being smarter than the toxic idiots just like any game since online play was invented think about it in mw2 when some lovely person was spamming noob tubes what did you do you would get out a sniper rifle and take care of them or you would change your strategy to make his strategy useless my point being that there is way to play around idiots if you do get into ship combat then play it smart keep your distance and play your way in time you will learn to counter the idiots but at the end of the day the game is both a pve and a pvp based game if you get frustrated easily or feel you cannot make plans to avoid these things then sure don t buy it but the reality being that i have had whole sessions where i have not seen someone else there are so many ways to make money and have fun that you can avoid the hot spots make your own game this is sort of what rare want you to do anyway although i feel private servers to play on with friends against npc s would be far more enjoyable i also think getting rid of arena was a mistake because sadly it put the toxic lot back into the main game in closing i feel that this game has so much to offer and you should 100 ignore the negative reviews they are just from people who played the game incorrectly and didn t use sense or have any understanding of what a live service pvp game is play your own way have your own fun and do what makes you happy 9 5 10 and i will stick by that no matter how many times i sink which most of the time is down to my own stupidity and not to the fault of somebody else i am just big enough to admit it
