warframe division combo with a lot of grind and nice waifus grind is quite comfortable if you are into that kind of gameplay the game give you clear way to see what you can grind and where dont need a bunch of wikipedia pages just to understand wtf is going on the prices for cosmetics are a bit too high but that dont bother me anyway also at least the first battle pass is really useless the devs though are listening to the community and resolving issues very fast if you like grindy games first descendant can be your thing for sure
