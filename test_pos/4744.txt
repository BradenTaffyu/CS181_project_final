2023 one of the best multiplayer cod experiences yet will take time adjusting to but with a new cod each year this one really is unique in both setting and playstyle by far some of the most beautiful graphics and map design ever you can tell how much detail was taken for production the movement is fast like mw2019 but the setting is so on point with major world at war vibes bringing some nostalgia especially on the asian themed maps i believe negative reviews are coming from cod haters of players who havn t adjusted yet but from someone who has played every call of duty since beginning this one brings in great game play a refresh with a unique vibe and some of the best performance and memory utilization yet especially on pc bravo this one will catch on soon once people adjust and i see reviews rising steadily
