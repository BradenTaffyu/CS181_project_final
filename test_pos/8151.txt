noita is an incredibly unique roguelike one that has an incredible amount of depth and requires you to get fully engaged with its systems to truly succeed you can reach the deepest level and beat the final boss relatively easily but that s only the tip of the iceberg the game is expansive and full of cryptic secrets and puzzles and becoming powerful enough that you can mostly freely explore the world and figure them out is only the first half of the game within the game s main loop are also the two main systems that make it stand out wand crafting is essentially dragging and dropping blocks of code combining hundreds of spells and modifiers to create nearly infinite tools and weapons with the right creativity and a wand with generous spell slots and mana you can make almost anything you can imagine but it might also blow up in your face or melt you with acid the other main system which is what makes it so dynamic and fun is the physics and alchemy system every type of material in the game ranging from water to wood to various densities of rock to metal and coal has different properties everything interacts and you can interact with it to use the environment to your advantage and this means being smart about how you navigate the world is half the battle these systems combined with the world being procedurally generated on each run incentivizes you to be creative and take different approaches on each run you ll need to be creative because noita is hard opportunities to heal are scarce and enemies can kill you in seconds if you re not careful experimenting and exploring beyond the main path the game encourages you to go down give a real sense of discovery and are some of the most fun parts of it however the amount of time you can invest into a run only to die and have to start from scratch also makes it frustrating if you don t want to invest a lot of time if you re willing to though there aren t many games as rewarding as noita
