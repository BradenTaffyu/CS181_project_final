2016 my grandfather smoked his whole life i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you have to stop immediately tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake he gave it up immediately three years later he died of lung cancer it was really sad and destroyed me my mother said to me don t ever smoke please don t put your family through what your grandfather put us through i agreed at 21 i have never touched a cigarette i must say i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway 11 10 would get cancer again
