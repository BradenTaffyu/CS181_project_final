you are a wizard who is dungeon crawling through a mountain collect random spells along the way to eradicate those that dwell inside and most likely yourself in the process reach the bottom where the final boss and its treasure awaits or die and try again this is a brutal unforgiving game which has a lot of surprises excitement and self expression creativity it s going to be rough in the beginning as you play you ll get a better understanding of your hp thresholds and when to explore versus when to push forward to the next safe area steam workshop mods can assist with finding the fun if the game is too punishing i recommend some of the noita content creators to help bridge the gap between beginning and getting your first win there are many spoilers in the game so be cautious when looking up content creators if that matters to you however knowing of spoilers versus actually achieving spoilers are two different things this is a niche game so you may not mesh with it most of my hours are on the steam deck which handles the game great
