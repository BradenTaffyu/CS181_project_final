2022 i am not going to lie this game is a masterpiece you can play solo or with friends and the experience is overall great the graphics are well optimized and stunning especially the clear night sky the sound design is fabulous and the devs still continue to try and make this game even greater via their updates whether you are a casual gamer who plays few hours a week or a hardcore farmer ready to reach the skies there is content for you however tonight i had another bad experience with some players of this game there is a company called the reaper s bones which goal is to fight and sink the boats that belong to the other trading companies well after farming it for several hours and dodging a server hopper people hopping into a server and leaving instantly if there is no loot stacked onto a ship in order to go find it elsewhere another one came to the server chasing us while boasting you are reaper come fight us then sinking themselves in order to make us think that they left the server and then coming to our boat sinking it and watching us die without even trying to steal and sell our loot the problem is that if they accepted our alliance offer we both could have gained some precious coin instead of fighting to the death the lore of this pvp faction serves as an excuse for these players to rapidly switch servers until they find a huge stack of loot that other players accumulated and to go sink them i already hear regular players reading this review and thinking well why did you became a reaper if you didn t want to fight my answer there once was a pvp mode called the arena where the only goal was to fight against the others this mode was removed sea of thieves then became a full pvpve game with necessary farming to get those juicy cosmetics especially in this specific reaper s bones pvp faction and while these toxic players spam the excuse of a pvp faction i raise my right to do pve in total tranquility please devs do something to prevent server hopping i won t be playing this game for some time
