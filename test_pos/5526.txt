2015 this game encourages mic communication so much that it will force enable your mic to always be on even if you have it disabled causing everyone in the game to hear whatever you say even if it was only meant for your friends over skype gg no privacy out of 10 this has been fixed kinda it still happens to other people on occasion this game s servers are so powerful that they can manage to keep 10 players connected flawlessly with next to no lag in an endless loading screen that pops up 80 of the time when joining a match unable to exit all you can do is open task manager on the plus side you can still talk to everyone while all of you chill in purgatory so essentially uplay made a group omeggle with the rare off chance of actually playing a game
