2023 honestly the only bad part of this game is the beginning it s very slow and getting a good new weapon could take you upwards of up to 5 10 hours of gameplay and that s not including the crafting time other than that it is a fantastic free to play game even if it was like 20 i would still recommend it it s a classic but don t let other people talk to you if you don t think the game is for you it is a grindy game but the grind is pretty fun
