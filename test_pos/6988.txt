2020 the campaign sucks and the multiplayer sucks but the zombies alone makes this one of the best cods out there with all of the dlc the game has 14 zombies maps so you won t get bored any time soon but on the steam version we have workshop support so custom maps are back and people are still making maps now you ll never get bored i used to play on xbox one so coming to steam and seeing all these custom maps was an exhilarating experience i still think 100 dollars for the game plus all the dlc is way too much for a five year old game even 60 for the game plus zc is too much so i d wait for a sale but if i m being honest because of how mediocre the dlc maps are and with all the custom maps out there i d just get the base game it s worth it solely for the custom maps tl dr it s worth it for the zombies alone
