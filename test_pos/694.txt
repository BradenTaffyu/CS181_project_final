2015 great game that can teach you many things such as 1 the russian language 2 how to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen 3 how to be racist and sexist 4 how to be spoiled as 5 how awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch 6 how to be disappointed in human beings 7 how to socialise in a civilised and calm manner s and last but not least how to be a complete for no reason at all aside from that if you re willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game it has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible you could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all it is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic harsh and often rude as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose it s a good game and i do recommend it as long as you re willing to ignore the admittedly plenty of things that are wrong with this game even if you don t it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilize if you got the balls really self deprecation humour
