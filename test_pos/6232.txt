2016 recommended inspite of the the flawful system that made up my disappointment on this game yes i would still recommend it the measurement of fun i had in the last 30 hours of this game is euphoric well i am not entirely a huge fan of horror games but this game gave me countless heartbeats and moments of relief i am very much astonished with its unique uncomplicated 4 vs 1 concept dbd is obviously rushed and still imbalanced with all the loads of bugs plus the game s non existent party system which complicate the game itself infinite and crappy loading screens errors in joining the lobby getting stuck glitches in map with more cons in its pros and cons i do hope the devs would work on the game asap the game has so much potential if you don t want to get disappointed don t buy this until huge improvements are done just wait til this game is perfectly polished but still 8 5 10
