2023 there are exceptionally few games that i can recommend to the degree that i recommend noita the sheer amount of possibilities in this game is wild you can summon oceans of sawblades evaporate entire biomes or teleport across worlds there s no wizarding game where you feel as powerful or godlike as you do in noita while still being able to be instantly killed by all sorts of random mechanics you could never realistically never have foreseen this contrast is also what makes the game so fun being an omnipotent allmighty wizard holds no meaning if it s something you easily accomplish every restart the mechanics of wandbuilding in this game are so intricate that very few understand even half of it but you don t even need to understand all that much to have a great time the only negative thing i can think of is that there s not enough of the game although there s still probably upwards of 200 hours probably more if you do the longest quests in the game should you never consult the wiki with that said there s also quite a few content mods to be able to continue playing there s no reason to sit on the fence for this one
