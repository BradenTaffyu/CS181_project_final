2022 really neat engaging combat though skill gaps can be pretty big sometimes really fun playing with friends and even has custom lobbies called rooms where you can invite people tweak settings although it s really time consuming to unlock customization skins very much rng i d definitely recommend if you enjoy getting into action combat quickly i will say that it can be competitive and has a high learning curve if so desired
