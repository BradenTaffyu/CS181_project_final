2022 it s amazing it s everything you ve heard it s open world dark souls please play this game however i m quitting before the end here s why as briefly as i can put it it s too hard not like oh it s challenging git gud it s too hard as in the bosses towards end game even some of the regular enemies rely on exceedingly long combos with aoe s that will kill you in 1 2 shots many feel cheap rather than challenging not quite bed of chaos cheap but pretty close i m feeling like when i die i didn t cheat the system or find the right cheese rather than build any skill for the next fight i m discouraged i hate the gauntlet of having to dodge 12 times flawlessly and hit once then repeat or just summon a bunch of people and cheese the bosses it s not fun any more i quit
