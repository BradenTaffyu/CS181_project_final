2021 easily one of the best if not the best game to be released officially in 2020 noita makes the player suffer horrifically at first to the point where it feels like you ll never grasp how anyone makes it past the hiisi base however perseverance is it s own reward and after about fifty or so grueling hours of agony you ll begin to realize that you ve been doing it wrong noita affords the player a great deal of agency no matter what rng deals them it just comes down to learning how to use it properly you can spend hours tinkering with wands to try to find the perfect combo or just something that will let you live to the next level in the hopes of finding a better combo or spell greed is often the downfall of most players as they try to push beyond common sense and then die when they should have moved on once you start to grasp these concepts a lot of the difficulty melts away and most deaths can be chalked up to some genuine bad luck or a split second decision that went the wrong way for people who love to suffer and enjoy pressing on and beating the odds when the game tries to thwart them at every angle there s no more rewarding a game than noita and you never forget your first win
