2017 just thought i d add i cba to change my review it s grind theft auto nothing is grand about it anymore pre ordered it for console full played it and loved every moment of it tried completing everything that i could adventured and admired even got a game guide artbook thing brought for me then i caught wind of it being released on pc but i knew that my pc couldn t handle it at the time pre ordered it regardless and loved it all over again even on the lowest of settings now i ve upgraded and i can love it to it s full extent i ve played nearly all gta games and this is one of the ones that i have thoroughly enjoyed the online aspect really does add extra depth it brings new things to do and own that aren t in story mode sometimes the community can be a let down e g you re trying to steal a top range car or deliver stock and you get killed and your stuff is blown up it happens but you can recover either way this game is beautiful and it doesn t seem to get old fast i ll always enjoy soaking in the atmosphere of this masterpeice 11 10
