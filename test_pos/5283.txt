2017 disclaimer if you re a csgo addict like me but may get triggered by things that you don t agree with in terms of r6 siege s pros and cons feel free to ignore this review this game is gifted to me on my birthday by the one and only damien hooray after spending hours upon hours playing this game as a csgo addict i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed this game of course i will be explaining this review in a csgo addict standpoint mainly because i am but i will make sure that other people can understand this despite some cs references here and there rainbow six siege is a tactical team based fps game that manages to have some sliver of what i wanted from a tom clancy s game tom clancy s rainbow six games have always been games that emphasise on tactics rather than skill even though you still need to have some skill in order to ensure that you don t fall behind while the later tom clancy s games like future soldier and phantoms deviate away from what tom clancy s is all about siege manages to somewhat evoke that tactical gameplay that tom clancy s rainbow six was all about like the older rainbow six games the game is all about exposing yourself as little as possible to minimise risk as well as to ensure that your enemies die quickly before you do while siege isn t like the older rainbow six games where you die in one shot it doesn t take much bullets to kill you anyway and regardless of what weapon you re using enemies die in one hit to the head and so do you this is one of those games where headshot is king and you ll do your absolute damnest to ensure that your head isn t anywhere near their crosshairs lest the spray inevitably hits you in this game your environment and surroundings matter to you a lot any breachable walls is going to have holes which will give away your position if you aren t too careful players have a nasty habit of blasting holes in walls to provide greater dynamic in how they can execute their enemies rather than barricading them which seems to be the meta in this game heck walls are a facade for safety in siege as any wall can be blown up suddenly when you least expect them or be filled with holes by a hard hitting rifle or a shotgun or even a sledgehammer you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings to ensure that nothing is out of place that you aren t vulnerable to fire or explosions and that anything you do to the surroundings works to your favour any player can make any wall work in their favour with a little ingenuity and a few well placed shots the environment in siege is possibly the coolest because unlike battlefield where you can blow cover up gratuitiously or unlike csgo where it s actually impossible to do such things you can shape the environment to ensure your enemies die in the least expected way this also keep maps unique while staying the same siege has operators which have special abilities unlike the recruits that you would normally play if you can t afford an operator all of these operators have their pros and cons and ubisoft has done a great job balancing them although some operators do require a buff for example tachanka was an operator that had a deployable stationary mg when the meta game proved that tachanka would be far too easy to overcome due to how stationary tachanka would be in his mg ubisoft added a tacked on shield that covers the sides of the mg to provide cover in both sides except tachanka s head this ensures that anyone using tachanka s deployed mg would not be so vulnerable that he she would be a sitting duck while still giving enemies the incentive to go for headshots to deal with a deployed mg user the same can be said for blackbeard when he was released with a special ability of being able to equip a rifle mounted shield when it proved that he was a tad op due to how much the shield was able to absorb damage his shield was then nerfed and he was given two rifle mounts instead of just one resolving the issue needless to say ubisoft has done a satisfactory job of balancing each unique operators so they they re all somewhat equal the game modes are nothing to write about as far as i m concerned you have three game modes pve pvp casual and pvp matchmaking pve is basically you or a team of 5 against a swarm of enemies where the number of enemies depend on the game mode terrorist hunt defuse and hostage rescue pvp casual and pvp matchmaking are exactly the same only casual has fewer rounds at just 3 wins max while matchmaking plays in a span of 15 to me this is something csgo should ve been as casual is nothing like matchmaking when it comes to csgo otherwise the game modes are what you ve come to expect in a game like siege as for the community it s actually pretty clean i ve not met any salty or jerk players like you normally would in csgo probably because this game isn t as accessible or as appealing as csgo so most of the time servers are filled with fun going players who probably don t have qualms making silly mistakes as long as you re having fun yourself it s a fun community to be in and i love it though your mileage may vary i do have a few things regarding siege that i am not too fond of the new operators that have been added post release requires a hefty amount of renown to unlock you can unlock them instantly with r6 credits but r6 credits require real money and therefore isn t a thing if one plans to use the money for other more useful things although you can buy all the new operators in one bundle for a discounted price this is still unacceptable as people have already paid a good amount of money to acquire this game in the first place this wouldn t be a problem if you have played the game since day 1 as the amount of renown that players collected would be enough to purchase all of the new operators with renown alone another issue is the offline functionality as of right now there isn t any the reason why csgo is still ranked highly in my list is due to that you can still play it offline meaning i am still able to sharpen my skills with modded bots if i ever go anywhere that isn t the sanctuary of my fiber optics internet with siege though you always have to be online even if you re going lone wolf in pve which is quite a shame with offline functionality i would ve rated this game higher provided the offline functionality is reasonable enough as of now i keep a pirated copy just for that occasion that it might happen and it will happen if you travel a lot like i do oh and unstable servers sometimes i can t connect to servers or play with friends at all ubisoft fix this will ya overall there isn t much to complain about except for the cons i ve listed above like csgo you still feel the adrenaline rush when you score a kill and the nothingness and silence that occurs in the game can be unsettling and sometimes unnerving like you would in csgo however siege deviates that from csgo as it offers a unique experience unlike csgo it is inherently a better game than csgo i will admit i do find myself playing this game more often despite how much i don t want to admit it put it simply it s a game and it s a damn fun game
