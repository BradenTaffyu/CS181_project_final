2020 product received for free just want to keep it short i don t like most battle royal games but this one is good the reason being that its fast paced environment elements are like any other battle royal games pros its fast paced lots of skins lots of different legends player operator to choose from 33 40 operators are given for free and others you can unlock by just playing the game graphics are good haven t encountered any cheater yet idk must be there but i haven t encountered any training mode gives you brief on controls and game play mechanics good for beginners its free xd cons still lags on lobby games crashes between games and also some time gives network issues sometime puts onto server with very high ping literally teleports the legends on map xd above are my thoughts you want to know play it yourself as it is free as a beginner you must play the training mode before you start with match it s a lot more fun with friends and worth a try shant x out
