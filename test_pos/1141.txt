2022 well now that i ve beaten it exactly at 100 hours over the span of 3 4 weeks i think i can give a penny for my thoughts elden ring is great the scope of the the world is expansive and daring for fromsoft to challenge in comparison to their previous games i d say they nailed it the world is pretty fun to find yourself wandering about and finding meaningful content that such as loot quests lore etc of course if you re not an open world fan i can see this still being a game that you d be reluctant about playing however i d say give it a shot if you can and see it for what it is like there are various ways of tackling elden ring you can spend your time exploring and getting more stronger and making things more accessible or you can choose tackle only the legacy dungeons areas that are more traditional to the souls games and enjoy it that way any and every way you choose to tackle elden ring are all valid don t let anyone else tell you otherwise there s also pvp which i ve only done a few hours doing and well it s a mixed experience for me especially with players spamming the same build moonveil or rivers of blood katanas at soul level 150 but perhaps you can find a better experience than me with pvp later on as more people experiment more with builds the game also has some glaring issues performance most of all being the worst offender even after the patches i m running a rig quite above the recommended setting and the game loves to dip frames below half of what it s capped at being 60 it gets incredibly frustrating when your fighting a boss then your frames decide to tank making you vulnerable to hits and possibly ending your run doesn t happen often but when it happens it s noticeable another thing i d have to say is a pain in ass is the camera there are many times where d you have to fight the damn camera since it loves to adjust automatically especially when you re fighting giant bosses on torrent your mount it s very frustrating and was not an issue in the previous fromsoft games ds3 bloodborne because it was a setting you can turn off aside from these two main issues i have with the game which are fixable i think it s a very enjoyable game and a good entry point for newcomers to the fromsoft souls games definitely worth 60 if you ve got the rig for it have fun and git gud oh and of course ranni best girl
