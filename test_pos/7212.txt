dragon s dogma 2 is a 2012 game dressed in 2024 graphics it s a decent game but you should only pick it up on sale in my opinion here are some pros and cons to summarize my thoughts on the game open world exploration there is always a cave to explore a chest to loot or a boss to battle you ll spend dozens of hours immersing yourself in dd2 s open world as it s the shining star of the game combat the variety of vocations classes dd2 has is impressive from melee focused classes like the sword and shield fighter who excels in drawing out enemy attention and climb on bosses to ranged classes like the archer who is best at targeting specific parts of bosses to dexterity based classes like the thief who is fast and can steal items from enemies to magic wielders like the mage who can offer boosts and healing spells to your party not to mention advanced vocations that add more unique playstyles graphics not really much to say the re engine proves once again that it s one the best engines in the industry pawn system just like the nemesis system from shadow of mordor pawns are underrated and should be added to more rpgs pawns hired will support players in guiding them through quests catch them when they fall from heights loot and hold items as well as finding treasures and caves that you may have missed my only two gripes about pawns are a they need more meaningful dialogue and b i just wish capcom would expand on the system further add co op or the ability to give orders to pawns like shooting locks or boost the players to reach unreachable locations ai the ai of pawns can be bad at times one time my pawns stood around during a boss battle not targeting the specific parts needed to defeat the boss i was fighting as a trickster which made the fight literally impossible also a few times i was pinned down or stunned and they ll watch you suffer in silence the bad ai made me quit using the trickster and sorcerer vocations story pretty bare bones story with weak writing performance bugs the game is poorly optimized for the cpu side of the game as evident by the major fps drops in npc busy areas dd2 is the first re engine title with high density complex npcs so performance issues are to be expected hopefully capcom will work on cpu optimization more because i can t see how monster hunter wilds will perform with the same issues dd2 is also quite buggy there is a chance to bug out of side quests like the game did to me save system being able to save anywhere is great however capcom s decision against adding save slots is a stupid one microtransaction you don t need to buy any but still there is no reason to add microtransactions in full priced 70 games
