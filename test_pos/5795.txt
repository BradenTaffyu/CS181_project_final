2016 this game is really damn good siege provides room for usage of tactics and clever positioning where map knowledge is key as well as moments of pure visceral action once all hell goes loose during a breach the core gameplay is extremely enjoyable dlc content is all free for everybody with season pass owners skipping a rather easy grind for renown to unlock dlc operators the only stuff that is not available for in game currency is some of the camo patterns for your guns which hold absolutely no value apart from cosmetical update most of the network issues are fixed and the new anti cheat system is very effective in the recent updates some more paid for cosmetics were introduced such as headgear and uniforms but it s still limited to just that cosmetics year 2 support has been announced too
