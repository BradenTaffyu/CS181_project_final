2022 let s be honest you didn t buy this game to play crappy realms of chaos campaign instead you bought it to play the complete version of trilogy as immortal empires its going to be finally here on 23rd august and i can finally move from warhammer ii where i have almost 2000 hours to warhammer iii this is gonna be epic which will keep me occupied for another 4 years like the previous game in the series did the only negative i can think about it at this point is if you are coming new to the game you need to buy tww1 and tww2 and all of their dlc s to get the full experience in immortal empires and altogether you are looking at over 200
