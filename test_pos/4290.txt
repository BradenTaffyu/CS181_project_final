2019 i started playing this game back in 2014 ran it on a netbook at 800x600 30fps after the tutorial i immediately quit the game and said to myself its overwhelming and i need to think about it i revisited the game anywhere 6 months later with a friend and we had an absolute blast through fighting the jackal first intro with stalker farming alad v to get valkyr and many more experiences that 2014 15 warframe had to offer i remember crafting tiered void keys and going into void survival in hopes of getting the all elusive forma which mind you we were absolutely ecstatic to even acquire back then lol and getting small little prime parts we surprisingly had no idea what to do with we struggled to try to expand the clan with every forma going into our little clan station to build an awesome setup that we would use forever then everything changed when during a uranus survival mission my good friend ran into a sentient drone scanned it as this was that whole scanning enemy phase that every player goes through where you basically spend an entire mission running around trying to collect all the scans before we knew what helios was xp and told me to scan it as well we blindly followed the natah quest and the scope of the game expanded before our very eyes we had absolutely no idea that story quest even existed let alone how to acquire it soon enough we had completed the second dream we looked on the forums to which school to pick and both went with madurai for the chest laser because back then each school had a different ascension power like thing you could activate this was before the war within update came out so thats where the story ended fast forward to today i ve cracked over 1 500 hours in warframe and more to count with empyrean coming i will most definitely still be playing for years to come as this is a game i grew up on steam with i am amazed to see how this game has expanded over the years where most games would stop updates or would move onto a second game warframe in particular has evolved and adapted every year while keeping a strong and close relationship with their community which in this day and age isn t something you see very often overall i strongly reccomend this game its addicting i had a friend say this was this generation s wow which doesn t seem too farfetched its got an in depth and complicated story spanning a massive amount of characters and interactions sub plots and smaller stories that intertwine with each other to make this huge universe its gun play movement and ability use is satisfying it blends overpowered weaponry with occasionally challenging gamemodes and a rewarding atmosphere for a farming mmo its community is wonderful and friendly theres always a few bad apples as every game has of course i can confirm this game can be confusing and overwhelming for new players but i hope those who are interested in this game will 100 give it a shot and experience a game that has been crafted with passion and memes by an amazing development team who loves to interact with their community i m excited and ready for warframe s future
