i am a player who pre ordered this game so i carefully paid attention to the shortcomings in the reviews of this game by media such as ign but after playing for 5 hours i can responsibly say that these reviews are crap they claim that the game s plot is boring there are too few enemies there are too few skills there is not much collection etc it s all the only point is that they didn t play this game seriously from beginning to end they played with an arrogant attitude of course they couldn t discover anything or feel anything bro play this game seriously and to your heart s content it will definitely surprise you last but not least don t have too many concerns about the performance of this game even if you set the picture quality to medium you can still enjoy a great visual experience
