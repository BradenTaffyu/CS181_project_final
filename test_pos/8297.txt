2019 early access review this is how you design a roguelike game the game is everything they promised and even more my hope is that they improve the game to make it even bigger and better the gameplay is already incredibly fun but things i d like to see are different starting characters with pros and cons think about binding of isaac optional boss miniboss vaults more spells more perks more levels this is already a fantastic game as it is right now let s hope they can make it into a masterpiece edit every new update seems to add new spells and perks and the latest one was also mentioning a secret boss
