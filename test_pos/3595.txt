2015 coming from someone who has played the pc port of gta iv believe me this is a great port for the next instalment the price is still pretty expensive and i would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you can t wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore gta fan i would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles ok now time for the pros and cons pros good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters graphics is very good and i would strongly recommend playing it at at least high settings try limiting the drop to normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots nonetheless it really got my attention most of the time and future dlcs will definitely make it better voice acting is superb i love the voice casts in this they really suit their own characters bravo r director mode is pretty fun its a pc exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings there are limitations though such as dialogues etc and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode i usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lolcons online as with many others i find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat sometimes you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye garage bug yup i am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game it doesn t happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved carsall in all this game is still great on its own i would suggest gta fans to get this for neutrals maybe get at a lower price
