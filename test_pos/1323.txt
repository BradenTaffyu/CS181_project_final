2022 genre souls open world game with summons runs great on my 3 year old pc variety of weapons and foes character creation at start looks sweet fast travel map helps a lot feels like an open world things to discover as you go a limited but useful guide on direction of travel active community at moment long may it continue summons can be smooth summons can be temperamental early bosses seem a bit too hard even with 2 summons feels like it might need too much grind although that s fun at the moment to progress in some areas you literally have to take a leap of faith can be difficult to spot your lost souls i mean graceoverall i m not disappointed by what i got on release day although it s not perfect
