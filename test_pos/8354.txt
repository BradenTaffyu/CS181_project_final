2023 i finished the game after like 5 hours of playing that was the only time i made it to the end i am lost in the rest of the game because reaching the end it s just scratching the surface i have died a thousand times some quick others after really good runs but i keep coming back because the game is new every time and a novel challenge if you can stomach the almost unfair dificulty sometimes a mistake can take a third of your health in one shot or kill you outright so you learn and come back and try to do better it s just fun to try new things and go crazy
