2020 initially i started playing rainbow six siege back when it was released i absolutely loved the game especially as a fan of competitive shooters like cs go i have since then came back to rainbow six siege multiple times as it s just a blast with friends rainbow six siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks at the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense while the attackers get time to scout the level and see how the defenders are setup both attackers and defenders have multiple operators 52 total at the moment of writing that can be bought with points that are earned in game each operator has it s own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style the cool part about this is how in depth everything is all these weapons gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team not only this but it s just awesome to zip line on buildings blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps the graphics are good especially for an older game and sound design is amazing sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial so to sum it up would i recommend this game yes ofcourse but you do have to like competitive shooters however good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like cs go as it s more about strategy
