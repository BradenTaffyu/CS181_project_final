elden ring is arguably the best game in the series delivering an expansive and fascinating open world that s a joy to explore the landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful truly some of the best visuals seen in gaming each area is packed with secrets and challenges that keep you engaged for hours the bosses are a standout feature they re brilliantly designed and offer a tough but fair challenge although a few do repeat throughout the game devs really nailed the climactic feel with the last two bosses both feel like true final bosses and provide a satisfying end to an epic journey i enjoyed elden ring so much that i couldn t stop until i had unlocked all the achievements it s a masterpiece that s not to be missed
