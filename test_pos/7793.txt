2021 genre pirate ship co op with pvp and pve elements edit you can vote to scuttle your ship to stop spawn killing still think you should have some protection on spawn and you should be able to flag yourself out of pvp in adventure mode warning established players will spawn kill and farm points off you especially after the rest of your team quit you also get put in a sin bin for leaving games early they need to balance out the obvious flaws in pvp like there being no spawn buff and discourage farming points off weak or new players they also could do with a dedicated pve mode however after the first 3 hours it s pretty fun and i m looking forward to organising my own crew with rl friends the graphics are cartoon like but still pretty there are varied tasks to keep your ship afloat and a few different ways to earn points other than spawn killing other players you can unlock fun cosmetics easily by playing playing multiple games didn t feel any grind it is 0 10 p2w although there is an in game store for cosmetics
