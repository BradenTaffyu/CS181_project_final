2021 why do we want to play rainbow six siege is it because of the operators no because of the being a team player no but because your every action will have an outcome either positive or negative every decision will matter your heartrate will not stop increasing the operator you chose to play with will be immensely important regarding your personality tactical espionage there are many things that will matter in this game for god s sake stop comparing this game to cs go both are totally different games only the main scenario is same which is actually good both games can be equally like by both communities other than gameplay mechanics and whatnot there are many more things to be discussed but mostly my point of view regarding this game as a competitive shooter is really vast it has a future worth investing in but i don t really know even what is going to happen even in the next second so choose wisely 8 10 because this game had ups and downs and will have ups and downs
