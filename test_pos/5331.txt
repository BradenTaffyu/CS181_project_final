2021 alright so i have 400 hours in the game now and i think i can now fairly write about this game so siege is in my opinion the best hardcore fps i ve played siege is not casual there is a lot of fun to be had if you put in the time and because of its so serious nature siege is difficult to get in to you will get spawnpeeked you will die instantly you will feel frustrated maybe even all the time but when you get a hang of it when you start learning from your mistakes when you start learning the patterns in the strats you will realise how rewarding the game is you will need to invest a lot of time a lot of brain power a lot of patience and team work you cannot survive without team work even if you frag out and have 15 kills you will still lose the match if you don t have team work even if you have average raw gun skills but you have good team work and game iq you will perform much better compared to someone with more gun skills and less game iq and team work in my opinion the more time you give to siege the more fun siege will be gg ez mates
