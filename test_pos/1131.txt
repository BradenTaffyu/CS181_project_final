2023 after over 300 hours of getting killed i think i can now qualify to make a proper review on this game the only con i ve got is that the quest system is very confusing i got locked out of so many npc quests i later realized that there are online guides to help aide you for these quests everything else is a pro i am a type of person that just sticks to what i know and that s swtor because i ve been playing it for years been part of the same guild for years and i m a late bloomer when it comes to games so i ve never really ventured beyond that but nothing has prepared me for elden ring and when i started playing elden ring all hope died hope as in real life because this game will suck many hours of your life but you will love it i fell in love with this game elden ring it is also my first game i properly play for souls i admire how you can explore and you don t need to no rush on boss or story you have freedom to collect and loot and enjoy every single dungeon and kill all that comes in your path and do this game at your comfortable pace enjoying the beautiful views you see along the way the scenery is beautiful the music is beautiful the voice acting is beautiful i love everything about this game i started playing it thinking i could not progress because it was too difficult for me but now i am wearing malenia s armor and blobbing along having as much fun many hours later as i did when i begin highly recommend beautiful game
