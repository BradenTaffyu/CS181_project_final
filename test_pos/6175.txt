2018 what is dead by daylight most similar to dead by daylight is most similar to friday 13th with some differences such as that dead by daylights maps are all procedurally generated for each match there s more survivors in one match in friday 13th and friday 13th only have one killer but with different weapons dead by daylight is also quite similar to deathgarden from the same developer it features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate kill runners dead by daylight is however the best game in the genre right now gameplaya simplistic way to describe dead by daylight would be to say that it s a cat mouse game you either play as the killer and try to stop the victims from escaping or you play as one out of 4 survivors trying to escape when playing a survivor you need to repair a certain amount of generators in order to power up the mechanism that unlocks the exit once all the generators are powered up you need to flip the switch that opens the exit escape apart from activating the generators there s also the obvious goal of surviving and trying to save the other survivors if they ve been caught on a hook your chances of winning are greatly enhanced while all of you are alive when playing as the killer you try to incapacitate the victims so that you can lift them up and put them on a hook the goal is to sacrifice them to feed to the entity the entity is some sort of demonic force in the game while one victim is on the hook the remaining victims still run around trying to repair the generators so your best course of action is to try and chase them down and hook them as well when the match is over your performance is graded and you re handed a certain amount of bloodpoints that you can spend on new gadgets offerings and abilities for a killer or survivor of your choice killers survivors itemsyou have a lot of options when it comes to selecting your killer or survivor there s currently 13 killers and 14 suvivors each one with its own unique set of skills and abilities on top of that there are a lot of gadgets offerings gadgets help you in some way as a tool and often has a limited amount of uses offerings change how things will be played in the match they could add thicker fog seperate survivor players or enable the killer to insta kill survivors rather than having to hook them for example in combination with the map system it really mixes things up and makes matches feel fresh rather than the same thing repeating over and over again difficulty imbalancethe matchmaking is generally pretty good and the difficulty obviously varies depending on the skill of your opponents relative to your personal skill it is however my firm belief that this game was never meant to be played with friends over voip as the killer there is a huge difference in difficulty when you compare playing against a pre made group of 4 victims with playing against a group of 4 randomly matched victims in dead by daylight there is no in game chat or voip so whenever you play solo survivor you will not be able to communicate with the other survivors if you play as a group you can communicate with the other survivors in a 3rd party voip software this obviously gives the survivor team a huge buff since they can tell eachother where the killer is or what he s up to it really feels imbalanced when i run into pre made groups as the killer it makes me wonder why the developers did not adress it by giving randomly matched survivors a way of communicating buffing the killers to balance it out i ve seen many other players that main killer say that they evade pre made groups because of this aside from that some killers feel a lot weaker than others but it s hard to say for sure since it could all come down to playstyle you never know what the new meta could be mapsthe map theme is randomly chosen then the map itself is procedurally generated at the start of the match and each map is more or less advantagious depending on what survivor or killer you re playing there s plenty of themes it works well and keeps the game fresh no complaints at all serversthe servers are p2p that is an issue that cause several problems the killer is always the host of the session and since it s a p2p architecture that means that his machine holds all the information about the ongoing match it means that the game is suseptible to lagswitches cheats and even simple things such as the killer disconnecting if the killer disconnects using alt f4 all of the survivors lose their gadgets and offerings because the p2p server is no longer available to tell the main server what items they retrieved or used in the match behaviour gave their new ip deathgarden dedicated servers and i hope they do the same thing for dead by daylight sooner rather than later with that said it s rare to run into cheating killers or laggy matches it works well for the most part toxicitytoxicity is arguably one of the greatest problems with dead by daylight the post lobby chat that pops up only serves as a punching bag for the frustrated players that feel like they ve been wronged in one way or another if you do not engage in the chat you will often recieve messages on your steam profile from angry players who feel like you did something cheesy this happens very often no matter how you play the game i dont really know how they could solve the issue but the chat should be removed completely from the post lobby it serves no purpose but to give other players abuse some way of encouraging other players would be a step in the right direction as well perhaps a tip button of some sort i dont know but they really need to do something to lighten the mood enforce punishments on players that take it too far verdictit s the best game you can get if you re looking for an asymmetrical pvp game the upsides greatly outweigh any downsides
