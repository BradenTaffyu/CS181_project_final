2018 for those of you who played before 2016 take note since the second dream s release warframe has been extensively given a lot of love and care and is beyond a mere game s worth of content for those who are new ever wanted a free to play game that s actually not pay to win warframe s it despite looking like a pay to win at first glance warframes and weapons can be built from the blueprints in store and the blueprints you earn either in boss fights or the materials you find playing naturally in game prime warframes and weapons can be earned through void relics and easily traded for platinum the game s premium currency in an economy that easily makes it possible for completely free to play players to enjoy the game s cosmetics and easily gather the resources they need with a little effort everything takes a short amount of time to farm and a long time to cook but if you pace yourself well you can accomplish a lot within a week of playing this game once you re past the early hours this game doesn t hold your hand however expect to get confused with the modding and forma system at first but it s a satisfying learning experience reminiscent of 90s gaming where you actually put some bloody effort into your games combat is fluid free form the parkour system is genuinely fun to use and fits well with the fast paced combat of the game digital extremes who have history in aaa gaming before this the darkness 2 was a great game if not short are consistently providing their love and support into the game alongside informing the community of their future plans for the game hands down i would recommend this game i mean my friend s got 7k hours on it so clearly she must find a reason to keep playing it since launch
