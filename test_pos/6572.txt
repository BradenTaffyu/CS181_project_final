so a lot of negative reviews and i felt this game and its developers deserved much better than its current score so here s my review i had been waiting for something to scratch my warframe itch and tfd did it very well i ve got over 400 hours and plan to play for a while longer the developers are aaa in terms of modern developers who connect with their audience this team is from korea and have gone so far that they stay late at the office their time so they can push updates when its not prime game time they listen everyday to community chatter and patch based on what the gamers see as fun not sticking to what they created thinking its the best they value our input and have changed the game drastically to make the game actually fun completly wiping out mechanics they thought were good but not so much in practice within a week of season ones opening they patched most major complaints and fixed the rest in hot patches i believe the actions of these developers are why arrowhead of helldivers 2 has rapidly been buffing for fun its what the gamers want i think enough about the developers though at release the game had a few hiccups in terms of balance but have since buffed many classes that needed it as well as buffed many guns in many ways making many new meta builds you now see descendants using different guns and even builds the grind to get your gear has been tuned way down maxxing out your first descendant and gun takes a little but once you have a farm build you can start unlocking things very fast just today i unlocked two new descendants because thatch what i was focusing also had some amazing rng but many days i get side tracked with randoms other things i just decide to do i just find doing the different missions fun swapping up descendants and trying different builds you really do feel the power as you level up i would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys the journey more than the destination to me its not about being absolutely meta its about enjoying the gameplay loop and im finding so many fun descendants and weapon combos to try out the thing is there is a big variety of descendants and weapons that are considered op now bosses endgame become more mechanic based than tank and spanks so its not so important that you have the biggest gun or highest dps its very important that you know the fight they give ample time for bosses but because most people don t know mechanics they shoot and fill the rage bars up when they shouldn t and wipe the party flashback of wow raids lolthe community is mostly console but they seem to be more chill than the pc players i encounter there s one of two people you meet in dungeons bosses missions the guys who look at a team and leaves based on teammates the min maxxers or the crew who sticks it out with whatever team to beat the objective in my experience then random mix match non meta teams have been the funnest
