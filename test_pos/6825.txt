2020 while the multiplayer is almost completely dead i 100 recommend this game for those who love either cod zombies or those who love survival games the custom zombie community for this game is enough to keep you coming back i sunk all of my playtime into zombies alone as i bought this game only a few months ago and it is an instant favorite of mine when i have some time and zombies to kill
