2021 i adore this game and have bought it for a few of my friends that i thought would also enjoy it they did at its core this is a game about learning and discovery you must find combinations of spells that you have found to be effective in your hands and keep those in mind as you delve and search for ingredients in the form of wands and the spells within them it is like learning crafting recipes in survival crafting style games except there is no recipe book and you can put any of the ingredients you want together to see what you get once you have twenty or more combinations that you are familiar and proficient with it becomes much easier to conserve your hp while searching for even better ingredients essentially this is a game where knowledge truly is power the more you know and understand about the game the easier the game becomes the game doesn t hold your hand through the learning process because that learning process is the game this is easily my favorite game that i played in 2020 i hope you give it a try and enjoy it as much as i have
