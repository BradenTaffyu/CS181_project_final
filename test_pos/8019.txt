2022 i was an ice mage with the ability to freeze any liquid that came near me poison spewing creatures surrounded me i blasted one in the face with an icicle then ducked around a corner leaving a bomb behind me the two remaining creatures turned the corner and in an instant they were blown to pieces coating the room with a poisonous substance confidently i approached the body of my first victim the one i d stuck in the face with an icicle my small prize awaited atop its body a single golden nugget nothing special but i sure as hell wasn t complaining when i stepped upon its body to pick up the nugget the weight of my foot squeezed some toxic blood out from the wound that i had created the poisonous blood squirted right into me and immediately my frozen aura congealed it in place around my own body i couldn t move and some of the liquid had frozen around my face creating an inescapable death mask within seconds and out of nowhere i was dead turns out that having the power to freeze liquids around you has some downsides and that pretty much sums up a big part of the game accidentally killing yourself with your own badass abilities easiest 10 10 of my life
