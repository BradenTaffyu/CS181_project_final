the first descendant takes a lot of its inspiration from warframe with a sprinkle of destiny 2 as someone with 1 900 hours in warframe and thousands of active hours in black desert i m very familiar with the looter shooter genre and the typical korean game grind i finished the main story around the 40 hour mark and have been grinding end game content ever since i find the game enjoyable so far with a well implemented mix of warframe and destiny elements similarities to warframe descendants in this game are essentially your warframes the descendant and weapon upgrade modding system open world missions are inspired by various game modes in warframe mastery rank and player progression similarities to destiny various weapon types that use different ammo eight open world zones in different biomes instanced infiltration missions enemies and missions drop weapons and gear of similar levels randomized perks for weapons and gear advantages over warframe research time is significantly shorter most research can be done within hours eliminating the over three day wait to build your warframe the game provides ample weapon and descendant slots right from the start so you re not forced to spend money to manage your growing arsenal unlike warframe which primarily relies on a peer to peer hosting system the first descendant uses dedicated servers for all gameplay you will never have to worry about losing your mission progress when the host disconnects built using modern technology and unreal engine 5 the game offers good graphics and even ray tracing while optimization might need some work at launch the potential is certainly higher compared to the decade old warframe disadvantages compared to warframe the in game shop is quite expensive a regular descendant costs about 6 to 18 while their ultimate versions cost 60 each items equivalent to forma and orokin catalyst are harder to obtain and more expensive to purchase overall the grind is more intensive in the first descendant customization options are currently very limited and cannot be obtained without paying the lack of player trading means you must either grind for hours or buy items from the expensive in game shop player trading in warframe makes the grind more bearable verdict overall the first descendant has a lot of potential as a mix of the two most popular looter shooters warframe and destiny the gameplay loop is fun and the graphics are decent however they need to tone down the microtransactions reduce the grind and introduce more free customization options
