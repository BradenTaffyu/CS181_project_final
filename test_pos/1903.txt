basically once human is like a mash up of state of decay fallout 76 and the division with some secret world influence the game has its issues and a bit janky but it s just so much fun filled with a lot of content you ve got main quests to follow side quests that you can find in settlements and the open world as well as side activities and public events main quests are fully voice acted but side quests are mostly not combat is a bit too easy so far but i haven t progressed that much compared to others enemy varieties are at least very robust you ll always find new enemies as you progress through the map and story progression is very natural and the game doesn t give you new gear at every opportunity so each upgrade feels substantial besides combat you also progress in the survival aspect to unlock more recipes and building materials the game is very very generous for f2p lots of stuff that could ve been paywalled are totally free in this most of the stuff from gears to building materials are free and unlockable via your skilltree inventory limit is very generous and you can build as many storages as you wanted to you can change appearance for free with a mirror you can buy your item of choice directly instead of rng with gacha there s no premium perk or anything affecting gameplay etc most of the negative reviews came from character creation limitations at launch like people couldn t delete theirs and move to another server leave negative review and left the devs fixed it quite swiftly but the damage is already done there are also a lot of confusions about the seasons even though not everything will be wiped the devs posted a faq on it to explained it better since lots of stuff can be carried over to the new season including gears mats cosmetic and many others reviews are moving to positive side nowadays
