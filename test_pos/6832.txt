2015 no spoiler in this review the latest episode in call of duty franchise continuing the story from waw bo1 and bo2 the time is setting in the future 2065 all the sci fi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality generally the main menu is fabulous you may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds and you can locally play with friends in split screen support both vertical or horizontal split this is very cool if you want to play together locally the game breaks into 3 big modes campaign multiplayer and zombies in bo3 all these modes are quite decent individually moreover all 3 modes are well connected such as in multiplayer mode you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in campaign mode most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes and in each mode you have your own progress they all have levels achievements and statistics separately besides all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends campaign and zombies mode both support coop up to 4 players another awesome part is the customizations and the media community most of the fps game such as battlefield series allow players to decorate their guns with camo and also have custom emblems for creative players to show themselves in bo3 each custom emblem support up to 64 layers which means you could create almost anything you want furthermore you may also fully customize your weapons with camo and paint job even clan tag or kill counter if you got prestige these customizations are not only for you to please yourself you can upload your sick guns the to in game media community all the bo3 players could see your works and rate them even download them if they like it so the customization and social functionality is quite robust in bo3 screenshots sharing coming soon in order to clearly express my opinion i will review bo3 mode by mode campaignvery nice and deep story continue the story from bo2 the story is so deep imo that you may have to play over and over again to truly understand the true story behind the scenes and there is a secret mode the secret almost everyone knew lol called nightmare after you beat the campaign mode basically the nightmare mode is not only the zombie version of the campaign but also re tell the story form a different aspect you should also try it if you want to understand the true story very nice and deep story support coop in all stages in campaign up to 4 players multiple routes on the map you may choose which route i g up from roof or side flank etc you are going to assault 4 diffculties provide different challenge for both newbie and skilled players lots of checkpoints no need to restart from the beginning when you die the cutscenes are nice and immersive playing campaign just like watching a movie awesome and beautiful scenes not only the sci fi stuffs you may also see some fantastic imaginary scenes in campaign secret mode nightmare totally different feelings and different order to tell the story from different aspect with different challenge story is so deep maybe not easy for everyone to see the true story in first run so many people think the story sucks pok if you still cannot understand the story here s a discussion by from chinese forum baidu tieba explains the whole story very well sorry it s written in chinese decent features success from the predecessor and add more new stuffs in bo3 the class weapon attachement perks wildcards and scorestreaks system are quite similar with bo2 the specialists and the new

each of them have 1 special weapon and 1 special ability for player to choose and specialists all have lots of outfits and taunts to unlock further showing off yourself tons of challenges achievements specialists weapons attachements perks camo calling cards for you to unlock statistics are informative lobby leaderboard is nice if you want to see how s the players in your lobby and yes you can chat in lobby right now can t chat in lobby in bo2 nuketown is back better connection in my opinion i ve played over hundred hours never get disconnected from server bo2 in bo3 players in asia is fewer than north america some modes are few players playing i m in se asia you can only see other player s level and shared showcase paint jobs variants and emblems no statistics even no history match replay friend list are still bugged in bo3 just like bo2 if you have over 100 steam friends it will only display random 100 friends in bo3 s friend listzombiesi played zombies mode less because it s not easy to find public game or other teammates to play together in asia sometimes the game connect me to europe server and my ping will over 300ms hard to play lol thus the following review might not very accurate and not very completed the map is quite big many place to explore very challenging it s not really easy to beat the game transform into the beast get special abilities and access certain places new stuff gobblegum you can get these gum for different boostsi can t tell much since i play few zombies mode but it s really fun to play zombies mode with friends in conclusion black ops 3 is quite a masterpiece in my opinion although there s some performance issue at launch treyarch quickly patch it in several hours the performance is quite nice and smooth now if you like cod series if you like sci fi and if you like fast pace fps you should try call of duty black ops 3 it s awesome
