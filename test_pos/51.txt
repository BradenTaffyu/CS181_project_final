whole presentation gorgeous the gameplay sound all i ever wanted is a fun game free from modern nonsense and their so called live services those high above don t like this i understand that and they send ign and those knuckleheads to threaten it and obey i understand that too but what i don t understand is where are they now a perfect blend of genres and ideas creates an unforgettable experience and even with some technical and narrative hiccups mostly chapter 6 this is an exhilarating journey from start to finish and should not be missed
