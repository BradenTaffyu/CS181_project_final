zombies genuinely carries this game completely every other aspect is terrible the campaign is awful and it solidified that call of duty no longer cared to tell interesting stories like in that great stretch of 2007 2012 releases the multiplayer is broken and unsafe but the zombies is one of the best co operative experiences ever it s great by yourself as well if this game ever goes for a really low price a long with the zombie dlc s it is worth it to buy there s also free community maps that are a gold mine of entertainment if zombies doesn t interest you don t touch this game but this isn t a review of black ops 3 it s a review of the best zombies experience ever
