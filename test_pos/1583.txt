2022 edit patch 2 0 hey immortal empires is out and guess what you can buy the video game now without a giant pile of caveats finally it s time to stop playing as uh kislev and time to start playing as all the factions you already liked playing in ii it s a solid foundation with a lot of cool varied factions but the realms of chaos campaign gets old really fast and there are some technical issues that need to be fixed i ve definitely had some fun with tw wh3 but it s gonna be a much better game in a couple months when the combined map campaign arrives if you have game pass it s worth looking at there otherwise i d advise waiting for a sale and a couple patches once immortal empires drops it s going to absolutely be worth it but if you haven t gotten this already you re fine waiting for a bit
