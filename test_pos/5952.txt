2019 i can easily put this game in my top 10 of all time since the 90 s that s how fun it is to play and spend time on but there are certain issues that seems to have been around from the beginning and have never been solved which makes it frustrating to play connection issues disconnects happen not usually but they do happen long queue time to play killer for me at least 15 minutes no solution for players rage quitting which happens often this is not a game that is balanced like cs go so prepare to have some moments that make you think boy how op can this character be developers keep making cosmetics and new characters while the issues that the game has had for a very long time are never addressedi have a love and hate relationship with dbd but it s mostly love update i do not recommend this game anymore if your goal is to play killer then this game is for you but if you plan to play survivor you will be frustrated the developers keep buffing killers with every update while nerfing survivors all in all if you like playing survivor do not get into this game
