a contender for greatest game of all timethis review is from the perspective of someone who 100 s games on steam graphics art direction you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dosnote while things like texture quality etc aren t the best in the industry the art direction here is seriously something else gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don tnote the sheer amount of different builds you can make here is outstanding the enemy and boss roster is also one of the most impressive i have ever seen variety does fall off late game however audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deafnote nothing crazy here audio design wise but the soundtrack is a bob audience kids teens adults grandmanothing to note pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computernote while you don t need a crazy build to run this game it does have some stuttering problems that persist no matter your build game size floppy disk old fashioned workable big will eat 10 of your 1tb hard drive you will want an entire hard drive to hold it you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the datanote nothing to note difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark soulsnote it is a soulslike enough said actually i will say its probably the easiest soulslike if you take advantage of everything the game has to offer grind nothing to grind only if u care to isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grindingnote there is only really a grind if you really need more levels or want to level everything up story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your lifenote a bit less cryptic then games like dark souls and there is a lot here if you dig in can be a bit hard to find though if you don t like reading item descriptions and piecing things together game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyondnote took me 115 hours to beat everything my first time price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your moneynote the amount of content and replayability is worth it even not on sale i have bought this game twice that s how good it is bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugsnote nothing major could consider some performance issues bugs though maybe completion experience you have to fight all major bosses get all endings and find most major weapons this requires at least 3 playthrus although i will say that you can breeze through the game pretty quick on ng could take anywhere from 50 100 hours depending on skill and how much optional content you do no grinding though 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10final thoughtsit is an all time great seriously p s feel free to friend request me on steam if you want to keep up on my completionist journey
