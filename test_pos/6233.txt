2016 product received for free the atmosphere of the game is really good i easily get thrilled when i m alone fixing the generator because i don t have other teammate to be a bait xd also the killer can see all the generators you are repairing when you explode it so you should becareful on the meter it will notify the killer also repair meter will decrease it s hard to survive when you are the last survivor left but there is a chance you can survive if you are using a good perk so you can juke the killer except for the professional killers who knows your moves and also uses a good perk you can also escape in the hidden hatchet even thou you didn t finish fixing all the generator but you need atleast to fix 2 generator so it will open i never tried being a killer in this game because no one joins my lobby due to internet sucks so i usually play as a survivor even thou you play as a survivor you get lag because you enter a random lobby sometimes the game is lag sometimes it s smooth it would be better if you play with your friends creating your own lobby since in alpha version there are still same bugs i still encounter in game hope they fixs the problems in this game
