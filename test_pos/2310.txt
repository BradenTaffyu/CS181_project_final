2020 a fresh start to the battle royale genre tl dr if you are considering trying out this game i highly recommend it it s very fun and offers a completely new style of battle royale apex legends remains by far one of the most solid shooter games i have experienced and i am extremely happy to see it land on steam to be given the opportunity to play it without all the recurring issues caused by origin this game combines aim skill split decision making movement and communication delivering it all in one package characters the character selection is amazing and allows players to choose which legend they want with each legend comes specific abilities and skills that differ from many other battle royale games and adds depth to the gameplay every character also has their own backstory based on titanfall lore and you will often hear references when they engage in dialogues movement this game has incredible capability in terms of movement the complicated and meticulous movement based system allows you to manipulate your character limitlessly to gain a competitive edge for example you are able to climb on top of virtually anything as well as slide which enables the potential for variety in each gunfight not to mention the movement feels fluid allowing for more challenging and fast paced combat gunplay and mechanics the guns are very responsive when fired and never feel clunky in this game you ll find that there is a wide range of guns to choose from whether it be assault rifles smgs snipers shotguns or pistols along with the numerous weapon choices also come attachments which can be applied to improve factors such as recoil firing rate magazine size etc the option for readily available customization to weapons adds incredible potential and power on the battlefield apex legends also has mechanics which are exclusive to it such as evolving shields moreover it introduces a ping system which allows users to communicate in all sorts of ways from each person s perspective making it easier to cooperate as a team updates and content the game s updates remain consistent and always add new and exciting content through new limited time modes this includes legends weapons and new maps map changes new skins are also released which are specifically designed to appeal to the player base furthermore the gameplay also always remains stable and balanced as developers ensure any bugs or exploits before implementing changes in every patch tweaks are always made to the guns and legends sometimes drastically changing the way the game is played the latest updates are always posted after each patch and can be found on the official apex legends news website conclusion overall the developers at respawn entertainment are doing an excellent job with apex legends as it has proven to be consistently good and innovative throughout everything they ve released so far i am enjoying the game a lot and will continue to play it and am very excited to see what s coming next score 8 9 10was this review helpful if so please leave a rating and comment on what you think this is my first time writing a detailed review awards are greatly appreciated
