some short thoughts capcom s greediness and game s wonky perfomance aside devs really worked hard to make the game feel like first one but better and first was really fun as well story felt more like a soft reboot than a sequel which is a bit shame but all that silliness is still there which i love reminds me a bit of oblivion combat is amazing i m surprised how they managed to make even most basic sounding classes fun to play sword and shield yay climbing enemies and obstacles like walls and cliff sides should be standard mechanic in every rpg by now although for some reason climbing on walls was more restrictive in this game than in first pawns are better than ever they still talk a lot which some may find annoying but it is less than in first they feel helpful and i like seeing terrifying creations people have made if someone gifts your pawn rotten food that might mean something is wrong exploration feels great i just kept sidetracking all the time for every nook and cranny they made a great effort to reward you wherever you went in a world quests were story wise mostly fine quality did jump around a bit but nothing too bad i did like how open many of them felt game doesn t tell you every answer and show you where you need to go you need to use your own noggin a lot more which was a nice change of pace overall very unique and amazing rpg best one i have played in years and will definitely continue playing for a long time let s just hope capcom gives it every support it needs to fix the perfomance
