2017 grand theft auto v is the definition of a love hate relationship it s one of those games that would greatly benefit from a neutral recommendation this game does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong i ll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore tl dr at bottom general the attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning puddles are dynamic people comment on your car as you drive by cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking it s mad it s clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living breathing environment for los santos the game is gorgeous everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset impressive reflections and eye catching vibrant colors it s such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown grey colour palette luckily optimization allows gta v to run as smooth as butter i ve been running the game on a gtx 1060 6gb on ultra high settings and have been consistently getting a 60 70 fps with very few frame drops friends with lower end gpus have reported the same thing to me this game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience first person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game if anyone still plays those nearly the entire game can be played through in first person which offers an interesting and often times challenging perspective for races firefights and roaming the city single player the single player is and always has been an amazingly enjoyable experience it s a lovely blend of gritty twisted dark plotlines and absurd entertaining fun there are some scenes that were a bit too much for me the trevor torture scene still keeps me awake at night but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference the character dynamic between franklin micheal and trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing which could be a while it took me about 50 hours to finish the main story and 90 hours to 100 it however content is limited thanks to rockstars inability to hear the community s cry for solo content a lot of people wouldn t mind spending 10 20 on an expansion for the single player but rockstar continues to ignore half of it s game to continue to work on it s cash cow grand theft auto online gta online sings a tune very different from that of the single player online is at best a hugely entertaining passtime and at worst a horrible nightmare to play the game essentially revolves around completing missions jobs heists etc in order to acquire large sums of money you then use this money to buy vehicles weapons and property which often times unlocks new missions jobs and heists to play at your disposal the main problem with this model is that unless you re willing to grind your ass off you re not getting anything quick as more and more updates come out the prices of things go up and up all in a desperate attempt to push shark cards in game currency for real money what s even worse is that the value of shark cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that gta online has had over the years on launch 1 000 000 was an insane amount of money now it s chump change with every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything the most expensive shark card in the game 99 99 usd gives you 8 000 000 in game you will burn through that quick so unless you re ready to spend a lot of money to get everything you want you ll be grinding what adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money and all the bans that don t get applied you d be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby they run rampant with free rain to kill everyone and everything and spawn themselves and you money don t worry rockstar will just ban them right that d be nice most of the time they do ban waves they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money and will either take their money or ban them completely from online it s entirely innapropriate and rockstar really needs to work on it so say you ve acquired your money you ve bought some nice things and now you re enjoying free roam prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities i ve ever experienced this game breeds toxicity people will blow up you your car your plane and your will to live low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back as they don t have sticky bombs miniguns or any other of the strong anti grief weapons your only option after that is passive mode which is no fun whatsoever basically what i m getting at is online is a complete nightmare to play alone however if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together you re in for some of the most fun you ll ever have playing races and missions together away from public lobbies is the most entertaining thing i ve ever played the most recent update the doomsday heist reintroduced new pve content instead of the hollow pvp content they ve been pushing lately it s a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game and if they continue on the path of pve and co op i can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future i cannot stress it enough if you plan on getting this game for online get it with friends tl dr pros amazing single player experience extremely detailed world beautiful scenery and environments impressive optimizations stupid fun recent updates for online are a step in the right direction cons rest in peace single player content stupid hard push on shark cards one of the most toxic communities i ve ever seen hackers run rampant 24 7 grind to get anywherei want to be able to fully recommend this game 100 but i simply can t while i do fully recommend it if you plan on playing it with friends the downsides of playing online by yourself are staggering i repeat if you plan on playing the online play it with a couple of friends you will enjoy your experience exponentially more
