2023 sea of thieves is special because it s the first game that i have played where i had a truly entertaining story to tell my folks after each session i could deep dive in all the details that make this game perfect but i won t spoil it for you what i can tell you is that whatever you try to do in this gem of a game crazy stuff will happen to you sometimes funnysometimes challengingsometimes frighteningbut also heartwarmingyes it s a sandbox game and it will mostly be about what you make out of it but if you pour in enough hours to go through all the quests and stories it has to offer you will discover something magical in the end and that something is that sot is not exactly about plundering it s about building friendships defying the odds playing bold and experimenting it taught me to charge towards the unknown to try new things to take my time to stay composed through fire and flames to interact with strangers to lose and win gracefully and heck even to enjoy defeats with all this for the first time of my life i play a game because it feels good in a meaningful way it keeps on giving a year has now passed since i shared my first incredible tale with my family and recently my 7yo son finally asked to join me we now sail and live new adventures together every saturday morning i cherish these moments with all my heart as we bond together more than ever in sea of thieves all are equal and in these crazy days we live in as an increasingly divided society the community feels like a safe haven to me this game is a ray of sunshine to me and will probably be for many years to come thank you rare 3
