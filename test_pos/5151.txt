2019 to start this review im going to say that this game is not for everyone while i do think everyone should try this game out i am certain that there will be a lot of people who dont like this game so i ll go through pros and cons first then just like a paragraph of other info pros relatively cheap for the mileage you can get blast with friends whether your good or not great graphics active devs about 30 of the community is actually very nice a lot of operators to fit your playstyle even if it fluctuates like me plenty of maps to learn rewarding gameplaycons bugs and exploits can happen sometimes ubisoft servers are trash most of the time when an update comes out a decent amount of the community is toxic stressful and sometimes harmful gameplay very high skill ceiling ranked is very tense is sometimes a good thing casual is usually chill but sometimes people team kill or are dumb which can be annoying very hard to learn requires a huge amount of game senseconclusion i love this game personally and i started playing it right at the end of operation health which if you dont know was an entire season of the game taken to fix bugs glitches and exploits this game has evolved heavily over time from a mediacore csgo spin off to a very unique and fun fps with millions of players platform wide as with all character based games like overwatch and league siege has a tier list and everyone has a main i personally dont bother with the tier list on operators and i just play who i find fun or who i think will be great for the situation my mains fluctuate a lot you could have asked me my main last week and i would ve said yeah dude bandit main for life i inject heroin directly into my veins every day dude but this week it would be naw dude bandit echo main for life i love sitting in the objective jerking my but that s just me there are probably plenty of people with more stable mains so yeah this game has a lot of stuff good and bad personally i love it i would recommend it to people who are into these kinda games and if you buy it and love it or want someone to play with hit me up i have like 2 people i play it with and this game is so much more fun with friends
