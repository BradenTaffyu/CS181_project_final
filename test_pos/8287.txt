2019 in my opinion noita does a great job by having the essence of what going into a fresh roguelike feels like you re clueless and slowly go from there to being slightly less clueless then figure you ve actually missed a massive conceptual portion of the game and just played with the surface also every pixel being its own thing is cool it s like if cortex command was a good game on that aspect the mix match with spells and wands you can do is also great if you like nearly breaking the game also something something alchemy liquids are important
