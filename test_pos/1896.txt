i have a few hundred hours from the betas and the discord people know me as the person that has a lot of negative things to say about the game saying that the game is pretty fun if you arnt a rust player expecting rust its great its kinda like the division its kind of like rust with building and what not its got really cool looking monsters and progression feels fluid and fun if you like survival crafting collecting etc kind of games its not super hard core they have to go by chinese game laws which means no forced pvp pvp servers feel more engaging at least they did in beta accessing more of the map now may yield different results the big negatives you see are from people not reading before doing anything they created a character on any random server they miffed their character creation just to rush in and then realized they couldnt have a character on another server when they likely had a friend do the same thing and didnt coordinate with each other first it will be a while before we can make new characters idk why i think its dumb but its not worth review bombing over there are other reasons that i would think might be logical to write negative reviews but idk if they fixed a lot of that from beta dont let the mostly negative get you down its not pay to win its cosmetic only its got some bugs but its not terrible i feels good to play check it out try it for yourself its free
