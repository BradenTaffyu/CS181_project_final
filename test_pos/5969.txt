2016 product received for free note this game was gifted to me by someone affiliated with the developers what s even more fun than chopping people up with your homemade machete while they re stuck in your bear traps well chasing down your friends with a chainsaw while you re on teamspeak with them and screaming come here little piggy this game is heavily based on the old slasher movies there is one killer and four stupid teenage survivors the survivors goal is to fix all generators open one of the two exits or hidden trapdoor if you re last alive and escape the killer s goal is surprise killing all of these stupid kids and hanging them on hooks to offer them to his lord and savior satan aka the entity the kids can t defend themselves against the 7 foot tall maniac but they can use the environment to their advantage you can hide in lockers outlast throw piles of wood behind you to block the killer s path or stun him when he s right next to it when you throw it down and you can use the mist in combination with rocks trees etc to your advantage to hide behind aswell the only thing that s missing is a black guy because they are always supposed to die first in slasher flicks but oh well future dlc there is five different items that you can unlock as a survivor and these will help you win they are the med kit toolbox map flashlight and skeleton key the med kit lets you heal people faster while the toolbox makes you fix generators quicker or can let you destroy hooks to ruin the killer s day the flashlight can be used as a flashbang towards the killer by shining into his eyes for 1 or 2 seconds he will be temporarily blinded and anyone who he might be carrying on his shoulder will be dropped and then there s the map in my opinion the most useless item in the game because it shows you what generators have been previously used by highlighting them through the walls for a short amount of time if you have add ons for it i ll get to those in a bit then you could also see the killer s aura aswell as the exit locations and then finally there is the mysterious skeleton key not much is known about this yet i ve played for about 40 hours at the moment of writing but i haven t gotten one of these yet i have got add ons for it however apparently the skeleton key lets you unlock the hidden trapdoor on the map after only 2 generators have been fixed already while normally it will only open when you re last alive and then you and all your friends can just jump through it for an insta win don t take my word for that though besides items there is a lot more to leveling and progression all four survivors and all three killers have their own progression tree which can further developed with bloodpoint which are gained from finishing public games every survivor and every killer has his her own unique perks and progression tree you can keep progressing until you re level 50 and then you can go prestige which will reset you back to level 1 and gives you a random bloodied cosmetic item for that character all your perks and items get taken but you ll keep your 4 perk slots besides the leveling system there is also a ranking system for public games you start at rank 20 and you can work yourself up all the way to rank 1 survivors and killers each have their own online rank but unlike the levels which are tied to each different character your rank is only tied to a category either survivors or killers if you get enough points you will receive a crystal or even two if you manage to get the max amount of points as soon as you collect 3 of these crystals you will rank up at some point you ll need more than 3 and this amount keeps increasing the higher you get if you don t get enough points in a match you will lose a crystal and when you re back to 0 crystals you ll lose your rank again right now there s not really a purpose for these ranks besides showing others how brave and pro you are you don t get matched with the same ranks and there s no unlocks or whatsoever besides a colored number showing above your head also you cannot earn bloodpoints or rank up in private games all of this requires you to play with random people we already talked about items but there s a lot more to your loadout so let s talk some more about add ons perks and offerings shall we there is add ons which are additional smaller items which you can attach to your main item to make it better such as adding more charges to your med kit or being able to use the flashlight for a longer duration of time then there s offerings offerings can only be used once at the start of the match to get a one time advantage over the killer such as all four survivors starting together or receiving 50 more bloodpoints for the duration of that game and finally there s perks each character has its own unique perks that help them in the game linked to their personality and profession dwight is the leader and so if you stay close to him you will repair the generators quicker meg is the silent cat girl who is quicker and more silent than the others claudette is the botany trained healer who is better at healing others and jack is the traps expert who can easily take care of and destroy traps quickly now that we ve talked about the survivors let s talk about the killers there is three different killers each with their own unique weapon and skill the trapper can place down bear traps around the map that you can get stuck in and make you an easy pray for him the wraith can go nearly invisible as he pleases and suddenly pop up behind you to scare you like crazy and the hillbilly has a chainsaw that he can rev up to go into a crazed murdering state and come chasing after you while he holds his chainsaw above his head oh yeah and that also instantly downs you if it hits you i wonder what killer is going to be added next i can t wait to chase people with a big crazed evil clown with a sledgehammer also real slashers like jason voorhees or michael meyers might be cool to see in their respective areas but i m not sure if they can get the rights for that it also seems as if there has been made an area for each different killer there are 3 different areas each with 4 different maps there is the car junkyard linked to the trapper the abandoned coal factory with a broken bell tower linked to the wraith and the old farm full of the fantastic cornfields and more linked to the hillbilly all with all it s a really fun game both to play with strangers aswell as to play with friends which i recommend the most there is currently still some missing features however like being able to play with your friends in public games or some kind of chat for public games but it s a really unique game with a lot of potential the developers are promising a new update atleast once every week so can t wait to see what s in store for us i love unique games and i love horror movies so this game is just perfect for me it s both fun to play as a survivor aswell as the killer things that can be improved or should be added you cannot play in a public game with your friends and there s no bloodpoints to be earned in private games there is not a single kind of chat mechanic no text chat voice chat or even quick chat so you can t tell your fellow survivors that they can take you off the hook cause the killer is not camping you talking about that hookcamping really ruins the fun several bugs that break the game such as being stuck on the killer s shoulders until one of you leaves more rewards for the ranking system aswell as balancing it so that you can rank up more easily preventions for leaving the game early and you losing crystals for that a larger variety of maps abandoned carnival huge manor a village or snow mountains sound like cool ideas voice acting for the killers
