2017 this is my 600 hour review i ll break this down between single player and online because i have different opinions on both first is single player because its easy single player is a near perfect masterpiece probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time if you are looking into this game for sp then its a no brainer however next we have gta online its a mixed review i have a lot of hours into online and i will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online pros it gets constant content added several times a year the release free dlc sthere really is a lot to do if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent cons i ll just start out with the biggest con the game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro transactions its pretty obvious the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game compared to the amount of money you earn unless you are dedicating your life to this game its pretty hard to obtain the in game items and if you are starting out as a new player the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle i am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions but these aren t even fair micro transactions rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items but the amount of money given out on a shark card has never been adjusted here is an example a 8 million dollar shark card unless on sale costs 99 always has it use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around 2 million so for 99 you could typically buy say 5 15 items for 99 fast forward to today most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6 5 million rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren t even attempting to hide it not to mention that the latest dlc the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones so higher prices to buy stuff lower income from doing work so you are forced to not really play the new dlc but the old ones for cash which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun they just dont pay well so if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices 1 buy shark cards and alot of them several hundred dollars worth 2 play an insane amount of hours quit life and play this game every day all day long 3 cheat find mods or a modder and get modded money warning you can actually get banned for this i cant even beleive i am giving this advice out i use to depise money modders but given the greed coming out of rockstar now days i really understand why new players would do it and i dont frankly care anymore so you might ask why do i have this game as recommmened still when it comes down to the game itself single player and even online it s fun there is a lot of varitey i can do missions i can race cars i can pvp i can play mini games and there are dozens of varietys of games i ve played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1 2 the things you can do there is a massive amount of content the game is fun the politics behind the scenes is horrible the comminity is toxic and the micro tranactions are getting out of control but at the core its still fun and i still enjoy it after all this time but on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions so there is that factor too i rate gta 5single player gameplay 10 10online gameplay 8 10 2 for community variety of things to do 10 10game updates 8 10microtranactions 0 10
