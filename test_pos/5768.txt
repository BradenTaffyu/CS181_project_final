2019 playtime does not reflect my total bads most toxic people online period i joined a casual match one morning and the first thing i heard before i even loaded was i wish i was george zimmerman so that i could ve you get the idea don t you dare tell me that league of legends is worse don t tell me csgo is worse dude if you re in a game with spanish people they just say puta puta puta puta i could make a dance mix like the badger song i think rocket league has a higher percentage of people who are toxic in that game almost everyone ruins the game in a temper tantrum if it starts going bad but in r6 the toxic players are outright cruel in ways that the people on rocket league are not in one there are kids having fits in the other there are mature adults thinking carefully about exactly how to give you nightmares and kids imitating them it can be pretty upsetting at times the ranked system has all the flaws of current games of the era you ll never go pro it s the typical closed league system where unless you re rich or famous you re just plain not going to be recruited no matter your skill and good luck showing your skills i wrote something on reddit which got threadlocked instantly cranky much about how the current elo system is completely broken for games which only score you based on win loss in teams you re forcefully paired with but r6 doesn t even use elo which has mitigations in place to make it possible for people with an unfairly low rank to get higher it s just solely you win you got points you lose you lost points which sounds like it makes sense until you consider the edge cases and variables involved for example one problem with these systems is that they don t score based on activity in any way meaning that people who play infrequently but play in games they somehow know they re going to win have a higher rating than people who play every day there s an incentive with this kind of ranking system to hoard your rank like dragon s gold and what if you consistently perform better than everyone else on your team but your rank still goes down because you re not an actual god yet and they lose it for you nobody wants to talk about these issues not gamers not designers it s kind of pathetic how afraid everyone is of questioning tradition lastly the patches for the game come pretty slow ubisoft will have designed launched made dlc for and end of lifed several games by the time they finish making a system for r6 that simply makes pieces of cardboard break the same way on everyone s screens i can come up with the math for this in my head a gussied up adaptation of minecraft s brick breaking netcode would work fine for example so i don t know why they ve delayed it over and over again it s important because you need to have it guaranteed that everyone has the same viewholes and the same blocked views or people will be able to take advantage of stuff being different on their screen versus everyone else s right now the feature has been pushed back to we ll start thinking about how we want to try doing this in january as of the latest patch notes what yeah goods regardless of how accurate it is or isn t siege does a good job of making things feel like they could be real pick your favorite swat action movie where the team bursts into a room with the lasers on their guns pointing in all different directions you get to live that if you ever had any interest in knowing what it feels like r6 does that procedural action thriller feeling perfectly rescue hostages disarm the bomb secure the biohazard container i think the hostage rescue is the best and most exciting but most people don t because crazy leroy can kill the hostage by accident pout still you get to do all that stuff it s great the only thing it s lacking is mirrors to show you what s around the corner like in a stallone flick which you can sorta do with the camera drones anyway so it sort of has that fixes might come with all the slowness of water eroding the grand canyon but the actual content drops are fun interesting and come at blink and you ll miss it speed there s always new things to try like deployable shields with little bits of glass you can use to peek through them or the new pick ban mode where you and the other team collaborate compete on who you can play as in a match or the rainbow is magic event where all the operators are wearing pink clothes and fight with confetti as blood in an airplane designed to look like a baby nursery complete with voiceovers that sound like they re read out of a storybook new operators with new abilities every three months guaranteed are also a big plus don t like the current set of play options wait a little bit and you ll get to try something new don t feel like you can handle twitch shooting a recent new operator has laser cameras that let you camp out and track enemies safely from your little hidey hole and annoy them with laser barrages it s useful to everyone else to know where the enemies are especially if you can shave some of their hp off so it s not a second class choice by any measure another recent one lets you cover the floors in spikes that literally fill entire rooms changing the tactical dynamics completely wish the game was stealthier the current update brings an attacker who can barely be heard and jams cameras so they can t be seen choice choice and more choice back in the day games like bf3 and bf4 and even call of duty gave you a lot of guns very quickly and let you pick between all of them change what color they are change the way their scope looks change whether they had a grip or not and so on basically nothing lets you do this anymore it takes a lot longer to grind for attachments and weapons and there s an obvious linear progression of weapons in most games where you simply get a better weapon the longer you play i feel like some ceo s kid had trouble with all of those choices and cried and they said ok son no more weapon choices in games daddy loves you yeah well in r6 that kid is f ed there s a lot of variety some of it is hidden away in individual operators but you re likely to find a loadout you enjoy the community what you said the community was toxic yes but the people who aren t toxic are great the community is filled with geniuses who share their analyses on tactics that you might not have considered using before r6 s mechanics are very open ended for example you can shoot through floors or ceilings and excavate a giant view to the level of the building above or below you there s strategies on when and where to try stuff and people advise each other on near infinite amounts of situations spend a few hours looking at the siege academy subreddit and you ll probably learn a lot if you re new below lv100 or so conclusion all in all i think the people who love this game love options if you like being able to do anything choose anything r6 stands alone in 2019 as one of the only big name games that cares more about offering choices than whether or not it feels fair and it is mostly fair it just might seem unfair at first i got into a pretty long talk with a hacker a few days ago who said they hated the game because people could peek at them guess where they were based on foot noises and other cheats that are actually coded into the game intentionally whiny little snots who ve never experienced true freedom in a game will hate this i hope they stick with it and learn how everything used to be before the f ing idiocracy won and making things accessible and unthreatening became more important than making them interesting and educational r6 out of all the big aaa games is the least safe watered down and predictable i can think of just please forgive my potato aim
