2022 i have 59 hours in this game and i think i m still 5 10 hours from beating it lol good one it took me about 80 hours to beat my first play through and then i kept playing i found two new areas after i had beaten the final boss i have done nothing since 4pm on thursday february 24th but wake up play this game and go to sleep if you are concerned about not liking open worlds but you like fromsoft games just give elden ring a chance i swear it will be worth it most open world games for the last decade are full of nothing they look nice but have next to zero substance elden ring s open world is comparable to breath of the wild and no game in since botw s release has made me feel the way botw did every way is the right way there is insane new stuff around every corner you ll think you have dementia because every 20 minutes you ll find some insane new thing and forget what you were actually trying to do beforehand it s not a graphical marvel but fromsoft has never had the chance to apply their style to a fully realized world and the lands between are jaw dropping at times and always stunning regardless of your location while at its core its still soulsborne it s hard to compare to the rest of the series because of how much of a difference the open world makes elden ring was worth the wait and is easily one of my favorite games of all time this game is worth full price and always will be and you should support fromsoftware and buy this game at 60 if you can afford to do so hopefully they will be making memorable and creative games for the forseeable future if you are worried about the pc performance issues many people have complained about here is my input on them i have a 2070 super 32gb of ram and an amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core processor 3 59 ghz it only occasionally every 15 30 minutes maybe stutters when i m in a large open area or when there are lots of particle effects on screen it s not unplayable it is a second or two of reduced framerate it has never gotten me killed or made the difference between life or death in 60 hours it is locked at 60fps which is not a problem to me and it shouldn t be to you either like i said fromsoft games have never been graphical innovators the difference between 60 and 120 frames is negligible and fromsoft has made it clear they re working to optimize it as much as possible there has been noticeable improvement from day 1 even you could probably run this game just fine with a 1070 as the recommended specs suggest it s not unplayable unless you re a complete snob in which case i suggest you remove the graphics card from your rear end
