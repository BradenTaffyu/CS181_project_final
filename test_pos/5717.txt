2016 as of today i have just purchased the starter edition for around 15 i have just gave it a test run and let me just say the gameplay was amazing the two free operators randomly picked were dull in my eyes and i haven t even tried them however using the provided 600 rainbow six credits or something i bought thermite and that gs9 character with electrical charges forgot the name so i ll just call him sparky these two characters represented my play style so perfectly i chose to use them for the whole game the loading time to find players in casual tdm was quite minimal taking about 20 seconds the matchmaking paired me up with the nicest pair of guys who helped guide me through everything congratulating me upon my first kill and what came next this definitely left a amazing impression on me as i look forward to bring countless hours to this game to me the 15 was totally worth the price as i m not to impatient with the excessive grinding that is needed to unlock further operators to all those who are patient buy this game quickly for 15 when you have the chance i think it ends june 19th otherwise go for the 40 if you so desperately desire all operators so quickly i ve heard this game is dying so it might benefit to put only 15 in it because honestly a multiplayer game can only be worth 15 to me as a side to the main campaign so that being said rainbow six siege is worth that 15
