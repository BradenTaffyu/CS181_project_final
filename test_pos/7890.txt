2020 while i don t have many hours on the steam version yet i have over 2 000 hours in this game since release it has had it s ups and downs with a very rocky launch but rare has shown nothing but love and passion for this game since the start and has consistently added quality content and updates since release the changes that have come since the start have just brought out more to love about this game while it is a sandbox and there is no true end game it s all about the stories you build and adventures you go on with friends or randoms they have built an amazing world for great gaming moments be it as simple as finding treasure with a friend to fighting a meg the kraken and a skele ship all at the same time while the game won t be for everyone i highly recommend giving it a shot hop on the discord and you ll be sure to find some friendly pirates to sail with if you are solo see you on the seas my friends
