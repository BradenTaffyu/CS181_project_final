2017 alright so lets dive into a good review of this game for both killers and survivors ill start by talking about a few of the must knows about this game for survivors because this will likey be your frist choice when playing the game a few of the things we will talk about here is the things i love about the game vs the things i dont like about the game starting with what i like about the game great variety for survivor choiceslevel system is very fluidgame play is auxiliaratinggreat variety so to explain what i mean about the variety of survivors you can pick from is without dlc you have a choice of seven different characters each having its own skill set which actually makes a difference to elaborate a little more about the skills each of the characters have three skills that are unique to the survivor some of them make a difference as far as escaping the killer to healing team mates and so far and so forth level system is very fluid omg i cant tell you how happy i am about the leveling system over time you gain blood points for doing actions in the game from either repairing generators to helping team mates off the hook basically the things you do in game matter i cant tell you how happy that makes me i see games that reward a base xp on just the groups ability instead of individual ability but back on topic the blood points you can spend in the bloodweb that has different items like flashlights toolkits medkits keys maps and attachments for each of those items which can help you in the fog which is where the game is played game play is auxilirating the game keeps you on your toes with killer perks that make you constantly be watching your back the killer is a different story although i can say i have never played a game where it keeps me wondering where the inpending doom is coming from what are my escape routes where are my team mates being chased makes you actually fear being hit from maps that have corn fields classic hollywood feel and the unique killers make it even better although some of the cool ones like michel myers and freddy are dlc locked but there are still some cool free ones now for what i dont like and dont worry ill try and be fair but keep this short enough so lets go face camping killersteam mates not working togetherkiller perks make it harder sometimesnow notice this list is short because for a survivor the only thing you have to worry about is the generators and the killer although killer perks and team mates not working together can sometimes make for an interesting game that can either lead to you escaping by the skin of your teeth or being killed off because team mates didnt work together there are many videos out there that help new players and ill leave a link to a channel that i watched to gain new insight that would other wise take a new player tons of hours to learn face camping killers what i mean by this is when you get downed by the killer he she has to take you to the hook where the entity will try to steal your soul and all that good stuff well you have three times to be hooked first one you dangel there until you reach phase two or get freed if you hit phase two you have to struggle to stay alive as the entity tries to kill you phase three you die instantly so you can see the problem some killers will camp survivors who have been hooked until they reach phase two making the next down a guaranteed kill against a survivor team mates not working together and killer perks making it harder this is a great challange for any player experienced or not when team mates refuse to work on generators and waste time it makes the game harder plus the killer perks which make generator repair speed slower or even some other ones that will be mentioned in videos on the channel i linked make the game near impossible sometimes to win yet ive managed to escape through the hatch which spawns as the last person in the game when all team mates are dead a second escape is optional killers tend to go to the hatch and camp it to keep you from leaving this way and then you have to decide to risk the escape or repair generators to open the gates killers have there own issues like being pallet looped and flashlight stunned and that can lead to face camping and other things and i could go on and on about how great this game is and the flaws i can find in it but overall i cant think of a game that has me egar to play and scared for my life at the same time channel link my personal favorite youtuber for helpful tips and guides niva1a niva1a s channel link although if i had to rate this game on any sort of scale it would look like this on a point scale of 1 10 1 being bad 10 being great aspect points survivor killer gameplay 8 5 rewarding feeling 9 overall fun level 9 5
