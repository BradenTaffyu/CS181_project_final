2020 i have always been a huge fan of the rogue like genre so noita seemed like a for sure purchase after 100 hours it still feels like i m only beginning to scratch the surface of this extremely unique and beautifully animated game there are endless possibilities for perks wand combinations which keeps you pressing new game when that long run comes to a swift and painful ending the alchemy and fact that every single pixel has its own properties adds yet another layer of depth that ive never seen in another rogue like game all that being said noita is hard and there is something to be learned from every death the entire world is full of surprises that i wont spoil but if you re the type of person who finds themselves saying just one more run while playing other games you wont be disappointed here
