2018 player s singleplayer x multiplayer open worldmost missions can be played with up to 3 other players online there are singleplayer sections as well as some open world areas but most of the game is for 1 4 players story has no story not interesting important decent story x good story emotional rollercoasterthe game starts out with hardly any story but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details after that you have a pretty good story in many aspects long term motivation play time very short 100h so many different things to do and farm you can spend thousands of hours if you want todifficulty very easy x doable for everybody might be somehow challenging very hard dark souls hardnot that challenging you just need to dedicate timecontrols few buttons x average amount of buttons might need some time to get used to wait which button again besides your movement keys you just have to shoot and use 4 abilities you need to memorize everything to be fast but it s nothing particularly difficult time investment grind relies purely on skill need to invest some time but skill will help a lot of grinding x lock yourself up in the basementyou better get ready for some long a grindingdiversity same thing over and over again x sometimes a little monotonous a lot of different levels surprise motherf er you have a lot of different planets and random generated maps for every mission but the basic gameplay stays the same characters customization none few possible changes a lot of ways to upgrade your character x essential for the gamebasically everything you do comes down to leveling designing modifying your character graphics complete garbage very bad okay looks nice sometimes x good graphics but nothing special visually stunningmusic soundtrack none my ears are bleeding i ll just listen to my own music x can be quite nice absolutely beautifuldefinitely hase some good soundtrack that is worth listening toatmosphere yeah looks good x stunningthe game creates a very good atmosphere especially due to its variety of planets and locations you really feel like you are part of that universe well you actually are and many places like the moon called lua in game or the void look just super gorgeous in game purchases pay 2 win x pay 2 skip everything can be acquired by just playing the game no real money can be spendyou can spend soooo much money but at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game as i said before this game has a lot of grinding which can be skipped by paying but it s not p2w personal thoughts this game is definitely not for everybody if you don t like spending a lot of time grinding and doing some things multiple times this game is nothing for you but if you do like those things this game is excellent especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons warframes companions planets gamemodes if you re not sure whether to get it or not just try it out especially since it s free have fun edit 1 changed my view on the story and added a rating for controls edit 2 added rating for player s edit 3 added rating for music soundtrack and atmosphere
