2021 a friggin mazing i can t remember the last time i spent this much time on a video game this is a very fresh take on the battle royale feel sure the same concept of getting to the circle has been done but this combat the characters and abilities the character customizations truly i had no choice but to come on here and write about this because i need to do my part to make sure everyone gets this game it is a blast and although as frustrating as it can be learning that moment you master countering and dodging in the split second that it counts is so rewarding now i just need to find gaming friends to enjoy this with but shout out to all the work that went into this because this game is the best i ve never been so glad to have a nice computer to be able to play it on p s you should definitely try and look at some of the tutorials online to help you learn tips and tricks from beta it is actually extremely helpful that they give you a tutorial at the beginning but i m finding myself just looking at videos online to get better good luck
