the game is not perfect by any means it has bugs it has crashes it has a terrible policy for purchased cosmetics they are making them account wide in august instead of locked to a single character but it is still an incredibly fun experience with a dev team that cares a ton about the lifespan of the game this game manages to feel completely fresh in this genre without doing anything that changes the already functioning formula for mmorpgs playing with friends is enjoyable and the dungeon type content that is released so far is incredibly fun i have never enjoyed grinding dungeons for loot but this game made queuing up with 3 friends and running a dungeon 45 times indescribably fun if you re looking for a great free to play game that doesn t unfairly punish you for being a free to play player than this is my top choice a side note to the devs keep doing what you re doing the community absolutely respects your desire to make changes based on their feedback and your commitment to improve the game based on our current suggestions is proof that you re worthy of my time thanks for making this game
