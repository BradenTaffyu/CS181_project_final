2016 the community on this game is amazing shoots team mate team mate says sorry mate that was my fault my movements when i was first playing this game i joined a multiplayer lobby not thinking about how i was going to play both teams asked if i was new to the game after finding out i was new they both said don t kill penguin were going to teach him how to play one of the enemys team tried killing me after everyone said they were going to help me he got teamkilled and they continued teach me the ways and after a long session i think i was better at the game and most of them added me on uplay i thanked them all and now i feel i owe this game a good review for gameplay and community
