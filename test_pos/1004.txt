2022 a 9 5 or 9 8 but not a 10 for melet me get this out of the way first elden ring is amazing game of the year without contest and probably the most impactful game release of this entire decade the open world genre has been stagnant and formulaic to a fault with massive maps full of absolutely nothing of value even critically acclaimed entries in the genre like breath of the wild while excellent games still all fail in giving their open world much meaning other than scenery breadth of an ocean depth of a puddle that defines the open world genre today and elden ring has come along and stomped every competitor into their graves it is the pinnacle of design for an open world rpg and will be what we measure newcomers and previous efforts by it is also a culmination of everything dark souls since they first released demon s souls on the ps3 so long ago now every lesson they ve learned over the time from software have been releasing games in this style has been put to work making their magnum opus and it will be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to improve that said they also keep making the same mistakes and that will likely not ever change a 9 5 or a 9 8 for sure but it cannot be a 10 for me you re free to disagree or even troll the comments but i do have the achievement for all the achievements here i ve done nearly everything of value and substance and have combed the entirety of the game despite the fact i love it dearly and am still playing the game has some problems i take personal issue with so since you know the game is life changing and amazing as was already fairly obvious i will now talk about what i dislike poise has become what seems like a dirty word at from software since dark souls they ve gradually removed its effect and importance over the game releases to the point it feels like there s no reason even show it on your character sheet i can wear the heaviest armor in the game swing a colossal weapon and equip the one talisman that provides poise to the player it doesn t matter because startup frames for any weapon of any size and any weight will be interrupted constantly by any enemy at all even the smallest and weakest even the wild deer and sheep can interrupt you if they hit you during startup frames i m not asking for the ridiculous poise we had in dark souls where we chugged estus and spammed r1 in front of the endgame boss while donned in full havel s gear i just want it to have meaning why would you give us a wealth of amazing incantations that summon literal dragons and have anyone and everyone able to just smack me out of channeling it vigor is a more vital stat than ever before not only do the bosses ramp up in damage dealt to a ludicrous degree but weapon arts from special weapons and certain ashes of war from players can have astronomical numbers moonveil the peoples champion right now can two shot most players with the weapon art and all you need is int to pump the damage 40 vigor and preferably 58 is needed to stand a chance against lategame bosses because as you ll have seen from many complaints the bosses can kill you quickly in just two or three hits sometimes even with soft capped vigor it s not very fun and wasn t at all needed in prior entries to make the fights against bosses meaningful and difficult having to play near perfectly just to see a phase change or a second health bar or another boss immediately is not very fun call it old age but i did get the achievement for all the achievements bosses and enemies also have attacks with barely any if at all startup frames which will hit you instantly and cannot be prepared for or dodged without luck you re just going to take damage whenever they feel like it and you not to mention the true evil of all from software games where it s utterly embarrassing they can t manage to fix it ever input queues branching off the way bosses are designed a lot have overly cheap abilities or relentlessly quick attacks worse still the game has input reads did you think the boss was simply relentless no it was meant to end its combo string and take a moment to pause and let the fake stamina bar recharge instead you take a sip from your flask and it triggers and immediate combo from the enemy almost no matter when or what they are you can test how ridiculous the input reads are in this game at a fort in caelid there are two large lion enemies with blades on their arms that can t exit the doorway you can target them inside then turn to face the wall extending outside and cast spells into thin air into the wall every cast nearly they will do a large jump to the side to dodge the projectile not based on being targeted not based on the projectile being near just because you hit the button this actually makes the sorcery which summons blades from portals the best in the game for some time because enemies will dodge the input and forget the spell effect still hasn t happened it s a horrible system and an amateur level oversight from someone like from software all in all these are fairly nitpick problems and they can easily fix things by adjusting numbers be it in damage or turning off input reads and queues or giving poise meaning and an actual effect all numbers problems easily fixed with time if those issues got resolved then i d likely amend this review and give the game a 10 out of 10 but with all these mistakes from software should and does know better than to make it almost feels intentional when it feels intentional i can t help but feel it s personal which is baffling considering how amazing in every other respect this game is 9 5 or 9 8 but not a 10 sadly
