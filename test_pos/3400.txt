2018 when i hear the word sandbox this is what comes to mind for me there s so much to do party at night clubs fight off waves of cops race motorbikes go skydiving screw around at the pier amusement park or go full criminal and run from the cops through the high end hollywood neighborhoods the npc interaction is amazing if you steal a car from a tough guy there s a chance he ll pull you out of it and beat you up or even set a bounty on your head heck you can even ride up to streetwalkers in your muscle car and shell over 50 for sucky suck the game s pvp does not shine certain pvp gamemodes involving shooting each other can be fun but for the most part the open world pvp is pretty fruity there s a lot of modders and hackers who roam in flying cars and bikes and shoot rockets at you and there s not much you can do about it there s armored cars that will charge you and blow you up and you can t really shoot the drivers out you can enable passive mode to get around safely but that takes away your ability to shoot or even ride with friends so it s not very effective at the end of the day the game s so fun that getting blown up or harassed every once in a while isn t that big a deal you can always just start a lobby with friends plus most of their new content is free and at least just costs a lot of in game money to get started plus the graphics are pretty good
