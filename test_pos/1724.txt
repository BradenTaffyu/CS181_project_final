2022 great improvement to twh2 the new content races are all insanely unique and fun to play performance issues are unfortunate but i personally have not experienced any improvements to diplomacy are much needed and will be even more apparent with more mortal order races settlement battles are very improved and actually allow for some tactics but are a bit too frequent new campaign is amazing depending on what you are looking for if you are looking for the same power fantasy of completely painting the map with little resistance in twh2 then wait for immortal empires in a few months if you are looking for a campaign that actually has some inherent challenge unlike the vortex which you could completely ignore then ca has finally done it the campaign gives you a little room to breath and expand your borders between the events but will continue to put pressure on you throughout the campaign also nerfs overly aggressive expansion which is much needed as there was no reason not to wildly expand in previous games making the mid late game extremely easy and boring this also adds more reason to try diplomacy with neighbors instead of just rolling them over overall a great improvement for the series and an even bigger jump in quality than from twh1 2 very excited to see this game improve with further updates and content
