it s a looter shooter similar to games like destiny and warframe while i can t speak to warframe since i just could not get into that game i do know about destiny this game has something that destiny has never had good devs the devs of tfd actually listen to feedback and even ask for more feedback regarding loot balance fun etc the game just came out and hasn t had any of it s end game content added i ve heard it comes out in august if the devs keep listening and asking for feedback i think this game will become incomparable to a game like destiny i ve never even seen a game that fixes bugs and issues this quickly people have been complaining about the drop rates for a a week or two and the devs have already buffed the hard mode drop rates the devs go out of their way to listen to feedback and if that s not good enough for you in todays game market then i doubt you ll ever actually enjoy a game because devs that actually listen are very rare today oh and also the devs are taking a balancing stance that says buff the weak and don t nerf the strong in regards to weapons abilities and builds you know the exact opposite of what helldivers 2 did
