2022 the hate this game has received is both fair and unjustified the game did have some fundamental development problems that meant that aspects of the overall game that where altered to praise by the community lord hero skill trees and tech trees as one example were reverted back to how they were halfway through wh2 s life cycle in other aspects however the game was an improvement over wh2 even after multiple years of updates diplomacy graphics to name a few understand before buying this game that this game is already fun i will say however that the campaign objectives do not encourage traditional tw gameplay i e sandbox experience and empire building updates have meant that you can kind of ignore the objective until you are ready but its still not perfect if you are looking for a cool story driven rts tbs game this will do i would also suggest this game to anyone wanting to get into twwh as this game is only going to get better and better and there are many aspects of wh2 that makes it jarring to play now that i have the updated model sieges diplomacy and the overall map if you own wh1 2 and are wandering about getting 3 wait i would strongly suggest waiting until ie comes out if you know you know because i guarantee that there is a faction you love playing now and will miss like crazy in the current game for me its vampire counts and gs in conclusion i do not agree with the review hate this game has received even though i understand this game is not perfect particularly as a concluding chapter in a trilogy but this game is still fun i would rate it 7 10 in its current state with the possibility if ca meet their current roadmap deadlines to become possibly a 9 or 10 10
