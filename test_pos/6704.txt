2019 i recommend solely for zombies not much else needs to be said this is the best iteration of cod zombies edit since this review got some attention i ll elaborate further this version of zombies is the definitive version in my opinion and there are several key reasons for it blops 3 zombies is the last version that sticks to the core formula it takes the established formula from waw black ops 1 and black ops 2 refining it as much as it can this version really feels like the most refined classic zombies experience so far it may not be as purist as some of the other version thanks to the new perks and gobblegum but it is still very much the classic formula just with some newer elements the default map is a tad gimmicky for my taste and i much prefer the classic experiences like verruckt and bo1 s maps that being said bo3 on pc has steam workshop support so you can have any map that a modder can dream up you have old maps ported to bo3 in the zombies chronicles dlc any map you can dream up through steam workshop and an overall modern refinement of the classic zombies formula its an equation for addiction now there are some legitimate complaints i don t like that people have to buy the full game just to play zombies especially since the campaign and mp are less than stellar i ended up buying a key off of a trader on reddit for 7 it was a good deal another legitimate complaint is the huge imbalances created by the gobblegum system gobblegums range from so useless they re almost a hindrance to so overpowered that all challenge is gone they can completely ruin the intended difficulty curve that being said i just don t use them they re not required by any stretch and i ve even seen some workshop maps that don t even have the gum machines some maps require you to get to a certain wave before using gums unless you are hell bent on using gums this isn t an issue the optimization on this game isn t great either overall it isn t the best cod port but since it has aged a while the optimization may not be an issue for you its old enough at this point that it probably will run just fine on most machines the graphics hold up pretty well for its age but there are occasional sometimes more noticeable in modded maps issues with pop in and texture loading the campaign is frustrating to me it has several individual moments with awesome ideas or cool concepts but none of it ends up amounting to anything the whole campaign essentially ends up meaning nothing won t spoil anything there are quite a few neat ideas like walking through virtual recreations of memories but those same ideas have so many oversights that ruin it for example one section has you reliving one of the battles in ww2 it would have been a great opportunity for era appropriate weapons as a sort of level wide easter egg but no these ww2 soldiers were using future sh t weapons quite a few ideas fall flat and don t work despite the presence of some ideas with great potential speaking of guns the default gun selection in bo3 is uninspired these weapons feel like a designer took modern guns slapped the bare minimum amount of fuuuuuuuuture on them and sent them to production the upside here is that mods allow for custom weapons from other games and previous installments this allows for a great and renewed variety in gameplay modders have even started to make entirely new weapons to implement in the game new and ported npcs from other games are also making an appearance i played a map with the panzerhund from wolfenstein in it that was awesome and unexpected i ve also used an infinite warfare weapon pack where all the weapons had their proper alternative fire modes mp is also uninspired it feels like the devs took a look at titanfall and did the bare minimum to capture some of the magic of that game s movement system the only problem is that it barely works and feels out of place the weird hero abilities also don t feel like they fit its almost like they made the mp into call of overwatch instead of a unique title with its own identity the mp tries to smash the identity of half a dozen other better mp games into one it fails at carving out its own path tl drzombies mode is great its refined has mod support and lots of longevity thanks to it the mp and campaign lack any real identity and they suffer for it this game is only worth it for zombies so pick it up on deep sale
