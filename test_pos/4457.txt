2018 this f2p is actually beyond amazing i have never had this much fun in any games players are okay learning curve and scaling is well balanced the game rewards trying out different frames and weapons so you don t have mains during the whole game did i mention this games is free there is an currency called platinum but it can be easily obtained just play the game get some drops and sell some to get plat this time acually spend more time having fun and playing the game than playing the market like path of exile the gameplay is also incredibly fast paced don t do conclave though because cancerous pvp actually cancerous i think it s a meme in the community at this point the devs are also super active really listening to the community and updating their game with a bunch of new features like archwings new storylines and quest glinding frame fighters etc and they do this without crippling their playerbase with sh t dlcs take f cking notes bungie
