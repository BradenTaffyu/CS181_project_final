2018 in my opinion the game is fun it s repetitive but oh well the game is okay for one of its kind 2 things i dislike about this games are people can rage quit if they get unlucky some killer is really annoying like really really annoying lolone of the downside i see from this game is sometimes i feel like the killer is hacking like map hacking but thats happen once in a blue moon when its happened it s kinda make me furious xdps there is 1 time first time as wraith survivors are trashtalking to me after the game because of not letting them win and camping so my question is are we supposed to intentionally lose because if that the objective the game is then the game fail big time dude if you are out there reading this please dont be toxic in this community if some of people playing for fun accept it if they playing serious there s no big deal right there s always another game no point on being harsh and making killer lose every round overall the game nice 9 10buy it
