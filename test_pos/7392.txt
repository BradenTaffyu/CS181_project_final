first off the negatives that everyone know so far the game uses denuvo drms are bad drms are evil there are microtransactions that weren t called for there is no in game option to restart your save to which i answer drms are evil drms are bad the mtx are all optional none are needed not even the riftcrystal dd2 is no mobile game farming you can fast travel with in game items looted or purchased with gold you can change your appearance with in game items purchased with rift crystals that can be easily looted off monsters treasures and through online pawn sharing they have no right to exist in a single player game but thankfully their existence don t take away game content their existence don t make resources harder to find these exist for the silly people who love spending more money than they need to also you can reset your save file by using steam cloud s settings and deleting some local files the goodit s dragon s dogma the combat is what dragon s dogma managed to achieve ten years ago reactive rewarding satisfying chaotic in terms of action rpg it is and always will be one of my favorite systems so of course i ll be biased the gameplay feels a little more sluggish but this sacrifice ends up making the movements and interactions feel like they blend together a lot better stamina is still consumed outside of combats and unlimited in settlements health and damage work nearly the same way the difference is that whenever you take direct damage your maximum health decreases down to 20 limiting your amount of recoverable health this encourages players to do better to avoid the heal spams and to simulate grievous wounds that need tending at an inn or at camp won t be to the taste of everyone but i began to dig it exploration is slow can feel tedious but each journey is rewarding there is always that sigh of relief when you can finally return to town unload your loot stock up on supplies and equipment then you just go out there once again further than last time easier than last time because your stats increased because you became better at mastering the system it feels good you want to find sidequests listen to npcs ranting about speak to them discover rumors there isn t any marker telling you hey you can start a sidequest there some npcs will come to you some will never interacting with the world is rewarding pawns the ai controlled teammates feel overall smarter more active and reactive the personality system has been simplified for everyone s joy although this takes away the joy of finally having a pawn do whatever the heck you wanted them to do it will work for some it won t for others but to be fair in dd1 you could just forcefeed scrolls to your pawn until they decided that gathering items and hugging you during big battles is actually a terrible idea i really enjoy this game i am so so very happy to finally see it exist and so grateful i got to play it so here is my honest tl dr review keep an eye on the game if it s your jam but do wait for compatibility performance patches i may have a somewhat powerful computer i want more people than those with very good rigs to be able to enjoy it the game is so very satisfying and so carefully made with a reputation unfortunately tainted by the terrible horrendous habits of the modern gaming industry please give this game a chance when it gets more accessible
