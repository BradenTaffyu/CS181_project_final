all in all dragon s dogma 2 is an adventure of epic proportions but not without its flaws let me list what i enjoyed and what i did not let s start with the positive the character creator is insane without a doubt the best most detailed one out there that i ve ever seen i actually shamelessly re created myself given a choice i want my first playthrough of any game to truly be mine and in dd2 i could quite literally make that so the first few hours and the last were the most amazing your first fight against a cyclops griffin or dragon are simply unforgettable the build up in strength too is amazing to witness and well fleshed out i got my butt kicked in under five minutes by the first dragon i ran into but by mid game it was the other way around and felt very satisfying the exploration too at the beginning is amazing there s a lot to see and explore i thought i had looked at every nook and crannie but never did get the achievement for having found 50 caves i personally thought there were enough vocations to keep it interesting i fell in love with mystic spearhand and stuck with it all game through i had also mastered fighter warrior my dear amaterasu main pawn was a magician and sorcerer and had a blast terrorizing local wildlife bandits and monsters alike there were truly funny moments too like her handing me herbs after a grueling fight against a troll pleasantly going here you go master like we had just enjoyed some nice quiet lunch instead of a vicious fight the ending was truly momentous i went for the regular good ending first before attempting the true ending and all cussing aside it was truly worth it literally epic to not give away spoilers i ll leave it at that but let me just say when i read people had shed some tears i had rolled my eyes thinking it exaggerated until it happened to me too full marks what i didn t enjoy the endless walking endless no fight was tougher than the mile long hikes through the same areas i had plenty of portcrystals set up but at some point almost ran out of ferrystones and it was painful that was near the end when i had thought i had explored most of batthal haha i had not and forced myself to keep going anyway due to the amazing ending i am glad i did but it was definitely a slog and required a lot of willpower i didn t really mind the banter between the pawns too much but it got definitely repetitive same with the small variety of enemies what enemies they threw in were truly epic don t get me wrong the chimeras dragons griffins the medusa the sphinx glorious fights but there simply were too many goblins and wolves and cyclops and trolls and gods did i hate the trolls the side quests were interesting but without google reddit i would not have been able to figure out how to go about some of them i am all for letting people explore and figure things out themselves but that was in places a but too cryptic the story itself was also a bit all over the place but fortunately the true ending definitely made up for that that about sums it up i only ever bought exactly one item with real money and that was one extra portcrystal so the rage about the microtransactions baffles me as you re in no way required to buy any of them other companies are much much worse about that and get no grief over it whatsoever so as i said all in all dd2 was definitely an epic adventure a glorious rpg with great moments monstrous fights and plenty of adventures definitely recommend
