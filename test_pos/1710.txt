2022 so far it s great people have valid complaints about the performance that s fair i have a very middling system and battles are 100 fine for me it s the campaign map that suffers performance issues i trust ca to fix the minor issues and optimization my advice would be if you are on the fence go ahead and give it a couple patches if you are excited by it go for it absolutely recommend it but don t be afraid to wait
