2023 personally i like it but there needs to be more transparency to new players how much money everything cost other than just the game i own all dlc s but a new player could be forgiven for thinking the game is only 60 and then be shocked to learn that 99 of the content is locked behind dlc paywalls that easily reaches hundreds more dollars base game should be free with how little comparatively is included its definitely not worth 60
