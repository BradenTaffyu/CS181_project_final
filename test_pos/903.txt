2022 fromsoftware said hey we ve never done an open world rpg i guess we can take a whack at it then they delivered the best game of the genre in over a decade perhaps ever everything i dislike about modern owrpg games is gone from miyazaki s masterpiece other aaa games just keep copying the success of skyrim but having bigger and bigger maps with wide open level design 1000 map markers telling you exactly where to go and what to do at all times and combat systems that are generally pretty lackluster and simple elden ring shatters all of those contrivances with a fresh approach the world of elden ring is admittedly massive but unlike other games in recent memory no corner of this map ever feels empty or boring the level design is lightyears ahead of most open world games verticality labyrinthine platforming and environmental puzzles are back on the menu after being abandoned by the hundreds of skyrim clones this past decade the legacy dungeons as they are known here are on par with the best of fromsoft s dark souls series which is famous in part due to its long track record for stellar level design the combat system and character customization are familiar for fans of fromsoft s previous entries but in the new context of the ow genre it feels better than it ever has the addition of jumping mechanics simple but satisfying mounted combat and exploration and a heavily customizable weapon skill system compliment the play style of a huge game like this weapon balance has been a bit shaky since the launch of er but recent patches have helped every playstyle feel satisfying and powerful without sacrificing the challenge speaking of difficulty this game is difficult more difficult than people unfamiliar with the developer would expect from a game of this genre but not quite as difficult as the more punishing examples from other souls like games the game does not hold your hand or litter your map with dozens of quest markers and points of interest if your map is marked it s because an npc just told you that they would mark your map or you ve just discovered a new fast travel point the game subtly guides you to the next major objectives through unobtrusive visual cues and context another way the game accomplishes this task is by avoiding the shortcut most developers take to level the challenge to the player s current level elden ring allows you to go wherever you want to go but if you enter an area that you are not supposed to yet then you will be punished by 15 foot tall hyena beasts giant demon crows and plagued wolves that will bleed you out in seconds you will either naturally gravitate back toward the areas appropriate to your level or you will rise to the punishing difficulty and be appropriately rewarded for your determination every area feels rewarding discovery is an element that is difficult to get right even in some of the best ow games ever made the lazy answer to reward exploration is to create 200 collectible items hidden in obscure locations that award trophies or minor character progression elden ring makes genuine exploration feel rewarding nearly every time somehow they have significant secrets hidden nearly everywhere if you spend 5 or 10 minutes striking out into the unknown you are almost certain to find sexy loot a secret dungeon an interesting enemy or npc etc but none of it feels like hooray you found your 147th korok seed a few points of criticism are the performance issues that have been present since the launch despite having graphics that feel more like they were released late last generation there is some persistent stuttering even in the most powerful rigs so a consistent 60 fps can be a bit elusive while the art direction and style are phenomenal as always the graphics themselves are a bit dated this is most likely due in part to the long development of the game and partly due to fromsoft insisting on using their same old engine instead the newer options some long time fans may find the gameplay systems to be a rehash of soulsborne and have heard some fans say that they wanted more variation this time around i personally do not agree with this take as i ve played every single fromsoft game since demon s souls on opening day and elden ring did not strike me as stale but i do understand why some would see it this way i see these drawbacks as very minor in the greater scheme of this game and they do not take anything away from the spectacular execution on virtually every level of game design though i may be slightly biased in favor of fromsoft if i am trying to have a modicum of objectivity i am comfortable saying that i think elden ring is one of the best open world games of the last 15 years in the same tier as the likes of skyrim breath of the wild and the witcher 3 however my more subjective view is that this is likely my favorite game of all time either way this game is an easy 10 10
