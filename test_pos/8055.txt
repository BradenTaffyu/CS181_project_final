2020 early access review i don t like roguelikes i hate dying over and over again i hate the randomness of it all and yet i have 20 hours in noita after buying it a few days ago the game is so addictive the physics of fire and acid never gets old i am always looking forward to trying out new wand combos i have put 20 hours in and feel like i am just beginning to learn interesting new skills tricks it is a game that makes you want to be a better player if you love roguelikes you presumably already own it or you are forbidden from using a computer by the fbi if you don t love roguelikes i am willing to bet money you will love this one there is a reason the reviews at the time of writing are overwhelmingly positive
