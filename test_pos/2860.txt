2021 everybody and their mama knows about this game singleplayer is fun unique funny intense gripping the story isn t perfect or a masterpiece but it s still good it s a pretty old game at this point yet it still competes with anything released this year it looks great has great gameplay well it s the best gta there is couldn t really add anything more online is fun yet it could be improved so much in many different areas first of all the content itself could be much more diverse and less grindy i understand that rockstar games is making bread through microtransactions but still grinding for a hundred hours to buy expensive things can get stale really quick secondly many online mods in gta san andreas had better ideas for businesses and jobs in terms of their mechanics that make gta v slightly underwhelming in that regard next up are griefers damn so many of these stacked up high level kids with flying jet like bikes that can automatically lock on and shoot homing missiles and there goes your slow ass post office van stacked with cocaine that you ve been driving for the past 10 minutes to your destination and waited beforehand for an hour after paying for supplies to produce the product it s a very large gap between newbies and daily grinders it s also pretty overwhelming for a new player at first plenty of activities constant emails and messages no idea where to start or what to do besides the griefers the community itself is pretty good during missions and heists it s true they re mostly bad at their tasks or just can t cooperate properly but it seems that they always apologize for their mistakes and no one really starts insulting each other so that s pretty dope i also have to mention the hackers though i see them constantly the majority of them doesn t even bother me they re mostly just having fun on their own and don t disrupt the crowd lastly the glitches and crashes yes they re pretty common and it seems that rockstar doesn t really care much about the majority of them crashing and losing your valuable product glitching and getting stuck in the middle of the heist or just entering into an infinite loading screen is just another feature at this point though some glitches such as teleporting or playing in a solo lobby are almost necessary to ease your life a tad bit overall a 9 10 if online wasn t a thing i d give an 8 at most
