2018 tl dr game is fun but has moments when you are most decidedly not having fun ratio of fun vs not fun varies depending on experience temperament of yourself and those around you level of intoxication and number of f cks given ok so you re a beginner looking to pick up this game as a survivor i ll tell you right now you re going to hate it at first there s no tutorial and it s kind of like a rogue lite in the sense that it s nearly impossible to accomplish anything when you first start out but even though you die over and over again you still earn bloodpoints that you can spend on items and perks to make yourself just a little bit stronger pretty soon you ll start actually escaping or at least earn enough points to not de rank you can watch all the youtube videos you want but to get better at dbd you re just going to have to play i have no idea what to expect at the higher tiers of gameplay or if i ll even get there at this point but so far i m firmly in a love hate relationship with this game
