2015 well made fun polished and balanced game but if ur looking to play competitively in its current state u will be disappointed the only problem this game has are the horrible servers hit detection is way off and sometimes u die from the position u were 2seconds ago i also have 80hours in beta s and the servers felt better back then its very frustrating and happens very often wait for a netcode fix before u purchase this game update original post 6th of dec 2015 update post 6th of feb 2016 if u are looking to buy this game to mess around with youre friends in casual go ahead if ur looking to play a serious ranked game dont waste ur money on r6s hitbox s are still way off and the gunfights can only be taken seriously half of the time uncluding highest headshot rate of any game ive ever seen and im dmg on csgo match making is a joke and i still cant believe they allow players to bypass the level20 cap on ranked games if they duo with a friend continuous 4v5 s due to there not being a reconnect function the ranked system itself is also very off i win 7 games in a row no rank up to lose the next 2 games in a row and i got derank wich led me to this review update review summary go back to csgo
