2015 as someone who loved battlefield all the way from bf2 4 and everything in between i love the change of pace this game provides it s methodical and tactical will it satisfy the ultra realistic nerds no will it satisfy the cod kiddies no will it satisfy those looking for something less run and gun and more thoughtful yes i ve played about an hour seeing if i should refund it or not and i m glad to say i won t the rounds are quick and brutal the servers so far work fine for me and hell i m playing it on low settings on my surfacebook with a steam controller with 50 60 fps wow
